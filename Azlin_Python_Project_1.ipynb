Beware of the many recipes that include kerosene (coal\\r\\noil), turpentine, ammonium  chloride, lead, lye (sodium hydroxide),\\r\\nstrychnine, arsenic, mercury, creosote, sodium phosphate, opium, cocaine\\r\\nand other illegal, poisonous or corrosive items. Many recipes do not\\r\\nspecify if it is to be taken internally or topically (on the skin). There\\r\\nis an extreme preoccupation with poultices (applied to the skin, 324\\r\\nreferences) and \"keeping the bowels open\" (1498 references, including\\r\\nrelated terms).\\r\\n\\r\\nI view this material as a window into the terror endured by mothers and\\r\\nfamily members when a child or adult took ill. The doctors available (if\\r\\nyou could afford one) could offer little more than this book. The guilt of\\r\\nfailing to cure the child was probably easier to endure than the\\r\\nhelplessness of doing nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are many recipes for foods I fondly remember eating as a child.\\r\\n\\r\\nNote the many recipes for a single serving that involve lengthy and\\r\\nlabor-intensive preparation. Refrigeration was uncommon and the\\r\\ntemperature of iceboxes was well above freezing, so food had to be\\r\\nconsumed quickly.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany recipes use uncooked meat and eggs that can lead to several diseases.\\r\\n\\r\\nObvious typographical errors have been corrected but contemporary spelling\\r\\nand usage are unchanged. Page headers are retained, but are moved to the\\r\\nbeginning of the paragraph where the text is interrupted. Page numbers are\\r\\nshown in brackets [ ].\\r\\n\\r\\nThe author claims the material is directed toward non-medical \"family\"\\r\\nmembers, but many passages are obviously copied from medical textbooks.\\r\\nThe following glossary of unfamiliar (to me) terms is quite lengthy and\\r\\ndoes not include incomprehensible (to me) medical terms and many words and\\r\\nnames I could not find in several reference books. The book\\'s own 16 page\\r\\ndictionary is on page 893.\\r\\n\\r\\nI recommend the article on \"hydrophobia\" (page 241) as an interesting\\r\\nhistory of the Pasture treatment.\\r\\n\\r\\nDon Kostuch\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTranscriber\\'s Dictionary\\r\\n\\r\\nThese entries are absent or brief in the original dictionary on page 893.\\r\\nA short cooking dictionary is on page 831. Check there for items not found\\r\\nhere.\\r\\n\\r\\nacetanilide   (also acetanilid)\\r\\n  White crystalline compound, C6H5NH(COCH3), formerly used to relieve pain\\r\\n  and reduce fever.

[iii]\\r\\n\\r\\nMedicine is not an exact science, and it is reasonable to presume that\\r\\neven Time, with all its qualifying influences, will fail in its effects on\\r\\nthis one branch of science. As the millions of faces seem each to present\\r\\nsome differentiating feature, so each human system seems to require\\r\\nspecial study of its individual temperament.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo physicians find it necessary to have more than one remedy for a given\\r\\nill; they still find truth in the old adage, \"What is one man\\'s meat is\\r\\nanother\\'s poison.\" But Mother finds a variety of remedies necessary for\\r\\nanother reason. Her medicine-chest is usually lacking the full quota of\\r\\ndrugs required to meet the many emergencies, and she must turn to the\\r\\n\"remedy at hand.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNecessity has again proved its influence and with the years thousands of\\r\\nsimple home concoctions have found their way to the relief of the daily\\r\\ndemands on Mother\\'s ingenuity. These mothers\\' remedies have become a\\r\\nvaluable asset to the raising of a family, and have become a recognized\\r\\nessential in a Mother\\'s general equipment for home-making.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor fifteen years the Publisher has handled so-called home medical works;\\r\\nduring that time he has had occasion to examine practically all the home\\r\\nmedical works published. He has been impressed with the utter uselessness\\r\\nof many, perhaps most, of these books because the simple home remedies\\r\\nwere lacking.\\r\\n\\r\\nA few years ago he conceived the idea of gathering together the \"Mothers\\'\\r\\nRemedies\" of the world. This one feature of this book he claims as\\r\\ndistinctly his own. Letters were sent by him to Mothers in every state and\\r\\nterritory of the United States, and to Canada and other countries, asking\\r\\nfor tried and tested \"Mothers\\' Remedies.\" The appeal was met with prompt\\r\\nreplies, and between one thousand and two thousand valuable remedies were\\r\\ncollected in this way.\\r\\n\\r\\nThrough courtesy to these Mothers who helped to make this book possible,\\r\\nthe book was named \"MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. T. J. Ritter, of Ann Arbor, Michigan, a graduate of the regular School\\r\\nof Medicine at the University of Michigan, at Ann Arbor, and later one of\\r\\nthe medical staff of the University, consented to furnish the necessary\\r\\nmaterial to complete the Medical Department. Dr. Ritter, in over thirty\\r\\nyears of actual practice, has met with all the exigencies of both city and\\r\\ncountry practice which have brought to him the ripe experience of what\\r\\nwould be called a \"physician\\'s life-time.\" His success has been, in part,\\r\\ndue to his honesty, kindliness and conscientiousness, as well as to his\\r\\nthorough training and natural adaptability to the profession.\\r\\n\\r\\nBesides writing the Causes, Symptoms, Preventives, Nursing, Diet,\\r\\nPhysicians\\' Treatment, etc., he has examined each and every one of the\\r\\nMothers\\' Remedies and added, when possible, the reason why that remedy is\\r\\nvaluable. In short, he supplied in his remarks following each Mother\\'s\\r\\nRemedy the Medical virtue or active principle of the ingredients. This\\r\\nlifts each Mother\\'s Remedy into the realm of science,--in fact, to the\\r\\nlevel of a Doctor\\'s Prescription.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn writing his part, Dr. Ritter consulted, personally or through their\\r\\nworks, considerably over one hundred of the acknowledged Medical\\r\\nSpecialists of the world. Thus he has brought to you the latest\\r\\ndiscoveries of modern science,--the Medical knowledge of the world\\'s great\\r\\nspecialists.\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Ritter, therefore, wishes to acknowledge his indebtedness to the\\r\\nfollowing: On the subject of Theory and Practice, to Dr. Wm. Osler, Oxford\\r\\nUniversity, England; Dr. James M. Andres, Ph.

On the subject of Nursing, to\\r\\nIsabel Hampton Robb, and on Dietetics, to Dr. Julius Friedenwald, College\\r\\nPhysicians and Surgeons, Baltimore, Md. On the Baby to Drs. Holt, Douglas,\\r\\nTooker, Koplik and Coolidge. On Insanity, to Dr. Selden Talcott, formerly\\r\\nsuperintendent of the Middleton State Hospital for the Insane, New York\\r\\nState. Besides the above a great many other physicians and their works\\r\\nmight be mentioned, and to all appreciation is gratefully acknowledged.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Elizabeth Johnstone, who writes the department on \"Manners and Social\\r\\nCustoms,\" is the only daughter of the late Francis Gardiner, one of the\\r\\nearly settlers of Washtenaw County, Michigan. She was educated at the\\r\\nState Normal School, now the Normal College at Ypsilanti, and taught for\\r\\nseveral years after graduation. In 1880 she married the late Robert\\r\\nFerguson Johnstone, editor of the Michigan Farmer, and after his death\\r\\nbecame editor of the Household Department of that paper. In 1895, the\\r\\nFarmer having passed into other ownership, she became a member of the\\r\\nEditorial Staff of the Detroit Free Press, where,--continuing to write\\r\\nunder the pseudonym of \"Beatrix\" she has become widely known through the\\r\\nvast circulation of that paper.\\r\\n\\r\\nYears of experience have enabled her to write on topics of interest to\\r\\nwomen with comprehension of their needs, and to answer social inquiries\\r\\nwith exactness.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Edna Gertrude Thompson, who supplies the chapter on Domestic Science,\\r\\nis a graduate of the Northern State Normal of Michigan. She was for a time\\r\\na teacher in the Public Schools of Michigan and New York State. Miss\\r\\nThompson later graduated from and is now the director of the Domestic\\r\\nScience Department of the Thomas Normal Training School of Detroit,\\r\\nMichigan.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Thompson has won an enviable reputation in Domestic Science work. She\\r\\nhas avoided all of the quackery, self-exploitation and money schemes,\\r\\nwhich have proved a temptation to many in the work, and which have tended\\r\\nto brand the science as an advertising scheme, and confined herself to\\r\\nstudy, teaching and the legitimate development of the science. Her work in\\r\\nthe Normal and in giving lectures on Domestic Science brings her in touch\\r\\nwith large numbers of intelligent and practical women who realize that\\r\\nhousekeeping and cookery must be reduced to a science. Luxuries of fifty\\r\\nyears ago are necessities today. The increase in the cost of living\\r\\nwithout a corresponding advance in wages has made it imperative that\\r\\nmethod and system he installed in the home.\\r\\n\\r\\nDomestic Science is still in the embryo, but let us hope it will, in a\\r\\nmeasure at least, prove a panacea for modern domestic ills and receive the\\r\\nencouragement and speedy endorsement that it deserves.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTABLE OF CONTENTS [vii]\\r\\n\\r\\n                                          Beginning on Page\\r\\nMEDICAL DEPARTMENT                               1\\r\\n

It is the most patient and\\r\\ncheerful of companions. It does not turn its back upon us in times of\\r\\nadversity or distress. It always receives us with the same kindness.\"\\r\\n--S. SMILES.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf making books there seems no end. Some are good, some bad, and many just\\r\\nan encumbrance upon the book-shelves, neither of much use nor particularly\\r\\nharmful. Some books are to be read for cheer and amusement; some for\\r\\nreproof and correction; others to be studied for useful information and\\r\\nprofit.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Ideal Book.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is a wide felt need for a worthy book of sound hygienic and medical\\r\\nfacts for the non-medical people. The Ideal Book for this mission should\\r\\nbe compact in form, but large enough to give the salient facts, and give\\r\\nthese in understandable language; it must not be \"loaded\" with obsolete\\r\\nand useless junk of odds and ends which have long ceased to be even\\r\\ninteresting; it must carry with it the stamp of genuine reliability; it\\r\\nshould treat all the ordinary and most common forms of ailments and\\r\\naccidents; it must be safe in its teachings; it needs to be free from\\r\\nobjectionable language and illustrations, so that all of any family may\\r\\nstudy and use it with profit; it must frequently warn of dangers ahead and\\r\\nurge the summoning of professional skill promptly, for there are many\\r\\ncases requiring the services of experienced physicians and surgeons in\\r\\ntheir treatment; it should advise remedies readily obtainable, as well as\\r\\nthose for which long journeys to a drug store are required; and finally\\r\\nthe book should be reasonable in price that those who most need it can\\r\\nafford to own it.\\r\\n\\r\\nNeed of Brevity.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe facts of hygiene and therapeutic measures are widely scattered through\\r\\nmedical literature, and extend over hundreds of years of time. Many\\r\\nvolumes have been written on diseases of the eye, the heart, liver, and\\r\\nstomach, brain and other organs, to understand which requires special\\r\\ntechnical education. It would be the height of folly to present these\\r\\ndiscussions to the laity in their original form, hence the necessity for\\r\\ncondensation and presentation of the needful facts in the language of the\\r\\npeople in whose interests the book is printed. In a book of fiction there\\r\\nmay be need for useless verbiage for the sake of \"making pages,\" but facts\\r\\nof vital importance and usefulness in our daily welfare need to be well\\r\\nboiled down and put into shape for ready reference. This has been done in\\r\\n\"Mothers\\' Remedies\" and I think it quite fulfills the ideal I have\\r\\noutlined above.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe title is rather odd upon first seeing it, but the most plausible when\\r\\nyou become acquainted with its import. It surely becomes the best friend\\r\\nof the whole family. \"It does not turn its back upon us in times of\\r\\nadversity,\" but cheerfully answers a thousand and one questions of vital\\r\\nimportance to the household. In the hour of distress, when illness or\\r\\naccident befalls the dear ones, you may turn again and again to its pages\\r\\nwithout meeting disappointment.\\r\\n\\r\\nIts Value. [x]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are many books on household medicines, but in my opinion\\r\\nthis is the most useful of them all, a very present help in time of need.\\r\\nYou can go to it for helpful information without failing to find it. Is\\r\\nthere serious illness in the house? It will tell you about it concisely\\r\\nand plainly, describing its symptoms, nature and course, and advise you to\\r\\nconsult the family physician if of a serious nature before it is too late.\\r\\nIn the chapters on accidents, emergencies and poisons, it tells you what\\r\\nto do at once while awaiting the doctor\\'s arrival. He will be much pleased\\r\\nto see that you have made the proper effort to treat the case. Prompt\\r\\ntreatment makes for prompt recovery.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe real value of any book, or what is sometimes called its intrinsic\\r\\nvalue, or utility, consists in what it avails to gratify some desire or\\r\\nwant of our nature. It depends, then, wholly upon its qualities in\\r\\nrelation to our desires. That which contributes in ever so small degree to\\r\\nthe wellbeing of humanity is of greater value than silver or gold. This\\r\\nbook contains hundreds of prescriptions, anyone of which will repay the\\r\\nsmall cost in money that it requires to possess it. In fact, the financial\\r\\ninvestment is so small when compared with the benefit derived from its\\r\\npages that this feature need not be considered.\\r\\n\\r\\nExamples.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the stillness and loneliness of the night, away from medical help,\\r\\nthere comes the hoarse barking cough of the child, perhaps, and a case of\\r\\ncroup is upon the responsibility of the parents. The struggles and terror\\r\\nof the little patient throws the household into consternation, and all is\\r\\nexcitement in a moment. If the mother ever knew what to do in such a case\\r\\nshe is likely not able to recall the exact remedy at this time, the doctor\\r\\nis miles away, and the case is urgent.\\r\\n\\r\\nA reference to the medical index of \"Mothers\\' Remedies\" under croup shows\\r\\nthat on pages 27, 28 and 29, is a full description of the attack, and\\r\\nthere are fifteen (15) home remedies given, many of which can be found in\\r\\nthe house, and the spasm may be stopped by the use of one of them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is only one example of the use of this book. There are innumerable\\r\\ntimes when cases come up in the home, or accidents befall a dear one and a\\r\\nready remedy is required; the book most likely contains it, and is willing\\r\\nto tell you if you consult it carefully.\\r\\n\\r\\nTuberculosis.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe article on tuberculosis is full of valuable rules on diet and hygiene\\r\\nfor every person, whether he has the disease or not. A knowledge of the\\r\\ndangers and mode of spreading the disease is the best safeguard against\\r\\nhaving it. Where one person in every seven (7) dies of consumption it\\r\\nbecomes imperative that full knowledge of the disease and its prevention\\r\\nshould become widespread.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccidents and Poisons. [xii]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother department that illustrates the value of the book is that on\\r\\nAccidents and Poisons, where quick action is needed to prevent great\\r\\nsuffering and danger and the salvation of life itself. One cannot always\\r\\nget the doctor in time. A quick reference to this part of the book will\\r\\ngive the proper course of action to follow. The indicated mother\\'s remedy\\r\\nor the physician\\'s treatment as given here applied in the \"nick of time\"\\r\\nwill save many a life in cases of burns, or accidental poisoning, or\\r\\nhemorrhage. I have been called in such cases where a simple drink of warm\\r\\nmustard water promptly used would have saved a life in carbolic acid\\r\\npoisoning. It is in the emergencies where a ready knowledge of the ways\\r\\nand means necessary to conserve life is most valuable; and it is in just\\r\\nsuch emergencies that one is most apt to forget what is best to do that a\\r\\ncopy of Mothers\\' Remedies becomes a priceless boon of helpfulness.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll About Baby.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Woman\\'s Department, and the chapter on \"All About Baby,\" alone contain\\r\\npriceless information for the guidance of the women of the home. It is\\r\\nlike having a good doctor right in the house who is ready and able to\\r\\nanswer more than 500 questions of vital interest about Baby. The book is\\r\\nthoroughly reliable, free from exaggerated statements and written in the\\r\\nplainest language possible so as to make it useful to every member of the\\r\\nhome. The Herb Department gives a brief description of the more common and\\r\\nmost useful plants and roots, with the time for gathering them, and the\\r\\ndose and therapeutic indication for their use. The botanical illustrations\\r\\nare correct and worthy of careful study.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE INDEX.\\r\\n\\r\\nMothers\\' Remedies is unique in arrangement, and full of detail, but so\\r\\nwell indexed that any portion of it, or any disease and remedy, can be\\r\\nreadily found, and when found you will have a choice of home remedies\\r\\nready at hand. This is one of the features of the book that distinguishes\\r\\nMothers\\' Remedies from the usual home medical books heretofore sold.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis feature of the book cannot be too strongly impressed. Its value\\r\\nbecomes apparent as soon as one consults its pages. Long chapters of\\r\\ndescriptive reading filled with high sounding, technical terms may look\\r\\nvery learned because the average reader does not understand it fully. But\\r\\nit is what one can obtain from a book that is usable that makes it\\r\\nvaluable. In Mothers\\' Remedies this idea has been excellently carried out.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Home Remedies.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf there was any question regarding the success of the book in this\\r\\nhomelike arrangement, the utilization of the home remedies, in addition to\\r\\nthe strictly medical and drug-store ingredients; it was promptly dispelled\\r\\nwhen the book was printed and presented to the people interested. It has\\r\\nproved to be the most wonderful seller on the market--the most usable and\\r\\nuseful book ever offered the non-medical reader; because never before has\\r\\na medical book contained the hundreds of simple home remedies from\\r\\nmothers. Because a physician tells you why the remedies are useful--the\\r\\nreason why the things used are efficacious.\\r\\n\\r\\nMedical Terms.  [xiii]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrequently one comes across technical terms in the secular papers which,\\r\\nunless understood, obscure the sense of the reading. There is a dictionary\\r\\nof medical terms as a separate department which adds much to the\\r\\nusefulness of the work; the spelling, pronunciation and definition being\\r\\nconcisely given in English.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther Departments.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are other departments, such as chapters on Manners and Social\\r\\nCustoms, by an expert. Nursery Hints, Candy Making, Domestic Science, and\\r\\nMiscellaneous departments which interest every member of any average\\r\\nfamily in health as well as in sickness. The Candy Department provides\\r\\nmany an evening\\'s enjoyment for the young people.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition, the book gives under each disease the physician\\'s remedies,\\r\\nthe symptoms, causes, preventives wherever important, the diet, nursing,\\r\\nnecessity for operations, and much other needful information for the\\r\\nsick-room. A complete chapter on Nursing and a detailed account of the\\r\\nBaby and its care is perhaps the most useful portion of the book to the\\r\\nmothers who desire to learn all about the baby. Many home medical books\\r\\nare of doubtful value by reason of exaggerated statements or vague and\\r\\nunusable directions regarding treatments. Mothers\\' Remedies stands\\r\\nsquarely upon the foundation of utility and practical every-day\\r\\nusefulness. No matter how many other home medical books one may have, this\\r\\nis also needful because there\\'s none other on the market like it. One of\\r\\nthe missions of Mothers\\' Remedies in the home is the prevention of disease\\r\\nthrough its sound sanitary teachings. It was written exclusively for home\\r\\nuse, and its instructions can be followed by anyone who can understand\\r\\nplain English, and the home remedies are extensively explained and\\r\\nrecommended so that in emergencies one can always find something of value\\r\\nto use while awaiting the surgeon\\'s arrival. It is a well-spring of\\r\\nusefulness in any home, and it gives me genuine pleasure to call attention\\r\\nto it in these few lines, and to bespeak for it the continued enthusiastic\\r\\nreception with which it has met heretofore.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Signed) WM.

There may be nausea and vomiting; there\\r\\nis usually a sudden onset of pain, often sharp and severe in the whole or\\r\\npart of the abdomen. Later the pain settles in the right groin. Patient\\r\\nlies on his back with his right knee drawn up. The muscles become rigid on\\r\\nthe right side and later a lump appears in the right groin (iliac fossa).\\r\\n\\r\\nANEMIA.--This disease is a diminution of the total quantity of the blood\\r\\nof its red cells, or red corpuscles or of their Haemoglobin, the coloring\\r\\nmatter of the red corpuscles. Some difficulty of breathing. Palpitation\\r\\non least exertion, tendency to faint, headache, tired, irritable, poor or\\r\\nchangeable appetite, digestive disturbances, constipation, cold hands and\\r\\nfeet, difficult and painful menstruation (dysmenorrhea), irregular\\r\\nmenstruation, leucorrhea. And when the skin is pale, yellowish green\\r\\ntinge, with perhaps flushed cheeks, it might properly be called chlorosis\\r\\nor \"green sickness.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nADDISON\\'S DISEASE.--Great weakness, stomach and bowel disorders, weak\\r\\nheart and dark coloring (pigmentation) of the skin.\\r\\n\\r\\nBRIGHT\\'S DISEASE.--Albumin and casts in the urine. The onset is usually\\r\\ngradual. There is paleness and puffiness of the eyelids, ankles or hands\\r\\nin the morning. Later increased dropsy of face and the extremities, pasty\\r\\nyellow complexion, dyspepsia, constipation and heart symptom.\\r\\n\\r\\n[2 MOTHERS\\' DIAGNOSIS]\\r\\n\\r\\nBRONCHITIS, ACUTE. (Cold on the Chest.)--There is a feeling of\\r\\ntightness under the breastbone, with a dry hard cough and headache. This\\r\\ncough may make the chest feel raw and sore, especially in front.\\r\\n\\r\\nCHOLERA MORBUS.--The onset is usually sudden with nausea, vomiting, and\\r\\ncramp-like bowel pains; vomits at first the stomach contents. Purging\\r\\nfollows; vomiting and purging with severe cramps in abdomen and legs.\\r\\n\\r\\nCROUP.--Child wakes up suddenly, perhaps at midnight, with a harsh barking\\r\\ncough, with difficulty of breathing, and it looks as if it could not get\\r\\nanother breath. Then there is an easy spell and soon the spasm recurs.\\r\\n\\r\\nCANCER OF THE STOMACH.--There is anemia and a gradual loss of weight. A\\r\\npeculiar color of the skin (cachexia), irregular vomiting, some bleeding\\r\\nof \"coffee-ground\" color. Progressive loss of weight. Dragging or burning\\r\\nin the region of the stomach.\\r\\n\\r\\nCHICKEN POX.--Slight fever, chilly feelings. In twenty-four hours the\\r\\neruption appears upon the body, face and forehead often only a few\\r\\nseparate red pimples which soon become rounded vesicles; however, there\\r\\nmay be few or many.\\r\\n\\r\\nDIABETES.--The onset is gradual, glucose (sugar) is persistently in the\\r\\nurine. Great quantity of urine passed; six to forty pints in twenty-four\\r\\nhours. Thirst is great. Large quantities of water is taken. Loss of\\r\\nstrength and weight, mouth is dry, tongue is red and glazed, skin is dry\\r\\nand wrinkled.\\r\\n\\r\\nDIPHTHERIA.--This disease begins gradually, as a rule, with chilly\\r\\nfeelings, pain in the back and limbs, pulse is faster, with a general\\r\\nredness of the throat before the formation of the membrane; with such\\r\\nsymptoms there are great weakness, paleness, and a bad smelling breath.\\r\\nSoon a spot or spots may be seen on the tonsils, uvula or soft palate, but\\r\\nin a day or two a dirty white patch is seen on the tonsils and this may\\r\\nspread, and with it there is increased weakness, pallor, loss of appetite\\r\\nand fever. When the membrane is taken off of the tonsils there is left a\\r\\nraw surface, and the membrane rapidly reforms.\\r\\n\\r\\nDYSENTERY.--The onset may be marked by diarrhea, followed by a severe,\\r\\ncramp-like bowel pain, with frequent small stools containing blood and\\r\\nmucus and accompanied by much straining (tenesmus).\\r\\n\\r\\nDYSPEPSIA, ACUTE. (Acute Gastritis, Acute Indigestion).--Distress in the\\r\\nstomach, headache, thirst, nausea, vomiting, tongue heavily coated, foul\\r\\nbreath, distaste for food, tender stomach.\\r\\n\\r\\n[3 MOTHERS\\' DIAGNOSIS]\\r\\n\\r\\nERYSIPELAS.--The onset is sudden, high fever, and a local redness with a\\r\\nsharply defined margin between it and a healthy skin. It frequently\\r\\nappears upon the nose and spreads over one cheek or both. It may show only\\r\\na smooth raised skin, or there may be vesicles.\\r\\n\\r\\nEARACHE.--This is very common in children. It comes frequently as an\\r\\nextension through the eustachian canal of a cold. The ache is only an\\r\\nevidence of congestion or inflammation in the ear. The child bursts out\\r\\ncrying violently and nothing seems to make it stop. It may cry for some\\r\\ntime then stop. When it is very young it is restless, and wants to move\\r\\nconstantly, and refuses to be comforted by the soothing embraces of its\\r\\nmother. It is quiet only a few moments at a time and again renews its\\r\\ncries and restlessness. The cries are moaning and seem like hopeless\\r\\ncries. A child or infant that cries that way and will not be quieted,\\r\\nshould be suspected of having earache, and hot applications of dry or wet\\r\\nheat should be applied to the ear. If such symptoms are neglected, in a\\r\\nfew days you are likely to have a discharge running from the external\\r\\ncanal (meatus) and perhaps permanent injury may be done to the drum\\r\\nmembrane by ulceration. Warm water poured in the ear frequently relieves\\r\\ncommon earache.\\r\\n\\r\\nGALL STONES.--Sudden agonizing pain in the right upper abdomen in the\\r\\nregion of the liver, with vomiting, prostration, tenderness in that\\r\\nregion. Pain generally comes at intervals in paroxysms. There may be pains\\r\\nin the stomach during the weeks when the attack is absent and the patient\\r\\nmay think the stomach is the seat of the trouble.\\r\\n\\r\\nIRITIS.--Pain is severe and worse at night, the iris looks cloudy, muddy,\\r\\nthe pupil is small. There is congestion around the iris (ciliary\\r\\ncongestion).\\r\\n\\r\\nKIDNEY STONES.--Pain goes from the kidneys down through the ureter into\\r\\nthe bladder and into the scrotum. There may be sand in the urine that\\r\\nmakes it look like blood.\\r\\n\\r\\nLA GRIPPE--The onset is usually sudden, with a chill, and all of the\\r\\nsymptoms of an active fever, headache, bone-ache, a general ache all over.\\r\\nA feeling of extreme weakness; feels miserable and sick.\\r\\n\\r\\nLOCK-JAW (Tetanus).--History of a wound. The muscles of the jaw may be\\r\\nstiff and set. When there are spasms the muscles remain stiff and hard for\\r\\nsome time.\\r\\n\\r\\nMALARIAL FEVER.--Chill, fever, and sweat, or one stage may be absent.\\r\\nThere may be only a slight chilly feeling with fever almost all day and\\r\\nthen remission.\\r\\n\\r\\n[4 MOTHERS\\' DIAGNOSIS]\\r\\n\\r\\nMUMPS.--The swelling is in front and below and behind the ear. Hard to eat\\r\\nand the swallowing of vinegar is almost impossible.\\r\\n\\r\\nMEASLES.--Comes on gradually. There is a feeling of tiredness and languor,\\r\\nheadache followed shortly by sneezing, cold symptoms, running at the eyes,\\r\\ndry throat, cough, much like an ordinary cold in the head, but with a\\r\\npersistent, hard racking cough. The eruption appears first in the sides of\\r\\nthe mouth, in the inner surface of the cheeks, lips, gums and soft palate,\\r\\nin size from that of a pin-head to that of a split pea. It appears then\\r\\nabout the eyes and then on the face, chest and extremities. It is first in\\r\\nred spots and then gets blotchy. This is usually three to six days after\\r\\nthe appearance of the cold (catarrh) symptoms.\\r\\n\\r\\nMEASLES (German).--Chilliness, slight fever, pain in the back and legs,\\r\\ncoryza. The eruption appears on the first or second day, on the face, then\\r\\non the chest and in twenty-four hours over the whole body. The glands\\r\\nunder the jaw enlarge.\\r\\n\\r\\nOPHTHALMIA NEONATORUM.       (Inflammation of Eyes at Birth).--A severe\\r\\nconjunctivitis in the newly-born baby, swelling and redness usually of\\r\\nboth eyes, occurring on the second or third day after birth; very soon\\r\\nthere is a discharge and shortly it becomes creamy pus which runs from the\\r\\neyes when the lids are parted.\\r\\n\\r\\nPLEURISY.--The onset may be sudden or gradual. Sudden with a chill, fever,\\r\\na severe sharp pain, stitch in the side, made worse by respiration,\\r\\ncoughing or moving. The cough is dry. The pain is near the breast and\\r\\nsometimes it extends to the back.\\r\\n\\r\\nPNEUMONIA.--It begins with a chill, fever, pain in the lungs,\\r\\nexpectoration with cough, and the material spit up may be mixed with blood\\r\\n(rusty sputa). Then also rapid rise of temperature, \"grunting\" breathing,\\r\\nthe nostrils dilate, and the cheeks are flushed.\\r\\n\\r\\nRHEUMATIC FEVER OR INFLAMMATORY RHEUMATISM.--A number of joints become\\r\\ninvolved. It spreads from one joint to another, very painful joints;\\r\\nprofuse sweating.\\r\\n\\r\\nSMALLPOX.--The onset is sudden and ushered in by a chill, nausea and\\r\\nvomiting, headache, and severe pains in the back and legs, without grip\\r\\nsymptoms. There is a rapid rise of  temperature. Usually on the fourth day\\r\\nafter the onset small red pimples appear on the forehead, along the line\\r\\nof the hair and on the wrists. The temperature falls with the appearance\\r\\nof the eruption.\\r\\n\\r\\nSPOTTED FEVER.--Marked loss of appetite, chill, projectile vomiting,\\r\\nsevere headache, pain and stiffness of the back and neck. Later head is\\r\\ndrawn back, often the back is rigid. The muscles of the neck and back are\\r\\nvery tender.\\r\\n\\r\\n[5 MOTHERS\\' DIAGNOSIS]\\r\\n\\r\\nSCARLET FEVER. (Scarlatina).--Comes on suddenly with loss of appetite,\\r\\nheadache, sick stomach, perhaps vomiting, high fever, sore throat,\\r\\nvomiting may persist. The tongue is coated, edges are red; later it is red\\r\\nand rough; the so-called strawberry tongue. Usually within twenty-four\\r\\nhours an eruption appears, first upon the neck and chest which spreads\\r\\nrapidly over the face and the rest of the body. The eruption consists of\\r\\nred pimply elevations about the size of a pin-head, very close together,\\r\\nso that the body seems to be covered with a scarlet flush. If you look\\r\\nclosely you can see these little pimply elevations.\\r\\n\\r\\nTUBERCULOSIS OF THE LUNGS.--Irregular temperatures, respiration is more\\r\\nfrequent than normal, pulse is rapid, cough, expectoration, night sweats,\\r\\nperhaps, and general failure of strength.\\r\\n\\r\\nTONSILITIS. (Smooth and Follicular).--Commences with a chill, rapid rise\\r\\nof temperature, general aching in the back, and legs especially. The\\r\\ntonsils are large and red and spots may appear on them in a few hours.\\r\\nThere may be no spots but a smooth; red, swollen tonsil, sometimes swollen\\r\\nto an enormous size. The spot and membrane, if any exists, are easily\\r\\nrubbed off and when this is done a glistening surface is seen, but not\\r\\nraw, as in diphtheria.\\r\\n\\r\\nTYPHOID FEVER--There is a feeling of illness for a week or two and the\\r\\npatient is not able to work much, does not sleep well, dreams, has a dull\\r\\nheadache, back of the neck may be stiff, nosebleed sometimes, with a\\r\\nfeeling as if there was some fever, increasing feeling of weakness, and\\r\\nsick feeling. Finally the fever, etc., becomes more prominent with\\r\\nconstipation and diarrhea.\\r\\n\\r\\nULCER OF THE CORNEA.--Light hurts the eyes very much, tears run freely and\\r\\nthere is a feeling of something in the eye. The eyeball shows a rim of\\r\\npink congestion about the cornea. The ulcer can be seen.\\r\\n\\r\\nULCER OF THE STOMACH.--Pain, local tenderness, bleeding. Distress after\\r\\neating and vomiting of a very acid fluid. Pain in the region of the\\r\\nstomach and usually sharp pain in the back is the most constant symptom.\\r\\nIt is increased by food at once and relieved by vomiting. The tenderness\\r\\nupon pressure is usually marked and is localized.\\r\\n\\r\\nWHOOPING-COUGH.--Begins with symptoms of a cold in the eyes, nose, and the\\r\\nchest. The cough gradually becomes worse, usually in from seven to ten\\r\\ndays; it comes in paroxysms (spells) and then the whoop.\\r\\n\\r\\nRESPIRATORY DISEASES [6]\\r\\nIncluding CROUP, COLDS, SORE-THROAT, HOARSENESS,\\r\\nBRONCHITIS, ASTHMA, HAY-FEVER, PLEURISY,\\r\\nADENOIDS, PNEUMONIA, ETC.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith Definition, Cause, Symptoms, Preventives,\\r\\nMothers\\' Remedies, Physicians\\' Treatment;\\r\\nalso Diet, Nursing and Sanitary Care; all for Home\\r\\nUse and Reference.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE ANATOMY OF THE NOSE.--The nose is divided by a middle partition\\r\\n(septum) into two cavities (nasal chambers or fossae) each being a\\r\\nwedge-shaped cavity, distinct by itself and extending from the nostril or\\r\\nanterior nares in front to the posterior openings behind and from the base\\r\\nof the skull to the hard palate below. Where the posterior opening or\\r\\nnares ends is called the nose-pharynx, The pharynx joins there with the\\r\\ncavities and hence called nose-pharynx. The partition (septum) is thin,\\r\\none-tenth to one-eighth of an inch in thickness and is composed in front\\r\\nof cartilage (gristle) and behind of bone. In its normal state this\\r\\npartition (septum) should be perfectly straight, thin and in the middle\\r\\nline, The cartilaginous (gristle) portion is seldom found in this\\r\\ncondition as, owing to its prominent location and frequent exposure to\\r\\ninjury, blows and falling on the nose, the partition (septum) is often\\r\\nbent or turned to one side or the other so far in some cases as to close\\r\\nthe nostril. The posterior part is composed of bone, and being well\\r\\nprotected, is seldom found out of position or displaced, even when the\\r\\ncartilaginous portion is often badly deformed, The floor of the nose is\\r\\nformed by the upper jaw bone (maxillary) and the palate bone. The outer\\r\\nwall of the nose or nose cavity is the most complicated, for it presents\\r\\nthree prominences, the turbinated bones, which extend from before\\r\\nbackwards and partially divide the nose cavity into incomplete spaces\\r\\ncalled meatus passages. The turbinated bones are three in number, the\\r\\ninferior, middle and superior. They vary in size and shape, and owing to\\r\\nthe relations they hear to the surrounding parts, and to the influence\\r\\nthey exert on the general condition of the nose and throat, are of great\\r\\nimportance. The inferior or lower turbinate bone is the largest and in a\\r\\nway is the only independent bone. The middle and superior are small. They\\r\\nare all concave in shape and extend from before backwards, and beneath the\\r\\nconcave surface of each one of the corresponding passages or openings\\r\\n(meatus) is formed. The inferior or lower (meatus) opening or passage is\\r\\nthat part of the nasal (nose) passage which lies beneath the inferior\\r\\nturbinate bone and extends from the nostrils in front to the passage\\r\\nbehind the nose (post-nasal) (posterior nares) toward the pharynx. The\\r\\nmiddle opening (meatus) lies above the inferior turbinate bone and below\\r\\nthe middle turbinate bone. The superior opening (meatus) is situated above\\r\\nthe middle turbinate bone.\\r\\n\\r\\n[RESPIRATORY DISEASES 7]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Bronchial Tubes and Lungs.]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mucous membrane lining the nasal passages is similar to other mucous\\r\\nmembranes. It is here called the Schneiderian membrane after the name of a\\r\\nGerman anatomist named Schneider. It is continuous through the ducts with\\r\\nthe mucous membrane of all the various accessory cavities of the nose. It\\r\\nis quite thin, in the upper part over the superior turbinate bone and\\r\\npartition (septum) while it is quite thick over the lower turbinate bone,\\r\\nthe floor of the nose cavity and the lower part of the partition. It is\\r\\nwell supplied with blood vessels, veins, and glands for producing the\\r\\nnecessary secretion.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe nose is an organ of breathing (respiration) and it warms and moistens\\r\\nthe air we breathe and arrests particles of dust in the air before they\\r\\nenter the lungs. If the air we breathe is of an uneven temperature, or of\\r\\nmarked degree of dryness, or if it is saturated with impurities, it always\\r\\nacts as a source of irritation to the mucous membrane of the upper\\r\\nrespiratory tract, like the larynx. By the time the air reaches the\\r\\npharynx, through the nose, it has become almost as warm as the blood, and\\r\\nalso is well saturated with moisture. The mucous membrane that lines the\\r\\nnose cavity and especially that part over the lower turbinate bone,\\r\\nsecretes from sixteen to twenty ounces of fluid daily. This fluid cleanses\\r\\nand lubricates the nose and moistens the air we breathe. Conditions may\\r\\narise which interfere with this natural secretion. This may be due to the\\r\\nfact that some of the glands have shrunk or wasted (atrophied) and the\\r\\nsecretion has become thick. This collects in the nose, decomposes and\\r\\nforms scabs and crusts in the nostrils. In this condition there will be\\r\\ndropping of mucus into the throat. This condition is usually only a\\r\\ncollection of  secretions from the nose,--which are too thick to flow\\r\\naway,--collect in the space behind the nose, and when some have\\r\\naccumulated, drop into the pharynx.\\r\\n\\r\\n[8 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn order to be in good health it is necessary to breath through the nose,\\r\\nand to do this there must be nothing in the nose or upper part of the\\r\\npharynx to interfere with the free circulation of the air through these\\r\\ncavities. The cavities of the nose may be partly closed by polpi (tumors)\\r\\non the upper and middle turbinate bone, a spur on the (septum) partition,\\r\\ndeviation of the partition or enlarged turbinate bones, or adenoids in the\\r\\nupper part of the pharynx. These troubles almost close up the nose\\r\\nsometimes and the person is compelled to breathe through his mouth. He not\\r\\nonly looks foolish, talks thick, but is laying up for himself future\\r\\ntrouble. By correcting the trouble in the nose and removing the adenoids\\r\\nin the upper part of the pharynx the patient can breathe through the nasal\\r\\npassages. If you take a tube you can pass it straight back through the\\r\\nlower channel (meatus) into the pharynx. It will touch the upper back wall\\r\\nof the pharynx. If the tube has a downward bend you can see it behind the\\r\\nsoft palate and by attaching a string to that end you can draw it back out\\r\\nthrough the nostrils. In that way we plug the posterior openings (nares).\\r\\nThe upper part of the pharynx reaches higher up behind than a line drawn\\r\\nhorizontally above the tip of the nose to the pharynx. It reaches forward\\r\\nabove the soft palate on its front surface. Its front surface is almost\\r\\ndirectly on a vertical line with tonsil, above the soft palate. On its\\r\\nupper part and on the side near the nose cavity is the opening of the\\r\\neustachian tube.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe name naso-pharynx means the junction of the nose and pharynx.\\r\\nSometimes the upper posterior wall of the pharynx, called the vault of the\\r\\npharynx, especially the part behind each eustachian tube, is filled almost\\r\\nfull with adenoids. These are overgrowths or thickenings of the glandular\\r\\ntissue in the upper posterior wall of the pharynx (vault of the pharynx).\\r\\n\\r\\nADENOIDS. (Pharyngeal Tonsil, Lursehkas Tonsil, Adenoid Vegetation, Post-\\r\\nnasal Growth.)--Adenoids are overgrowths or thickenings of the glandular\\r\\ntissue in the vault (top) of the pharynx. They are on the upper posterior\\r\\nwall of the pharynx, often filling the whole space, especially the part\\r\\nbehind the ear-tube--eustachian tube.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey are a soft pliable mass, well supplied with blood vessels, especially\\r\\nin children. Some are firmer and these are the kind seen in adults. The\\r\\ncolor varies from pale pink to dark red. The structure is similar to\\r\\nenlarged tonsils.\\r\\n\\r\\n[RESPIRATORY DISEASES 9]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Adenoids]\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--Children breathe chiefly or wholly through the mouth. They are\\r\\napt to breathe noisily, especially when they eat and drink. They sleep\\r\\nwith their mouth open, breathe hard and snore. They have attacks of slight\\r\\nsuffocation sometimes, especially seen in young children. There may be\\r\\ndifficulty in nursing in infants; they sleep poorly, toss about in bed,\\r\\nmoan, talk, and night terrors are common.  They may also sweat very much\\r\\nduring sleep. A constant hacking or barking cough is a common symptom and\\r\\nthis cough is often troublesome for some hours before going to bed.\\r\\nTroubles with the larynx and pharynx are common and spasmodic laryngitis\\r\\nappears to be often dependent upon adenoids. Bronchial asthma and sneezing\\r\\nin paroxysms are sometimes connected with them. The chest becomes\\r\\ndeformed. The prolonged mouth-breathing imparts to adenoid patients a\\r\\ncharacteristic look in the face. The lower jaw is dropped and the lips are\\r\\nkept constantly apart. In many cases the upper lip is short, showing some\\r\\npart of the upper teeth. The dropping of the jaw draws upon the soft parts\\r\\nand tends to obliterate the natural folds of the face about the nose,\\r\\nlips, and cheeks. The face has an elongated appearance and the expression\\r\\nis vacant, listless, or even stupid. The nose is narrow and pinched, from\\r\\nlong continued inaction of the wings of the nose (alae nasi). The root of\\r\\nthe nose may be flat and broad. When the disease sets in during early\\r\\nchildhood, the palate may become high arched. If the disease continues\\r\\nbeyond second teething, the arch of the palate becomes higher and the top\\r\\nof the arch more pointed. The upper jaw elongates and this often causes\\r\\nthe front teeth to project far beyond the corresponding teeth in the lower\\r\\njaw. The high arched palate is often observed to be associated with a\\r\\ndeflected partition (septum) in the nose.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe speech is affected in a characteristic way; it acquires a dead\\r\\ncharacter. There is inability to pronounce the nasal consonant sounds; m,\\r\\nn, and ng and the l, r, and th sounds are changed. Some backwardness in\\r\\nlearning to articulate is often noticed.\\r\\n\\r\\nDeafness is frequently present, varying in degree, transient and\\r\\npersistent. Attacks of earache are common and also running of the ears.\\r\\nThe ear troubles often arise from the extension of catarrh from the\\r\\nnose-pharynx through the eustachian tubes to the middle ear. Sometimes the\\r\\nadenoids block the entrance to the tubes. The ventilation of the middle\\r\\near may be impeded. Dr. Ball, of London, England, says: \"Ear troubles in\\r\\nchildren are undoubtedly, in the vast majority of cases, dependent upon\\r\\nthe presence of adenoid vegetation\" (growths).\\r\\n\\r\\nChildren with adenoids are very liable to colds in the head, which\\r\\naggravate all the symptoms, and in the slighter forms of the disease the\\r\\nsymptoms may hardly be noticeable, except when the child is suffering from\\r\\na cold.\\r\\n\\r\\n[10 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nChronic catarrh is often caused by adenoids. A chronic pus discharge often\\r\\ndevelops, especially in children. There is often a half-pus discharge\\r\\ntrickling over the posterior wall of the pharynx from the nose-pharynx.\\r\\nAnd yet some children with adenoids never have any discharge from the\\r\\nnose. There may be more or less dribbling of saliva from the mouth,\\r\\nespecially in young children, and this is usually worse during sleep.\\r\\nHeadache is not uncommon when these growths persist into adult life: they\\r\\ncontinue to give rise to most of the symptoms just described, although\\r\\nthese symptoms may be less marked because of the relatively larger size of\\r\\nthe nose-pharynx. The older patients seek relief, usually, from nasal\\r\\ncatarrh symptoms. They complain of a dry throat on waking and they hawk\\r\\nand cough, In order to clear the sticky secretion from the throat. The\\r\\nadenoids have often undergone a considerable amount of shrinking, but they\\r\\nfrequently give rise to a troublesome inflammation of the nose and\\r\\npharynx. Rounded or irregular red elevations will often be seen on the\\r\\nposterior wall of the pharynx, outgrowths of adenoid tissue in this\\r\\nregion. Similar elevations are sometimes seen on the posterior pillars of\\r\\nthe fauces. The tonsils are often enlarged. A good deal of thick discharge\\r\\nwill sometimes be seen in the posterior wall of the pharynx proceeding\\r\\nfrom the nose-pharynx.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough adenoids, like the normal tonsil, usually tend to diminish and\\r\\ndisappear with the approach of youth, they constitute during childhood a\\r\\nconstant source of danger and trouble and not infrequently inflict\\r\\npermanent mischief. Also children afflicted with adenoids are less able to\\r\\ncope with diphtheria, scarlet fever, measles, whooping-cough, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nDeafness, mouth-breathing habit, and imperfect resonance of the voice, as\\r\\nwell as the characteristic expression of the face, will often remain as\\r\\npermanent effects of the impairment of function due to these growths in\\r\\nchildhood, even though they have more or less completely disappeared. The\\r\\ncollapsed state of the wings of the nose, and wasted condition of their\\r\\nmuscles, resulting from long disease, often contributes to the\\r\\nperpetuation of the mouth-breathing habit. On the other hand the rapid\\r\\nimprovement, after a timely removal of the growths, is usually very\\r\\nstriking.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--The only thing to do is to remove them soon, no matter how\\r\\nyoung the patient may be. An anaesthetic is usually given to children. The\\r\\noperation does not take long and the patient soon recovers from its\\r\\neffects. The result of an operation, especially in young children, is\\r\\nusually very satisfactory. Breathing through the nose is re-established,\\r\\nthe face expression is changed for the better. The symptoms as before\\r\\ndescribed disappear to a great extent.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCOLDS. (Coryza. Acute Nasal Catarrh. Acute Rhinitis).--This is an\\r\\ninflammation of the mucous membrane lining the nose.\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses.--Exposure to cold or wet when the body is overheated; sudden or\\r\\nextreme changes in the atmosphere; inhaling irritating fumes or dust.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--A chilly feeling, limbs ache, tendency to sneeze, severe\\r\\nheadache above the nose, eyes are dry, stopped-up feeling in the nostrils.\\r\\nThen there is a thin watery discharge, usually of an irritating character,\\r\\nvery thin at first, but it soon becomes thicker; sometimes the ears ring\\r\\n(tinnitus). The nose and lining is red and swollen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMOTHERS\\' REMEDIES.--1. Colds. Borax for Cold Settled in Throat. \"For a\\r\\ncold in the throat, dissolve a piece of borax, the size of a pea, in the\\r\\nmouth and don\\'t talk. It will work like a charm.\" This is an old and well\\r\\ntried remedy and is very good for colds or sore throat. It acts by\\r\\ncontracting the tissues and in that way there is less congestion in the\\r\\nparts.\\r\\n\\r\\n[RESPIRATORY DISEASES 11]\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Colds, Valuable Caution and Treatment for.--Mrs. Maxwell, of Cleveland,\\r\\nwrites in the Cleveland Press as follows: \"If you intend to treat the cold\\r\\nyourself, take it up at the outset. Don\\'t wait for it to develop. To break\\r\\nit up, nothing is better than the full hot bath at bed time, or the foot\\r\\nbath with mustard, followed by a hot drink. It is old-fashioned, but\\r\\nscientific, for nine colds out of ten are due to clogged pores. Benjamin\\r\\nFranklin said a hundred years ago that all colds come from impure air,\\r\\nlack of exercise, and over-eating, and nobody has ever bettered his\\r\\nconclusion. Even contagious colds will not be taken if the bodily\\r\\nresistance is kept at par. More fresh air, less grip. Avoid people who\\r\\nhave colds, and keep out of badly ventilated rooms. Stuffy street cars are\\r\\nresponsible for half the hard colds, not because people get chilled, but\\r\\nbecause the air is foul. And when you have a cold keep away from the baby.\\r\\nIf the baby takes a cold, let it have medical attention at once. Don\\'t\\r\\nexperiment upon it with remedies intended for grown-ups.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Colds, Molasses-Vinegar Syrup for.--\"One-half cup of molasses, butter\\r\\nthe size of a hickory nut, one tablespoon vinegar, boil together. Dose:\\r\\nOne teaspoonful or less as the case requires. Take often until relieved.\"\\r\\nThis is an old remedy and a good one.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Colds, Quinine and Ginger for.--\"Give plenty of quinine and drink hot\\r\\nwater with ginger in it.\" Quinine, as we all know, is an old remedy for\\r\\ncolds and therefore we all know how it acts. The ginger warms up the\\r\\nsystem and produces sweating. Care should be taken when using this remedy\\r\\nnot to take cold, as the pores are all opened by the quinine.\\r\\n\\r\\n5. Colds, Boneset for.--\"Boneset tea steeped and drank cold cures a\\r\\ncold.\" Boneset simply acts by causing a better circulation in the system\\r\\nand in that way sweating is produced and we all know that a good sweat\\r\\nwill usually cure a cold if taken in time.\\r\\n\\r\\n6. Severe Cold or Threatened Consumption.--\"One pint of molasses; one pint\\r\\nof vinegar; three tablespoonfuls of white pine tar; let this boil not\\r\\nquite half down; remove from the stove and let stand until next day; then\\r\\ntake and skim tar off from the top, throwing tar away. Jar up and take as\\r\\noften as necessary. Spoonful every half to two hours.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n7. Colds, Rock Candy Syrup for.--\"Ten cents worth of rock candy; one pint\\r\\nof whisky; one pint of water; fifteen cents worth of glycerine; mix all\\r\\ntogether; this will syrup itself.\" Take one teaspoonful as often as\\r\\nnecessary. This is excellent.\\r\\n\\r\\n8. Colds, Skunk\\'s Oil for.--\"Skunk\\'s oil has cured colds quickly by\\r\\nrubbing on chest and throat.\" The oil penetrates quickly and relieves the\\r\\ncongestion. This remedy can always be relied upon.\\r\\n\\r\\n[12 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\n9. Colds, Lemons and Mustard for.--\"A hot lemonade taken on going to bed\\r\\nand put the feet in a hot mustard bath; taken in time will break up a\\r\\ncold.\" The idea of the foot bath is to equalize the circulation, as so\\r\\nmany of our colds begin in the head and by drawing the blood from the head\\r\\nthe congested parts of the head are relieved.\\r\\n\\r\\n10. Colds and Cough, Hops or Catnip Poultice for.--\"Hops or catnip put in\\r\\nlittle bags and steamed until hot, then placed on lungs and throat.\" This\\r\\nis a very good remedy, as the hot bags act as a poultice and draw the\\r\\ncongestion from the diseased parts. It produces not only local, but\\r\\ngeneral perspiration.\\r\\n\\r\\n11. Colds, Honey for.--\"Eat honey. I have tried this many times and it is\\r\\nvery good.\" The honey is very soothing, but if a little hoarhound or lemon\\r\\nis added it would make it much more effective. This is a good remedy for\\r\\nchildren, as they most all like honey.\\r\\n\\r\\n12. Colds, to Break Up at the Outset.--\"To break up a cold soak the feet\\r\\nin hot water and drink all the cold water you can.\" This has been known to\\r\\ncure many severe colds if taken at the beginning.\\r\\n\\r\\n13. Cold in the Chest, Mutton Tallow and Red Pepper for.--\"If cold is in\\r\\nthe chest, render enough mutton tallow for one cupful and add one\\r\\nteaspoonful of red pepper and rub on chest and apply a flannel to keep out\\r\\nthe cold. This is an old-time remedy and a good one.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n14. Colds, Lard and Turpentine for.--\"Melt a half cupful of lard and add\\r\\none and one-half teaspoonfuls of turpentine, rub on chest and apply\\r\\nflannel cloth.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n15. Cold, Milk and Cayenne as a Preventive.--\"Drink a glass of milk with a\\r\\npinch of cayenne in it. This will warm the stomach and prevent headache.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPHYSICIANS\\' TREATMENT for Colds.--Preventive. Avoid the known causes of\\r\\nthe trouble. A daily cold bath, if well borne, is held to be an effectual\\r\\nprevention against taking cold. Have the adenoids removed if your\\r\\nphysician so recommends it. If seen early it can frequently be aborted.\\r\\nBathe the feet in hot mustard water, a small handful of mustard to a pail\\r\\nhalf full of hot water. At the same time, drink hot teas, like hoarhound,\\r\\nginger, lemonade, etc. Then put the patient to bed and place hot water\\r\\nfruit jars around him. This treatment will produce a good sweat. After the\\r\\nsweating has continued for some time and the patient feels uncomfortable\\r\\nbecause of the sweat, bathe him with a towel dipped in warm water, and dry\\r\\nthe parts as you go along. Of course, all of this is done under cover.\\r\\nAfter you have bathed and dried the patient, put on a clean and well-aired\\r\\nnight shirt and clean sheets, also well aired. This simple treatment will\\r\\nabort most colds. The patient should keep in bed for at least twelve hours\\r\\nafter such a sweating. Plenty of cold water and lemonade can be given,\\r\\nespecially after the patient has become cooler. Plenty of water is good\\r\\nfor any cold; hot outside and cool for the inside. The bowels should be\\r\\nopened with salts. A Dover\\'s powder (ten grains) will produce sweating,\\r\\nbut why use it when sweating can be produced by the means first mentioned.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[RESPIRATORY DISEASES 13]\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Camphor and Vaseline Mixed, or Camphor and Cream, rubbed in the nose is\\r\\ngood to stop the cold and soreness.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. A few drops (two or three) of camphor taken internally every three\\r\\nhours will abort some colds, especially if the nose is all the time\\r\\npouring out drops of water.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Aconite in small doses, one-tenth of a drop, every two hours is a\\r\\nsplendid remedy at the beginning. My experience has shown me that aconite\\r\\ndoes better work in these small doses. Put one drop in ten teaspoonfuls of\\r\\nwater and give one teaspoonful at a dose.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. The following is good for a thick discharge: in oil spray.\\r\\n\\r\\nMenthol            6 grains\\r\\nChloroform         5 drops\\r\\nCamphor            5 grains\\r\\nLiquid Alboline    2 ounces\\r\\n\\r\\nMix and make into a solution. Use in an atomizer, every two hours.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo cleanse the nostrils wash out each nostril gently with a solution made\\r\\nof one teaspoonful of listerine, or glyco-thymoline, or borolyptol, or\\r\\none-quarter teaspoonful of common salt in a half glass of warm water.\\r\\nYou can use a vaporizer and this solution:\\r\\n\\r\\nMenthol                      5 grains\\r\\nCamphor                      5 grains\\r\\nCompound tincture benzoin    1 dram\\r\\nLiquid Alboline              1 ounce\\r\\n\\r\\nMix and make solution and use frequently in a nebulizer.\\r\\n\\r\\nNever snuff a solution into the nose, and do not blow the nose hard after\\r\\nusing. Some of the solution or nasal discharge may be forced into the\\r\\neustachian tube.\\r\\n\\r\\n5. Lard or camphorated oil rubbed on the nose and throat twice a day is\\r\\ngood.\\r\\n\\r\\n6. To Restore the Loss of the Voice.--\\r\\n\\r\\nOil of wintergreen       2 drams\\r\\nLanolin or vaseline      1 ounce\\r\\n\\r\\nMix and rub on the throat at night and put on flannel until morning. This\\r\\nwill relieve the loss of voice very promptly.\\r\\n\\r\\n7. Put a quart of boiling water in a pitcher; add from two to four drams\\r\\nof the compound tincture of benzoin and inhale the hot vapor. Wrap both\\r\\nhead and pitcher in a towel. This is very good for sore throat also.\\r\\n\\r\\n8. Herb Teas for.--Ginger tea, catnip, hoarhound, pennyroyal, etc.; hot,\\r\\nare all good to produce sweating and thus relieve cold.\\r\\n\\r\\n9. From Dr. Ball, a London, England, Specialist.--\\r\\n\\r\\nMenthol                    30 grains\\r\\nEucalyptol                 30 drops\\r\\nCarbolic acid               2 drams\\r\\nRectified spirits of wine   1 dram\\r\\n\\r\\nMix thoroughly; a teaspoonful to be put into a pint (or less) of hot water\\r\\nand the steam to be inhaled through the nose for four or five minutes.\\r\\nThis is useful in acute colds, especially in the later stages, and in\\r\\nchronic catarrh, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\n[14 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\n10. When the stage is rather marked or prolonged spray or syringe out the\\r\\nnose with tepid solution once or twice a day using the following:\\r\\n\\r\\nBicarbonate of soda   3 to 5 grains\\r\\nBorax                 3 to 5 grains\\r\\nTepid water           1 ounce\\r\\n\\r\\nUse a spray, douche, or gargle in chronic catarrh and chronic pharyngitis.\\r\\nWhen you wish to use a large quantity, mix an equal quantity each of soda\\r\\nand borax and put a couple teaspoonfuls to each pint of warm water and\\r\\nuse.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCATARRH. (Chronic Inflammation of the Nose, Chronic Rhinitis). Causes.--\\r\\nFrequent attacks of colds, irritating gases and dust, adenoids, enlarged\\r\\ntonsils, spurs on the septum (partition bone) or foreign bodies in the\\r\\nnose, like corn, beans, stone, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms and Course.--There are alterations of the secretions: the amount\\r\\nvaries in the same case at different times. Sometimes it is thin and\\r\\nwatery, or thick, sticky mucus or this may alternate with more watery\\r\\ndischarges. It may be mucus and pus or entirely pus. Frequently the\\r\\nsecretions discharge into the throat and cause efforts to clear it by\\r\\nhawking and spitting. The secretion sometimes dries and forms crusts in\\r\\nthe fore part of the turbinated bones and partition. Patients frequently\\r\\npick the nose for this crust and ulceration may result at that point from\\r\\nits doing. Bleeding often occurs from picking the scales from the ulcers,\\r\\nand perforation of the partition may take place from extension of the\\r\\nulceration. There is a feeling of stuffiness. There is some obstruction to\\r\\nbreathing. If there is much thickness of the structures, nasal obstruction\\r\\nis a persistent symptom. Changed voice, mouth-breathing, etc., are\\r\\nnoticed. A sensation of pain or weight across the bridge of the nose is\\r\\nsometimes complained of and this symptom is especially found associated\\r\\nwith enlargement of the middle turbinated body on one or both sides, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nMOTHERS\\' REMEDIES. 1. Catarrh, Successful remedy for.--- \"Dissolve in\\r\\none-half ounce olive oil as much camphor gum as it will take up. Moisten a\\r\\nlittle finger with the oil, rub into the nostrils and snuff well up into\\r\\nthe head.\" The olive oil is very soothing to the diseased parts and the\\r\\ncamphor contracts the swollen mucous membranes, thereby relieving the\\r\\ncatarrh. This is an excellent remedy.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Catarrh, Cleansing Antiseptic Remedy for.--\"Snuff about one teaspoonful\\r\\nof salt in cup of warm water every morning in nostrils. I have found this\\r\\nremedy simple but fine for catarrh and also having sleeping room well\\r\\nventilated summer and winter will help in curing disease.\" This remedy\\r\\nwill be found very effective in catarrh because it loosens up the\\r\\nsecretions and cleanses the nose of the foul secretions and also has an\\r\\nantiseptic action. This can be used twice daily. Snuffing should be done\\r\\nvery gently so as not to draw the water too far back.\\r\\n\\r\\n[RESPIRATORY DISEASES 15]\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Catarrh, Witch-Hazel for.--\"Pond\\'s extract applied with nose spray.\"\\r\\nPond\\'s extract is simply witch-hazel water and everyone knows that\\r\\nwitch-hazel water is healing and soothing to the membranes of the nose.\\r\\nThis may be used regularly twice a day.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Catarrh, Cure for.--\\r\\n\\r\\nMenthol          10 grains\\r\\nCamphor Gum      10 grains\\r\\nChloroform       10 drops\\r\\nFluid Alboline    8 ounces\\r\\n\\r\\nMix. Apply in the nasal cavities with alboline atomizer.\\r\\n\\r\\n5. Catarrh of head, Mullein Leaves. Treatment, etc., for.--\"Smoke dried\\r\\nmullein leaves and blow the smoke through the nose, and in addition to\\r\\nthis, put a heaping tablespoonful of powdered borax in a quart of soft\\r\\nwater; syringe this up in the nose, and in addition to both of the above,\\r\\nfrequently inhale a mixture of two drams of spirits of ammonia, half a\\r\\ndram tincture of iodine and fifteen drops of carbolic acid; smoke the\\r\\nmullein, syringe the borax water and inhale the last mixture all as\\r\\nfrequently as convenient and it frequently will cure if kept up\\r\\nfaithfully.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n6. Catarrh, Milk and Salt Wash for.--\"Mix together one teaspoonful common\\r\\nsalt, a teacupful milk, and half pint of warm water. Inject this into the\\r\\nnostrils three times a day. You may use the same quantity of borax in\\r\\nplace of the salt, if you choose to do so.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPHYSICIANS\\' TREATMENT for Catarrh.--If the patient is run down, give\\r\\ntonics, plenty of fresh air and sunshine in the sleeping room, change of\\r\\nclimate to a dry, unchangeable climate is sometimes necessary.\\r\\n\\r\\nLocal.--Attend to any disturbing cause, such as adenoids, spurs on the\\r\\npartition, turbinate bone, etc. It is first necessary to render the parts\\r\\nclean, through the use of some mild antiseptic solution, such as\\r\\nglyco-thymoline, listerine, borolyptol, salt, etc. Salt should not be used\\r\\nstronger than one-quarter teaspoonful in a glass half full of water. The\\r\\nothers can be used in one to two teaspoonfuls, to same amount of warm\\r\\nwater. The solution should always be mild and warm. To use any solution\\r\\npour it gently through the nose, tilting the head backward, with the mouth\\r\\nopen; then as the solution flows through the head should be put forward\\r\\nand downward. The solution flows out of the mouth, and also out of the\\r\\nother nostril. A nasal douche cup made purposely should be used if\\r\\npossible.\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Spray for.--After cleansing the nostrils with the solution the\\r\\nfollowing soothing mild spray will be found of great benefit.\\r\\n\\r\\nMenthol           5 grains\\r\\nCamphor           5 grains\\r\\nLiquid Alboline   2 ounces\\r\\n\\r\\nMix and make a solution. Use in an atomizer or nebulizer.\\r\\n\\r\\n[16 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Powders for.--Antiseptic powders are also very useful in some cases,\\r\\nsuch as, compound stearate of zinc and boric acid, or compound stearate of\\r\\nzinc and alum or compound stearate of zinc and menthol. One or two drams\\r\\nis enough to buy at once as it is very light; always use it in a powder in\\r\\nthe following way:\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst take a long breath and while holding the breath, puff some of the\\r\\npowder into each nostril; then gently puff the breath out through each\\r\\nnostril. Do not snuff powder up the nose or use the powder-blower while\\r\\nbreathing. If this is done, some will get into the pharynx and larynx and\\r\\ncause annoying coughing.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Solution for.--\\r\\n\\r\\nBicarbonate of soda  1/2 ounce\\r\\nBorax                1/2 ounce\\r\\nSalt                 1/2 ounce\\r\\nWhite sugar            1 ounce\\r\\n\\r\\nMix all. Half a teaspoonful to be dissolved in one-half tumbler of warm\\r\\nwater; used with spray producer or a syringe.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Spray, for.--\\r\\n\\r\\nBicarbonate of soda  1-1/2 drams\\r\\nListerine                6 drams\\r\\nWater                    1 ounce\\r\\n\\r\\nUse as a spray.\\r\\n\\r\\nOZENA.--(Foul odor from nose, not breath, due to catarrh of the nose). The\\r\\nmembrane is dry and shrunken. It is a very offensive odor, thus called\\r\\n\"ozena.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses.--It is usually seen in people who are very much debilitated, in\\r\\nyoung factory girls, and sometimes in healthy boys. Retained secretions in\\r\\nthe nose, usually cause the odor. These decompose and ferment. The nose is\\r\\nlarge and roomy, the nostrils are filled with scabby secretions; hard\\r\\nmasses are formed which sometimes fill the nostril.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPHYSICIANS\\' TREATMENT.--The first few weeks, cleansing the nose with\\r\\nperoxide of hydrogen will stop the odor. First, remove the scabs with\\r\\nforceps and then wash and cleanse the nose with the peroxide solution. It\\r\\ncan be used from one-quarter strength to full strength, but warm. This\\r\\nwill leave the nose in a foamy, soapy condition and this can be cleansed\\r\\nwith a mild solution of glyco-thymoline or salt water.\\r\\n\\r\\nHOME TREATMENT.--This is very important. The patient should use a douche\\r\\nthree or four times a day. In the solution glyco-thymoline or borolyptol\\r\\none or two teaspoonfuls to one-half cup of warm water, and follow by a\\r\\nnebulizer or atomizer in which the following solution can be used:\\r\\n\\r\\n1.    Lysol             10 drops\\r\\n      Oil of Pine       15 drops\\r\\n      Liquid Alboline    2 ounces\\r\\n\\r\\nMix and make a solution, spray into the nose after douching.\\r\\n\\r\\n[RESPIRATORY DISEASES 17]\\r\\n\\r\\n2. The following ointment can be used if there is no atomizer or nebulizer\\r\\nat hand:\\r\\n\\r\\nIodol        5 grains\\r\\nBoric Acid  10 grains\\r\\nCold cream   2 ounces\\r\\n\\r\\nMix and make into an ointment, and rub a little into each nostril before\\r\\nretiring.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Dr. Ferguson of New York uses the following: A new antiseptic enzymol.\\r\\nThis is used as follows.--Use one part of enzymol, three parts of warm\\r\\nwater. Rub and cleanse the nose thoroughly with the solution, saturate a\\r\\npiece of absorbent cotton with this solution, place it in the nostril and\\r\\nleave it there fifteen to twenty minutes.\\r\\n\\r\\nHAY FEVER. (Rose Cold, June Cold or Hay Asthma).--This inflammation of the\\r\\nnose occurs in August and September. It is really a nervous affection of\\r\\nthe nose membrane.\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses.--A predisposition: A peculiar sensitive area in the mucous\\r\\nmembrane of the nose. An exciting cause circulating in the air, the dust\\r\\nor pollen of certain plants, such as rag-weed, hay and barley; the odor of\\r\\ncertain flowers, such as roses and golden rod; dust of some drugs as\\r\\nipecac and benzoic acid; the odor of some animals. It usually comes about\\r\\nthe same date each year, growing worse each year and, in time, affects the\\r\\nbronchial tubes.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--The earliest symptoms are, usually, an itching sensation in the\\r\\nroof of the mouth and the palate, or itching and burning at the inner\\r\\ncorner of the eyes. Irritation within the nose is also experienced and\\r\\nvery soon spells of sneezing set in. The nose soon feels stuffy and\\r\\nobstructed, and there is a clear water discharge from the nose, which is\\r\\nespecially copious after sneezing. The eyes look red and watery and the\\r\\neyeballs pain and there is also pain in the forehead above the nose. It\\r\\nmay take several days to develop these symptoms. They are usually worse in\\r\\nthe morning. After some days these symptoms become more persistent and\\r\\nsevere. The nostrils are completely closed, and the patient must breathe\\r\\nthrough the mouth, and the spells of sneezing are very violent. The\\r\\nconjunctiva becomes congested and red, a profuse watery discharge runs\\r\\nfrom the eyes and the lids are swollen. In severe cases the face looks red\\r\\nand swollen. The mucous membrane of the mouth, pharynx and tonsils is more\\r\\nor less reddened and irritated, smell and taste are impaired and sometimes\\r\\nthe patient is slightly deaf. The patient feels tired, weak, and it is\\r\\nhard to study or do manual labor. Slight feelings of chillness are common.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMOTHERS\\' REMEDIES. 1. Hay fever, Quick Relief from.--\"For hay fever and\\r\\nother slight forms of diseases which produce sneezing, there is no remedy\\r\\nmore quickly effective, and often curative, than a vapor of heated salt\\r\\nand alcohol. Heat it very hot and breathe the vapor for ten minutes at a\\r\\ntime, four or five times a day.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Hay fever, Remedy Worth Trying for.--\"A mixture composed of ten grains\\r\\nof sulphate of zinc, half teaspoonful of borax, and about four ounces of\\r\\nrose water. This is very good to inject into the nostrils if there is much\\r\\nirritation of eyes and nostrils.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n[18 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Hay fever, Our Canadian Remedy for.--\"Inhale smoke from ground coffee\\r\\n(sprinkle over coals). This relieved a case for me of five years\\r\\nstanding.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Hay Fever, Medicine That Helps.--\"Use phenol sodique as directed on the\\r\\nbottles. This was recommended to me by Mrs. Levi Weller, who said her\\r\\nhusband had found more relief from this remedy than any other he had\\r\\ntried.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPHYSICIANS\\' TREATMENT for Hay Fever.--1. The following gives relief from\\r\\nthe distressing symptoms. (But first the nose should be examined, for\\r\\noften there is local trouble there.). Then give suprarenal extract\\r\\ntablets, each five grains. Take one every four or five hours.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Pill Blennostasin.--Each pill contains five grains. Take one every four\\r\\nhours.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. The following solution gives temporary relief:--\\r\\n\\r\\nDionin                 10 grains\\r\\nAdrenalin (1 to 1000)   5 drams\\r\\nWater                   2 ounces\\r\\n\\r\\nMix solution and spray into the nose every two hours.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. After using the above spray which will shrink the mucous membrane apply\\r\\nthe following oil spray:--\\r\\n\\r\\nThymol            5 grains\\r\\nMenthol           5 grains\\r\\nCamphor           5 grains\\r\\nLiquid Alboline   1 ounce\\r\\n\\r\\nMix and make a solution and spray into the nose three or four times a day.\\r\\n\\r\\n5. In some cases a drying powder does well, such as compound stearate of\\r\\nzinc and alum one dram; puff it into the nose with a powder-blower every\\r\\nhour.\\r\\n\\r\\n6. Dr. Ball of London, England, gives the following.--A spray of a four\\r\\nper cent of cocaine, or direct application of cotton-wool soaked in a\\r\\nstronger solution will be found to afford immediate relief. But the after\\r\\neffect is likely to be bad. Hence menthol is a better application.\\r\\n\\r\\n[RESPIRATORY DISEASES  19]\\r\\n\\r\\n7. Another from Dr. Ball.--A one to five per cent solution of menthol in\\r\\nliquid paraffin may be painted or sprayed on the mucous membrane, or a\\r\\nlittle cotton-wool soaked in an oily solution may be inserted in the\\r\\nnostrils. We must confess our weakness as physicians, when we treat this\\r\\ndisease. There are local measures, such as give relief for the time being,\\r\\nbut they must be carefully used. Diseases of the nose, tumors or \"spurs\"\\r\\nfrequently cause in the first place; bad tonsils, and adenoids are likely\\r\\nto aggravate the trouble. A change of climate is the only real help. Tone\\r\\nthe general health. If the patient is very nervous fifteen grains of\\r\\nbromide of sodium three or four time a day gives relief. People subjected\\r\\nto hay fever should be treated between the attacks to make them strong and\\r\\nto remove any local nose trouble and just before the time of year arrives\\r\\nfor the attack it is well to take five grains three times a day of the\\r\\nsuprarenal tablets or blennostasin the same way, and also spray the nose\\r\\ntwice daily with a mild adrenalin solution as the following:-\\r\\nAdrenalin (1 to 1000)   1 dram\\r\\nWater                   2 ounces\\r\\nChange of climate is frequently quite beneficial. Some are relieved in the\\r\\ndry mountain air, while others are more benefited by the seashore or an\\r\\nocean trip.\\r\\n\\r\\nTUMOR OF THE NOSE.  (Nasal Polypus).--This tumor consists of a soft jelly-\\r\\nlike whitish growth, usually found in the upper front part of the nostril.\\r\\nIt may extend to the bottom (floor) of the nose, is quite soft and\\r\\nmoveable, being easy to push aside with a probe. The air passing through\\r\\nthe nostril will move it backward and forward. There may be one or several\\r\\nand they may completely fill the nostril. They sometimes grow from the\\r\\nback end of the middle turbinate bone, and gradually extend backward\\r\\nfilling up the back part of the nostril and even extending into the space\\r\\nbehind the nose and, if large, they may be seen below the soft palate.\\r\\n\\r\\nPHYSICIANS\\' TREATMENT.--The only thing to do is to remove them. This is\\r\\nusually done by a wire placed around the polypus and by the thumb-screw in\\r\\nthe instrument, tighten the wire until it has cut through the base.\\r\\n\\r\\nDEVIATION OF THE SEPTUM (Partition).--Deviation is the bending or curving\\r\\nof the partition (septum) to one side or the other, leaving one nostril\\r\\nvery large and roomy and closing the other nostril wholly or partly.\\r\\nCauses.--Blows, falls, etc., high-arch palate. It is seldom seen under\\r\\nseven years of age.\\r\\n\\r\\nPHYSICIANS\\' TREATMENT.--The treatment is to replace if possible, the part\\r\\nin the proper position. This requires an operation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNOSEBLEED. Mothers\\' Remedies.--1. Nosebleed; remedy sent us by a Public\\r\\nSchool Teacher.--\"Make a compress of paper soaked in cold water; put it\\r\\nunder the upper lip and have the patient press the lip with the fingers.\\r\\nRemarks.--Tried with success in many cases by a school teacher.\" By\\r\\nputting under the lip and pressing on it, you press on an artery and stop\\r\\nbleeding. Be careful to use nothing but white paper, as ink or colors\\r\\nwould come out when wet.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Nosebleed, Alum as a cure for.--\"Apply cold water to face and back of\\r\\nneck; snuff powdered alum.\" The powdered alum contracts the blood vessels,\\r\\nthereby shutting off the supply of blood. The cold water applied to the\\r\\nback of the neck affects the nervous system in such a manner that the\\r\\nblood vessels are contracted and so the blood supply is diminished.\\r\\n\\r\\n[20 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Nosebleed; Remedy that succeeded in a severe case.--\"Put pieces of ice\\r\\nin cloth. Lay a piece each side of the nose and on the back of the neck.\\r\\nRemarks.--My neighbor\\'s daughter had nosebleed which refused to stop until\\r\\nthey were much frightened but this treatment soon stopped it, after which\\r\\nshe rested quietly for a time,\"\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Nosebleed, Simple Remedy for.--\"Place the finger on the side of the\\r\\nnose tight for ten or fifteen minutes. My mother has stopped her nose from\\r\\nbleeding when other remedies failed.\" This shuts off the circulation and\\r\\nhelps to form a clot.\\r\\n\\r\\n5. Nosebleed, Another Home Remedy for.--\"Hold the head back as far as\\r\\npossible, press up the end of the nose with the end of the finger.\" Best\\r\\nto lie on the side so blood will not run down the throat and choke the\\r\\npatient.\\r\\n\\r\\n6. Nosebleed, Puff-Ball for.--\"Find an old brown puff-ball from the\\r\\nground, pick out the soft inside part and put it in nose and let remain\\r\\nfor some time.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n7. Nosebleed, Vinegar and Water for.--\"Wet a cloth in very cold water or\\r\\nstrong cold water and vinegar and apply to back of neck, renewing as it\\r\\ngets warm. Have seen this tried and know it to be good.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPHYSICIANS\\' TREATMENT for Nosebleed.--Place the patient on his side half\\r\\nlying, head and shoulders raised and apply a cold compress to the\\r\\nforehead, nose, and to the back of the neck. Press the end of the nose\\r\\nfirmly against the partition between the nostrils, for some minutes. This\\r\\npresses directly upon the bleeding point, as a rule. Also, when lying in\\r\\nthis position, the blood does not flow into the throat so readily. Raise\\r\\nthe arms above the head, apply cold to the spine or to the scrotum of men\\r\\nand breasts of women. Mustard foot baths are good, injection of cold\\r\\nwater, or the injection of hot water, 120 F., into the nostril will often\\r\\nhelp: Cold water, Or salt water, can be gently snuffed. Alum solution on a\\r\\ncloth put in the nostril often helps. A piece of bacon cut to bits and\\r\\nplaced in the nostril often stops it. Vinegar injected into the nostril is\\r\\ngood, or you can use a cloth saturated with vinegar and placed in the\\r\\nnostril. White oak bark tea, strong, is effective; juice of lemon applied\\r\\nsame way or injected is helpful.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow to plug the nostrils; (front or anterior nares).--Do this with narrow\\r\\nstrips of sterilized gauze, by placing the first piece as far back as\\r\\npossible, then with a narrow pair of forceps pushing in a little at a time\\r\\nuntil the nostril is filled. The gauze should be only one-half inch wide.\\r\\nIf the bleeding still continues the posterior opening (nares) should be\\r\\nplugged. This can be known by seeing the blood flowing down the throat\\r\\n(pharynx).\\r\\n\\r\\n[RESPIRATORY DISEASES 21]\\r\\n\\r\\nHow this is done? Pass a soft rubber catheter, along the floor (bottom) of\\r\\nthe nose until its end is seen passing down behind the soft palate into\\r\\nthe throat. Grasp this with a pair of forceps and pull it forward into the\\r\\nmouth. Tie a stout string to the end of the catheter (about 1-1/2 feet\\r\\nlong) and tie the other end of the string around the centre of a plug of\\r\\nlint or gauze, 1-1/2 inches long and three-quarters of an inch wide. Then\\r\\npull the catheter back through the nostril, very gently. This will pull\\r\\nthe plug into the posterior opening of the nose, and plug it. . Hold this\\r\\nsame end firmly and with a pair of forceps fill the anterior nostril with\\r\\nstrips (1/2 inch wide) of gauze, pushing them back to the posterior plug.\\r\\nThe end of the string in the mouth may be fastened to a tooth or to the\\r\\nside of the cheek (if long enough) with a piece of adhesive plaster. The\\r\\nplug should not be left in position more than forty-eight hours, and it\\r\\nshould be thoroughly softened with oil or vaselin before it is removed.\\r\\nRemove the anterior part first, gently and carefully and then with cocaine\\r\\n(if necessary) and more oil, the posterior plug is softened and removed by\\r\\npulling the end of the string which is in the mouth gently and slowly.\\r\\n\\r\\nSORE THROAT (Acute Pharyngitis--Acute Pharyngeal Catarrh--- Inflammation\\r\\nof the Pharynx--Simple Angina).--This is a common complaint especially\\r\\namong some adults. A predisposition to it is often due to chronic\\r\\npharyngitis, chronic enlargement of the tonsils and adenoids of the wall\\r\\nof the pharynx as well as chronic nasal obstruction. Rheumatic persons are\\r\\nespecially subject to it and acute articular rheumatism is often observed\\r\\nto be preceded by an attack of pharyngitis. Tonsilitis is said to have the\\r\\nsame influence also.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--The throat is dry and feels stiff. There may be tenderness at\\r\\nthe angle of the jaw and outside of the neck. Pains some to swallow. In a\\r\\nday or two there is a mucous secretion, making the patient inclined to\\r\\nclear the throat by hawking or coughing. The throat looks red and in the\\r\\nearly stage this is more noticeable on the anterior pillars of the fauces,\\r\\nthe soft palate and uvula. On the back wall you see bright red spots, the\\r\\ninflamed lymph follicles. It usually gets well in two to seven days. It\\r\\nmay become chronic after repeated acute attacks.\\r\\n\\r\\nChronic.--This is very common in persons who smoke or drink to excess,\\r\\nalso people who use their voice in public speaking as preachers do, or in\\r\\ncalling loudly as hucksters, railroad brakemen, stationmen, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrevention of chronic kind.--Ascertain the cause and remove it. Too hot\\r\\nfood or too much spiced food cause the chronic kind. Rest the voice.\\r\\nRemove any existing catarrh.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrevention of acute kind.--Avoid undue exposure to cold and wet, wear warm\\r\\ncomfortable flannel underwear. Bath the neck and chest daily with cold\\r\\nwater. This is good cold preventive. The wearing of handkerchiefs,\\r\\nmufflers, around the neck is injurious unless you are driving. Accustom\\r\\nyour neck to the cold from the beginning in the fall and winter months.\\r\\nWearing a full beard is said to be a good preventive.\\r\\n\\r\\nMOTHERS\\' REMEDIES.--1. Sore throat, Used for Years Successfully.--\"Salt\\r\\npork dipped in hot water then covered thick with black pepper. Heat in the\\r\\noven and lay or bind on the throat or lungs. This has been a favorite\\r\\nremedy with us for years.\" Sew the pork to a piece of cotton cloth and\\r\\nbind over the sore parts after you have sprinkled the pork with salt and\\r\\npepper. Leave this on as long as the patient can endure it. When the pork\\r\\nis removed, rub the affected parts with cold cream or vaselin and put a\\r\\nclean muslin cloth on to keep person from taking cold.\\r\\n\\r\\n[22  MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Sore throat, Splendid Liniment for.--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Olive oil    1/2 pint\\r\\nAmmonia       1/2 pint\\r\\nTurpentine    1/2 pint\\r\\nOne egg.\\r\\n\\r\\nShake till it forms emulsion. This can be used as a blister.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a very effective remedy, but you must watch the throat very\\r\\ncarefully as this will blister quickly. After removing the liniment,\\r\\ngrease the parts with oil or cold cream.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Sore throat, Simple Gargle for.--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Soda     1 teaspoonful\\r\\nSalt      1 teaspoonful\\r\\nBorax     1 teaspoonful\\r\\n\\r\\nDissolve in pint of warm water; use as a gargle frequently.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a very good gargle. It contracts the parts and acts as an\\r\\nantiseptic and thoroughly cleanses the parts.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Sore throat, Home Made salve for.-\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Beeswax      1 ounce\\r\\nRosin         1 ounce\\r\\nCamphor gum   1 ounce\\r\\nLard about the size of an egg.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMix the above ingredients together and apply to the outside of the throat.\\r\\nThis causes the skin to become red thus drawing the inflammation out of\\r\\nthe throat and relieving the trouble.\\r\\n\\r\\n5. Sore Throat, Cold Packs, Sure Cure for.--\"Put cold packs on the throat.\\r\\nRemarks: Was in Washington once and my little girl had a very sore throat.\\r\\nI put cold packs on the throat the first half of the night and the next\\r\\nday she was out seeing the sights as well as ever.\" Gargle with very hot\\r\\nwater and a little soda. This makes it very effective.\\r\\n\\r\\n6. Sore Throat, Ointment for.--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oil Turpentine      1/2 ounce\\r\\nOil of Hemlock       1/2 ounce\\r\\nOil of Peppermint    1/2 ounce\\r\\nOil of Encaliptus    1/2 ounce\\r\\n\\r\\nMix with one cup warm lard, apply warm to the throat.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n[RESPIRATORY DISEASES 23]\\r\\n\\r\\n7.

Tickling in Throat, Simple Remedy for.--\"Take bread crumbs and swallow\\r\\nthem.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPHYSICIANS\\' TREATMENT for Sore Throat.--1. Inhalation of steam either with\\r\\nor without medicine is good. (See treatment of tonsilitis-Inhaling steam)\\r\\nI treated a man once who had a terrific pharyngitis, All the parts were so\\r\\nterribly swollen, that he was unable to swallow or talk. I induced him to\\r\\ninhale steam from a teakettle. He was able to put his mouth over the spout\\r\\nof the kettle and he was relived in a few minutes. I think it saved his\\r\\nlife. I put no medicine in the water for that case. Very few persons can\\r\\ninhale the steam directly from the kettle. Other method is given under\\r\\ntonsilitis. A dose of salts at first is good. Remain in the house for a\\r\\nfew days.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Sulphur and Cream for.--Mix some sulphur with cream and put some of it\\r\\non the sore membrane.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Good Old Mother\\'s Remedy.--\"Steep a medium sized red pepper in one-half\\r\\npint of water, strain and add one-fourth pint of good vinegar and a\\r\\nheaping teaspoonful each of salt and powdered alum and gargle with it as\\r\\noften as needed. This is a very good remedy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n[24 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Physicians\\' Local Treatment.--A wet compress on the neck is useful at\\r\\nthe onset. Sucking ice or gargling with ice or cold water, or applying an\\r\\nice bag to the throat will be found useful.\\r\\n\\r\\nLater on, warm gargles and steam inhalation are more grateful. If there is\\r\\ngreat pain in swallowing, cocaine painted on the throat or sucking a\\r\\ncocaine lozenge before taking food will be found very useful.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. When the attack is mild medicine may not be needed. When there is fever\\r\\nand the throat is real sore, you can use one drop doses of tincture of\\r\\naconite every hour. This will frequently check it.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. I like the following at the beginning. Give tincture of aconite and\\r\\nmercury biniodide, called the pink tablet, alternately. Put ten drops of\\r\\nthe aconite in one-half glass of water and give from one-half to two\\r\\nteaspoonfuls everyone or two hours, alternating with one or two tablets of\\r\\none-hundred grain tablet of mercury biniodide. After the first twenty-four\\r\\nhours stop the acoite and give the mercury biniodide every three hours.\\r\\n\\r\\n4.

Inflammation of the Larynx. (Acute Laryngitis) Causes.--Due to\\r\\ntaking cold or over using the voice; hot liquids, poisons. It may occur in\\r\\ninfluenza and measles; from irritating gases; some are subject to it.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--Tickling in the larynx; cold air irritates, and breathing may\\r\\ncause some pain; dry cough; the voice may be altered. At first it may be\\r\\nonly husky. In children breathing may be very difficult, after a day or\\r\\ntwo there may be a light expectoration and finally there may be a loose\\r\\ncough and a slight fever. The trouble is in the region of \"Adam\\'s Apple.\"\\r\\nThere is little or no danger in these attacks if proper care is taken.

Rest of the voice and if the\\r\\ncase is severe keep in bed in a room with an even temperature and the air\\r\\nsaturated with moisture from a steaming teakettle, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. An ice bag on the throat or cold water cloths to the front of the\\r\\nthroat often give relief.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Tincture of Aconite.--This is given in the beginning when there is\\r\\nfever. The dose depends upon the age, and the amount of fever. You can\\r\\ngive it to a child by putting one drop of aconite in twelve teaspoonfuls\\r\\nof water and then give one teaspoonful every one to three hours according\\r\\nto the case. For an adult you can put ten drops of aconite in ten\\r\\nteaspoonfuls of water and give one teaspoonful every hour or two.\\r\\n\\r\\n4.

This process is called Tracheotomy.\\r\\n\\r\\nDiet in Laryngitis.--Hard and dry toasts should be avoided, for they give\\r\\npain on being swallowed, same reason applies to highly seasoned foods.\\r\\nMilk, custards, eggs, scraped beef may be taken. Difficulty in swallowing\\r\\nmay be overcome by allowing the patient to lie flat on the bed, etc., with\\r\\nhis face over the edge.

The\\r\\nbreathing is arrested, the child struggles for breath, the face is\\r\\nflushed, and then with a sudden relaxation of the spasm, the air is drawn\\r\\ninto the lungs with a high pitched crowing sound. Convulsions may occur.\\r\\nDeath rarely occurs. There may be many attacks during the day.\\r\\n\\r\\nPHYSICIANS\\' TREATMENT of Child Crowing. Preventive.--The gums should be\\r\\ncarefully examined and if they are swollen and hot they should be lanced.\\r\\nThe bowels should be carefully regulated, and as these children are\\r\\nusually of a delicate nature and afflicted with rickets, nourishing food\\r\\nand the treatment in diet and medicine should be given for rickets. Cod\\r\\nliver oil is a good general remedy. (See rickets).\\r\\n\\r\\nCold Sponging.--In severe cases, the child should be placed in a warm bath\\r\\ntub and the back and chest thoroughly sponged for a minute or two with\\r\\ncold water. This plan may be used even when a child is in a paroxysm,\\r\\nthough the attack is severe and the child looks blue, it is much better\\r\\nthan to dash cold water in the face. Sometimes the attack can be stopped\\r\\nby introducing the finger far back into the throat.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCROUP, Spasmodic.--This disease gives the parents a terrible shock if they\\r\\nhave never seen any attacks of the kind. The symptoms which attend the\\r\\nattack are out of all proportion to the real danger. It is generally the\\r\\nresult of exposure to cold or to the cold wind. Irritating, undigested\\r\\nfood, often causes it.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--Usually the child goes to bed perfectly well, or has a slight\\r\\ncold and wakes up an hour or two later, coughing and gasping for breath,\\r\\ndue to a spasm in the wind pipe. The cough is shrill, more like a bark;\\r\\nthe cough is repeated at intervals and soon the patient breathes quickly\\r\\nand laboriously. It must sit up for it can breathe easier sitting. The\\r\\nvoice is oftentimes nearly or quite lost, or at least only a hoarse\\r\\nwhisper; the face is bluish or perspiring. The spasm lasts for a variable\\r\\nperiod, but rarely exceeds one-half hour, sometimes only a few minutes.\\r\\nThe croupy cough and oppressed breathing may last longer than this, but\\r\\nthese too subside after a time, after which the child drops to sleep and\\r\\nusually rests quietly for the rest of the night. There is a tendency to\\r\\nrecurrence on succeeding night unless obviated by treatment.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment. Preventive.--Guard against such children\\'s exposure to cold\\r\\nwinds and dampness, dress them warmly. The living and sleeping rooms\\r\\nshould not be too warm. Do not give them food hard to digest at any time,\\r\\nespecially before bedtime. Foods hard to digest frequently cause the\\r\\nattack.\\r\\n\\r\\n[28 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nMOTHERS\\' REMEDIES. Croup, Cold Application for.--\"Apply to throat a\\r\\nflannel wrung out of cold water, lay a dry cloth over it.\" This is an\\r\\nexcellent remedy for a mother to try in case of an emergency when no other\\r\\nmedicine can be obtained. This very often will relieve a child until other\\r\\nremedies can be secured and has been known to save many children\\'s lives:\\r\\nThe cold water helps to draw the blood away from the larynx and air\\r\\npassages and also dilates the tubes and gives relief. Take great care not\\r\\nto wet the child, as this will cause it to take more cold and may prove\\r\\nfatal.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Croup, Sure Cure for.--\"Give child anything that will make it vomit,\\r\\nsoak feet in hot water, apply onion drafts to bottom of feet, roast onions\\r\\nand put on the chest, keep warm. My mother has cured me at least one\\r\\nhundred times with the above remedy. She generally gave me pig\\'s foot oil,\\r\\nor oil from the feet of a chicken, sometimes melted lard. Croup has to be\\r\\nattended to at once or it is fatal with the child.\" This is a very good\\r\\nremedy.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Croup, Immediate Relief from Steaming.--\"Put a small shawl over the\\r\\nchild\\'s head to retain steam, then put a small chunk of unslaked lime in a\\r\\nbowl of water under shawl. The steam affords immediate relief, usually, if\\r\\nchild inhales it.\" This is very good; shawl should cover the child\\'s head\\r\\nand bowl in which lime is dissolved.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Croup, for Baby or Older Child.--\"Take a teaspoonful alum, pulverize it\\r\\nand sprinkle it on the whites of two fresh eggs in a cup or glass, let it\\r\\nstand for a few minutes, until the combination has turned to water, or\\r\\nwater is produced; then give one-half teaspoonful to a child six months\\r\\nold or less and increase the dose to one teaspoonful for older children,\\r\\nand repeat the dose in fifteen or thirty minutes as the case may require.\\r\\nRemarks: From personal experience in my own and neighbors\\' families, I\\r\\nhave never known a case where it did not bring relief and cure. The dose\\r\\nmust produce vomiting.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n5. Croup, Remedy that Never Fails.--\"Two tablespoonfuls of liquor or\\r\\nbrandy and one-quarter teaspoonful of glycerin, one teaspoonful of sugar,\\r\\none tablespoonful of water; stir up well and give one teaspoonful every\\r\\nhour or oftener if necessary. Then at same time take a flannel and soak\\r\\nwell in cold water, wring it gently and put around neck with a heavy, dry\\r\\nflannel over the damp one. If damp flannel becomes hot take it off, dampen\\r\\nit in more cold water and apply again, and so on until relieved. Do not\\r\\nallow the patient to get chilled. Better results are obtained if patient\\r\\nwill go to bed. Remarks: I have used this in my family, and have always\\r\\nfound it to be the best croup cure I have ever seen, and it will be found\\r\\nto give immediate relief. The external application is extremely good.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n6. Croup, Coal Oil (kerosene) and Sugar for.--\"Coal oil and sugar; put a\\r\\nfew drops on a teaspoonful of sugar.\" The coal oil produces vomiting,\\r\\nrelieving the trouble. If the first dose does not have this effect upon\\r\\nthe child, repeat it.\\r\\n\\r\\n[RESPIRATORY DISEASES 29]\\r\\n\\r\\n7. Croup, Pork and Onion Poultice for.--\"Put pork and onions on the\\r\\nthroat. Drink plenty of hot water.\" Bind the pork and onions on the\\r\\nthroat, acting as a poultice. The virtue of this can be increased by\\r\\ncooking the onions and pork together. Onion syrup may be given internally\\r\\nto produce vomiting, even in very small babies.\\r\\n\\r\\n8. Croup, Bloodroot for.--\"One teaspoonful powdered bloodroot mixed with\\r\\nmolasses or sugar. Have taken this myself and it relieved at once. If one\\r\\ndose does not seem enough it may be repeated.\" This is a very effective\\r\\nremedy, but is very weakening. Care should be taken not to repeat dose any\\r\\noftener than absolutely necessary.\\r\\n\\r\\n9. Croup, Time Honored Remedy for.--\"Pulverized alum and sugar or honey or\\r\\nmolasses; mix together and give half teaspoonful doses or less. For\\r\\ninfants use only in emergency cases.\" This is one of the good\\r\\nold-fashioned remedies that nearly every mother has used. It acts simply\\r\\nby producing vomiting and causing the air tubes to relax. Repeat in five\\r\\nto twenty minutes until it causes vomiting.\\r\\n\\r\\n10. Croup, Ipecac for.--\"One-third teaspoonful of powdered ipecac\\r\\ndissolved in one teaspoonful of water, one tablespoonful of sugar; pour on\\r\\none teacupful of boiling water and let boil down to a half cup, Dose: One\\r\\nteaspoonful for adults; children in proportion every two hours; or, if\\r\\nneeded to vomit children give again in ten or fifteen minutes.\" If you\\r\\ncannot secure the powdered ipecac, the syrup can be bought at any drug\\r\\nstore, and is already prepared, Dose: Ten to fifteen drops as the case may\\r\\nneed.\\r\\n\\r\\n11. Croup, Vaselin for.--\"Vaselin rubbed on the chest, cover with a hot\\r\\nflannel, and take 1/4 teaspoonful of vaselin internally occasionally.\"\\r\\nDissolve vaselin and repeat dose if necessary to produce vomiting.\\r\\n\\r\\n12. Croup, Ice Application for.--\"Ice applied to the throat is almost\\r\\ninstant relief.\" It is best to break the ice up fine and sprinkle salt on\\r\\nsame, putting it in a cheese cloth bag, binding on the throat with a\\r\\nflannel, and change as soon as it shows signs of wetting.\\r\\n\\r\\n13. Croup, Salt for.--\"Parched salt put on the throat hot.\" The parched\\r\\nsalt acts the same as mustard plaster, by producing a redness on the\\r\\nthroat. Salt is something that we can always have on hand and by using\\r\\nthis remedy we are always prepared for an emergency in case of croup.\\r\\n\\r\\n14. Croup, Castor Oil Breaks up.--\"Castor oil, given before bedtime, is\\r\\ngood. Dose.--From one-half to one teaspoonful. I have taken this when I\\r\\nwas small.\" Castor oil is good when the bowels are constipated or the\\r\\nstomach is full.\\r\\n\\r\\n15. Croup, Coal Oil, Turpentine and Snuff, a Canadian Remedy for.--\"A\\r\\nlittle coal oil and a few drops of turpentine soaked up by snuff, and used\\r\\nas plaster. Makes the child sneeze after a few minutes. The poultice\\r\\nloosens the phlegm and the sneezing throws it off.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n[30 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nPHYSICIANS\\' TREATMENT for Croup.--Active. 1. Dr. Douglas says wring cloths\\r\\nout of cold water and apply very freely to the throat, and recommends the\\r\\nfollowing syrup:\\r\\n\\r\\nSyrup of Ipecac       3 fluid drams\\r\\nHive Syrup            4 fluid drams\\r\\nWater             1-1/2 ounces\\r\\n\\r\\nMix, and give one teaspoonful every half hour until the child vomits, then\\r\\nrepeat the dose every two hours as needed.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Place the child in a hot bath, wrap hot or cold cloths about the throat\\r\\nand put one teaspoonful of common soda in a glass of water and give one\\r\\nteaspoonful every fifteen minutes until relieved.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Dr. Holt of New York, says.--The room should be very warm, hot cloths\\r\\nor poultices should be applied over the throat (Adam\\'s apple and below)\\r\\nand either a croup kettle or ordinary teakettle kept boiling in the room.\\r\\nThis is more efficacious if the child is placed in a tent made by a raised\\r\\numbrella or some like method with a sheet thrown over it, and the steam\\r\\nintroduced beneath the tent. If the symptoms\\' are urgent ten drops of the\\r\\nsyrup of ipecac should be given every fifteen minutes until free vomiting\\r\\noccurs.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhenever the symptoms reach a point where the breathing becomes difficult,\\r\\na doctor should be summoned without delay. It might be some other disease.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Home Treatment.--One-half teaspoonful of alum mixed with molasses or\\r\\nhoney will produce vomiting and help. This is very good when the croup is\\r\\ndue to indigestion. At the same time, fry onions in lard and put them on\\r\\nthe neck in front, or hot wet cloths may do. The alum can be given once or\\r\\ntwice if necessary, half an hour apart, about in one-fourth or one-half\\r\\nthe first dose.\\r\\n\\r\\n5. Goose grease, or lard dissolved, and enough given to produce vomiting\\r\\nwill do good. This idea is not only to cause vomiting but to cause a sick\\r\\nfeeling after and at that time, which will cause the spasms to relax. A\\r\\nvery good thing to do in addition is to put the child\\'s feet in hot water,\\r\\nwhile local applications are put on the throat. These things tend to relax\\r\\nthe muscles and this relieves the spasm.\\r\\n\\r\\n6. Steam is Very Useful. It relaxes the spasm by local contact and by\\r\\nproducing general sweating. Cover the child\\'s head and a pitcher with a\\r\\nshawl and inhale the steam from the boiling water in pitcher. You can put\\r\\nin the pitcher one teaspoonful of oil of tar or one to two teaspoonfuls of\\r\\ntincture of benzoin. This can be kept up for some time.\\r\\n\\r\\nCOLD IN THE CHEST. (Acute Bronchitis. Inflammation of Bronchial Tubes).--\\r\\nThis is an acute inflammation of the larger and medium sized bronchial\\r\\ntubes.\\r\\n\\r\\n[RESPIRATORY DISEASES 31]\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses.--Youth and old age are more predisposed to it. Lack of fresh air\\r\\nand exercise, dusty work, poor general health, dampness and changeable\\r\\nweather in winter and early spring. It may be secondary to cold,\\r\\npharyngitis, measles, typhoid fever, malaria, asthma, and heart disease.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--There is a feeling of oppression with chilliness and pain in\\r\\nthe back, a dry, tight feeling beneath the breastbone with a dry harsh\\r\\ncough. This may cause headache and pain, and a raw feeling in the chest,\\r\\nchiefly in front. There may be a temperature of one hundred or one hundred\\r\\nthree or less. After a few days there is a thick, sticky secretion; it is\\r\\nprofuse. The other symptoms, except the cough, subside. This generally\\r\\nstops in ten days in a favorable case, or it may become chronic. In\\r\\ninfants or old people it may extend to the smaller tubes causing\\r\\nbroncho-pneumonia. There is more danger in infants than in older people.\\r\\n\\r\\nMOTHERS\\' REMEDIES. Bronchitis, Camphor and Lard for.--1. \"Grease a cloth\\r\\nwell with lard to which has been added some camphor gum, then sprinkle on\\r\\nsome dry baking soda and lay it on the chest. The camphor and lard should\\r\\nbe made into a salve, then put on the soda. The lard and camphor gum\\r\\npenetrates the affected parts, relieving the inflammation and tightness in\\r\\nthe chest. It is well in children to put a layer of cotton cloth over the\\r\\nchest keeping them warm and getting better results from the remedy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Bronchitis, Grandmother\\'s Remedy for.--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hoarhound          5 cents worth\\r\\nHops                5 cents worth\\r\\nWild cherry bark    5 cents worth\\r\\nLicorice root       5 cents worth\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Boil and simmer altogether in two quarts of water long enough to get the\\r\\nstrength out of the ingredients, strain, add three cups sugar, then add\\r\\nenough good whisky to keep from souring, say a half pint.\" This\\r\\ncombination is not only good for bronchitis, but for the cough left from\\r\\nthe effects of bronchitis. The hoarhound, wild cherry bark and licorice\\r\\nroot have a very soothing effect on the bronchial tubes, and the hops\\r\\nquiets the nervous system. This is also good for a common cough.\\r\\n\\r\\n[32 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Bronchitis, Antiphlogistine Plaster for.--\"Antiphlogistine is fine for\\r\\nbronchitis, where there is any inflammation, pleurisy, any kind of a\\r\\nscratch, especially rusty nails; pneumonia, Set can in water long enough\\r\\nto heat, but not hot, spread on with case knife as thick as a silver\\r\\ndollar, spread cotton batting over it, keep on twenty-four hours, before\\r\\nchanging. This is a very useful remedy to keep on hand.\" Antiphlogistine\\r\\nis very good to apply to the body wherever inflammation is present, as it\\r\\nwithdraws the blood from the organ or part of the body that is affected.\\r\\nIt does this by drawing the blood into the external circulation. It has\\r\\nthe same effect upon the diseased parts as the old-fashioned mustard, but\\r\\ndoes not blister. In using the mustard plaster you are in fear of\\r\\nblistering, and then having the outward blister and inward inflammation to\\r\\ncontend with. The antiphlogistine can be purchased at drug stores. Set the\\r\\ncan in warm water until it is warm, then spread on a piece of cotton cloth\\r\\nand apply to the affected parts, where it may remain for twenty-four\\r\\nhours, then repeat if necessary. Should always be put on warm, but not\\r\\nhot. It usually drops off when dry and no longer effective.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Bronchial, or any Severe Cough. One of the best Home Remedies.--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hoarhound (herb form)                1 ounce\\r\\nIrish moss                            1 ounce\\r\\nFlax Seed (the seed not pulverized)   1 ounce\\r\\nBoneset                               1 ounce\\r\\nLicorice Root (cut up fine)           1 ounce\\r\\n\\r\\nPlace the above in some suitable pan or dish for such purpose in a gallon\\r\\nof cold water, and put it on the back of the stove, so that it will simmer\\r\\nslowly until reduced to one-half gallon, which may require one day or\\r\\nmore, then strain and place in a bottle, or bottles. Dose.--One\\r\\nwineglassful three times a day. Add a little sugar if desired.\" This is a\\r\\nvery fine cough remedy, as the hoarhound loosens the cough, the flax seed\\r\\nsoothes the membrane, and the boneset by its general action on the system\\r\\nproduces sweating. The Irish moss is a sort of food for the whole system\\r\\nand helps to build a person up.\\r\\n\\r\\n5. Bronchitis, Camphorated Oil and Steaming for.--\"Bathe the chest and\\r\\nthroat up around the head with camphorated oil; drink water and steam the\\r\\nthroat and mouth over hot water. Have tried this recipe and found it\\r\\neffectual. Have a bronchial cough now and am treating it myself.\" The\\r\\ncamphorated oil seems to have a very soothing effect upon the chest, in\\r\\nfact it acts about the same as camphor and lard, only is more pleasant to\\r\\nuse, and can be bought already prepared. Drinking plenty of water cleanses\\r\\nthe system by acting upon the stomach, bowels and kidneys, carrying off\\r\\nthe impurities. The breathing of steam is very soothing and healing to the\\r\\nthroat and air passages.\\r\\n\\r\\n6. Bronchitis, General Relief for.--\"Dose of castor oil every night; one\\r\\nteaspoonful for child. Grease well with camphorated oil or any good oil.\"\\r\\nThe castor oil is very good for carrying off the phlegm from the stomach\\r\\nand bowels that children always swallow instead of coughing up like an\\r\\nolder person. It is well in addition to the above remedy to give a little\\r\\nlicorice or onion syrup to relieve the bronchial cough.\\r\\n\\r\\n7. Bronchitis, Lard Poultice for.--\"Take a piece of cotton batting large\\r\\nenough to cover chest and fit up close to the neck; wring out of melted\\r\\nlard as hot as the patient can stand it, and apply. Change as often as it\\r\\ngets cold. Also give dose of castor oil.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n8. Bronchitis, Mustard Plaster for.--\"Mustard plasters are very good.\"\\r\\nThis acts as a counter-irritant, as it draws the blood to the surface and\\r\\nrelieves the inflamed bronchial tubes.\\r\\n\\r\\n[RESPIRATORY DISEASES 33]\\r\\n\\r\\n9. Bronchitis, Well-Known Remedy for.--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Cod Liver Oil          2 ounces\\r\\nGinger Syrup            2 ounces\\r\\nMucilage of Gum Arabic  2 ounces\\r\\nOil of Cloves           6 drops\\r\\n\\r\\nDose :-Teaspoonful before meals and at bedtime.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a very good remedy, as the cod liver oil by its general action\\r\\ntones up the whole system. The ginger tones and stimulates the stomach and\\r\\ntakes away the sickening effect of the cod liver oil.\\r\\n\\r\\n10. Bronchitis Remedy and General Tonic.--\"Take small doses of glycerin\\r\\nand one teaspoonful three times a day of codfish oil.\" This remedy, though\\r\\nsimple, is very effective. The glycerin and codfish oil are both soothing\\r\\nto the affected parts, and the codfish oil is a very good tonic to tone up\\r\\nthe general system.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n1. PHYSICIANS\\' TREATMENT for Bronchitis. Sweating Remedy for.--Take a hot\\r\\nbath and then go to bed, and take hot drinks after. See that the bowels\\r\\nare open. Nourishment is especially important in infants and old age. You\\r\\ncan sweat them as directed under la grippe. Drink hot drinks, such as\\r\\nhoarhound, ginger, flaxseed, hot lemonade or slippery elm. These will\\r\\nproduce sweating and will give much relief. An onion poultice applied over\\r\\nthe breastbone where the pain and tightness are, will do good.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Steaming Remedy.--Inhaling steam from plain boiling water is good, or\\r\\nyou can add one to two teaspoonfuls of compound tincture of benzoin or\\r\\nturpentine. The steaming will be more effective if you make a tent, by\\r\\nfastening four sticks to the cradle or bed and cover with a sheet,\\r\\nintroducing the steam underneath this at the foot of the bed, etc. A\\r\\nrubber tube can be fastened to the kettle. In this same way you can\\r\\nproduce, if you wish, sweating by putting the end of the tube under the\\r\\nclothes elevated a little above the patient. Be careful not to scald the\\r\\npatient.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Steaming With Pitcher.--If the soreness of the bronchial tubes is not\\r\\nrelieved by this means, inhalations of steam arising from boiling water\\r\\nmay be practiced, either through a cone, one end of which covers the top\\r\\nof a pitcher, and the other end of which covers the mouth and nose of the\\r\\npatient, or by covering the head and pitcher with a towel. The usefulness\\r\\nof this method may be much increased by the addition of from two\\r\\nteaspoonfuls to one tablespoonful of compound tincture of benzoin to each\\r\\npint of water in a pitcher. This latter method can also be used in\\r\\ntonsilitis, pharyngitis and quinsy.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Rub the chest with a camphor liniment and give the following:\\r\\n\\r\\nTincture of Aconite       10 drops\\r\\nSweet Spirits of Nitre     2 drams\\r\\nDistilled water to make    4 ounces\\r\\n\\r\\nMix--One-half teaspoonful to a child, or dessert spoonful to an adult in\\r\\nwater every hour.\\r\\n\\r\\n[34 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\n5. For Adults.--Compound licorice mixture one to two drams every three to\\r\\nfour hours; or five grains of Dover\\'s powders every three to four hours.\\r\\n\\r\\nDiet in Bronchitis (similar to Laryngitis).--Drinks are useful in the\\r\\ndryer forms, such as hot flaxseed tea sweetened and flavored with lemon\\r\\njuice. It should be taken in large quantities. Hot milk and lemonade are\\r\\nalso useful.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHRONIC BRONCHITIS. Causes.--People over middle age are more liable to it.\\r\\nIt comes chiefly in winter, in changeable, cold and damp climates. It may\\r\\nfollow repeated acute attacks.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--These are variable and are present chiefly in winter and damp\\r\\nweather. The cough is worse at night, and in the morning, expectoration is\\r\\nusually great. There may be slight fever at times. Often the patients are\\r\\nentirely free from the trouble during the summer.\\r\\n\\r\\nPHYSICIANS\\' TREATMENT for Chronic Bronchitis. Preventive.--Warm equable\\r\\nclimate, such as southern California, Florida, or the south of France,\\r\\nespecially in the colder months; warm clothing, avoid exposure and\\r\\nfatigue.\\r\\n\\r\\n1. First you can take three grains of ammonium chloride three to four\\r\\ntimes a day.\\r\\n\\r\\n2.

If the cough is troublesome the following is good:\\r\\n\\r\\n    Ammonium Chloride                 2 drams\\r\\n    Hive Syrup                        4 drams\\r\\n    Fluid Extract Licorice            1 ounce\\r\\n    Paregoric                         6 drams\\r\\n    Distilled water enough to make    2 ounces\\r\\n\\r\\nMix. Teaspoonful every three to four hours.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUGHS. Causes.--There are many causes; inflammation of the larynx,\\r\\nbronchial tubes, lungs, also stomach and liver; and a nervous cough is\\r\\npresent in our day. Remove the cause when possible. There are many good\\r\\ncough medicines now put up, and they can be bought at any drug-store.\\r\\nCough lozenges of all kinds are plenty, and a sure cure is claimed by\\r\\neach.\\r\\n\\r\\nMOTHERS\\' REMEDIES.

Cough, Lemon Juice and Sugar for.--\"Lemon juice and sugar is a good\\r\\nremedy for coughs.\" It is surprising to see how quickly the lemon juice\\r\\nwill cut the phlegm in throat, and sugar is always good for cold.\\r\\n\\r\\n7. Cough, Standard Remedy for.--\\r\\n\\r\\n    \"Hoarhound         Five cents worth\\r\\n    Hops               Five cents worth\\r\\n    Wild cherry bark   Five cents worth\\r\\n    Licorice root      Five cents worth\\r\\n\\r\\nBoil or simmer altogether in two quarts of water long enough to get the\\r\\nstrength out of the ingredients; strain, add three cups sugar.

Exciting causes are change of climate and residence, dust, smoke,\\r\\nodors, errors in diet, emotion, and cold.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--The onset is often sudden, often during the night. Difficulty\\r\\nof breathing is intense. The patient cannot lie down, but often sits at an\\r\\nopen window, resting the elbows on a table. The face is pale and the\\r\\nexpression is anxious. There is a feeling of great oppression in the chest\\r\\nand often dread of suffocation. Respiration (breathing) though labored, is\\r\\nnot unusually frequent, as expiration (out breathing) is much prolonged.\\r\\nIn severe or prolonged attacks there are blueness, sweating, coldness of\\r\\nthe extremities, with small and frequent pulse and great drowsiness. The\\r\\nattack lasts a few minutes to many hours, and may pass off suddenly,\\r\\nperhaps to recur soon, or on several successive nights, with slight cough\\r\\nand difficulty in breathing in the intervals. The cough is nearly dry at\\r\\nfirst and the sputum is very tenacious.\\r\\n\\r\\nMOTHERS\\' REMEDIES. 1. Asthma, Raspberry Tincture for Adults.--\"Take a half\\r\\npound of honey, one cup water; let these boil, take off the scum; pour\\r\\nboiling hot upon one-half ounce lobelia herb and one-half ounce cloves;\\r\\nmix well, then strain and add one gill of raspberry vinegar. Take from one\\r\\nteaspoonful to a dessertspoonful four times a day. Pleasant to take.\" The\\r\\nabove remedy is very effective, as the honey has a soothing effect upon\\r\\nthe inflamed parts, and the lobelia causes the bronchial tubes to dilate,\\r\\nrelieving the patient. The raspberry tincture makes it more pleasant to\\r\\ntake. In severe cases it will be necessary to give enough of the above\\r\\nremedy to cause vomiting which relieves the phlegm.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Asthma, Simple but Effective Remedy for.--\"Take pieces of ordinary\\r\\nblotting paper and saturate it with a strong solution of saltpetre, then\\r\\ndry the paper. When a paroxysm is felt ignite a piece of the paper and\\r\\ninhale the smoke. This remedy is very good and acts quickly, doing away\\r\\nalmost entirely with the distressing symptoms and shortens the paroxysm.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n[38 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Asthma, Lobelia Tea for.--\"There is no medicine that is half so\\r\\neffective as lobelia in removing the tough, hard ropy phlegm from the\\r\\nasthmatic persons.\" This remedy is very good, but care should be taken not\\r\\nto give it to consumptives, because it is too weakening. To obtain the\\r\\nbest results, enough of the remedy should be given to produce relaxation\\r\\nof the bronchial tubes. Dose.--For adults should be from fifteen to sixty\\r\\ndrops according to the strength of the patient. This will cause a little\\r\\nsickness of the stomach and vomiting, thus relaxing the muscles and\\r\\nrelieving the asthma.\\r\\n\\r\\nPHYSICIANS\\' TREATMENT for Asthma.--1. Inhale chloroform, or break a pearl\\r\\nof amyl nitrite in a handkerchief and inhale the fumes; or smoke saltpetre\\r\\npaper; or cigarettes containing stramonium (thornapple). Sometimes hot\\r\\ncoffee fumes are good.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Prevent Recurrence.--Take five to twenty grains of iodide of potash\\r\\nthree times a day. Do not eat much at night. Do not eat foods that cause\\r\\ngas or that are hard to digest. A change of climate is often good. Hot\\r\\nfoot baths and hot drinks are helpful. Tincture of lobelia can be given in\\r\\nsevere cases, fifteen drops repeated every half hour until the patient\\r\\nfeels sick at the stomach.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Vapo-Cresolene burned in a room is very good. This can be bought in\\r\\ntwenty-five cent bottles in any drug store, with directions around the\\r\\nbottle.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Tartar Emetic in one-hundredth grain, two given every half hour until\\r\\nthere is a little sickening is a very good remedy. These can be bought at\\r\\na drug store or from a homeopathic doctor or pharmacist.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBLEEDING FROM THE WIND-PIPE AND LUNGS. (Haemoptysis).--This is a spitting\\r\\nof blood. It may come from the small bronchial tubes and less frequently\\r\\nfrom the blood vessels in the lung cavities or their walls.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--In incipient consumption of the lungs, bleeding develops\\r\\nsuddenly as a rule, a warm salty taste, lasting but a few moments,\\r\\ngenerally preceded by the spitting up of blood. The blood is coughed up\\r\\nand the bleeding may last only a few minutes or it may continue for days,\\r\\nthe sputum being apt to remain blood-stained for a longer time. The\\r\\nimmediate effect of the bleeding is to alarm the patient and family, no\\r\\nmatter how slight it may be, inducing heart palpitation and other nervous\\r\\nsymptoms. A small bleeding is not attended with any bad result, but large\\r\\nones give rise to the symptoms of shock (sometimes immediate death)\\r\\ncombined with anemia following the loss of blood. When the bleeding is\\r\\nlarge, blood by the mouthful may be ejected with each cough, and in these\\r\\ninstances of such profuse bleeding is shown by dizziness, faintness, cold\\r\\nextremities, excessive pallor, sweating and rapid, small feeble pulse.\\r\\nThis is followed, if the attack does not prove speedily fatal, by\\r\\nrestlessness, and later by mild delirium and some fever. In few cases does\\r\\nthe patient have a single bleeding; more frequently there are several at\\r\\nshorter or longer intervals. Large or small bleedings may precede by\\r\\nweeks, months, or even years any rational symptoms of consumption.\\r\\n\\r\\n[RESPIRATORY DISEASES 39]\\r\\n\\r\\nQuantity.--This varies greatly. There may be less than an ounce or it\\r\\nmight amount to a pint or more before the bleeding stops. In advanced\\r\\ncases, in which large cavities have formed, large blood vessels may be\\r\\neaten through and this followed by copious and alarming bleeding.\\r\\n\\r\\nMOTHERS\\' REMEDIES.--1. Bleeding from the Lungs. Salt Water for.--\"Give the\\r\\npatient half a teaspoonful of common salt every hour or two until\\r\\nhemorrhage abates.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Bleeding from the Lungs. Herb Tea for.--\"Two ounces each of bistory\\r\\nroot, tormentil root, oak bark, and comfrey root, boil in three quarts of\\r\\nwater down to one pint, strain and add one tablespoonful of ground ginger.\\r\\nGive a wine glass full every half hour until relieved. Place the feet in\\r\\nhot mustard water, keep the bowels open with a little senna and ginger tea\\r\\nand if necessary give a vapor bath,\"\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Bleeding from the Lungs, Effective Remedy for.--\\r\\n\\r\\n    \"Powdered Sugar       3 ounces\\r\\n    Powdered Rosin        3 ounces\\r\\n\\r\\nMix. Dose one teaspoonful three times a day.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Bleeding from the Lungs, Tannin and Sugar for.-\\r\\n\\r\\n    \"Tannin             30 grains\\r\\n    Powdered Sugar       1 dram\\r\\n\\r\\nMix. Make ten powders and give one every ten minutes until relieved.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nEither one of the above remedies is excellent for this trouble, as the\\r\\ntannin and rosin contract the arteries and acts as an astringent.\\r\\n\\r\\nPHYSICIANS\\' TREATMENT for Bleeding of the Wind-pipe and Lungs.--In many\\r\\ncases the bleeding is slight and no more need be done than to keep the\\r\\npatient quiet and absolute rest. If the bleeding is free, the patient\\r\\nshould be placed in bed, not allowed to speak above a whisper nor to\\r\\nchange his position.\\r\\n\\r\\n1. First Thing to Do.--Eating ice, and using ice drinks are useful\\r\\nmeasures. The drinking of a little salt water at a time with one\\r\\ntablespoonful of salt in a glassful of water is good. In most cases more\\r\\ncan be done by assuring the patient he will not die and keeping him quiet\\r\\nand at rest. Medicines should be given to satisfy the patient and family.\\r\\nThe most cases stop of themselves.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. If Caused by Coughing.--If cough causes the bleeding one-half grain of\\r\\nopium should be given to control it, hypodermically, or even morphine\\r\\none-eighth grain.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Alum for.--Alum solution six grains to three ounces of water in fine\\r\\nspray is good. This goes right to the wind-pipe and contracts the vessels;\\r\\nuse a vaporizer.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. White Oak Bark Tea can be used as a spray in a vaporizer. If these\\r\\nproduce coughing, they should be discontinued.\\r\\n\\r\\n[40 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\n5. Hot Water and Salt for.--A teaspoonful of salt in a pint of hot water\\r\\nis good also, used as a spray, or to inhale. But the patient must lie\\r\\ndown.\\r\\n\\r\\n6. Other Easily Obtained Remedies.--Ergot in dose of one-half to one\\r\\nteaspoonful is very good; this contracts the vessels. Bromide of potash in\\r\\na dose of five to fifteen grains; or chloral hydrate in dose of five to\\r\\nseven grains, if there is not heart trouble. If there is, chloral hydrate\\r\\ncannot be used. These quiet the nervous system and do much good. Strong\\r\\nhop tea will do the same thing if taken freely. Witch-hazel water thirty\\r\\ndrops at a dose is good.\\r\\n\\r\\nCautions.--Quiet the patient; keep quiet yourself. If the bleeding is bad\\r\\nthe extremities should be bandaged, beginning at the toes and fingers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThirst.--Give small quantities at a time of ice-water.\\r\\n\\r\\nDiet.--Peptonized or plain milk, liquid beef peptonoids, fresh beef juice,\\r\\nbouillon, should be given in small quantities, two or three ounces every\\r\\ntwo or three hours. If there is a tendency to constipation give rectal\\r\\nenemata. Return to the regular diet as soon as possible. Alcohol in any\\r\\nform is best avoided. If given as a stimulant it should be given in small\\r\\nquantities.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBRONCHO-PNEUMONIA. (Acute Inflammation of the Smaller Tubes and Lungs).--\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses.--Most common under two years and in old people. Taking cold,\\r\\nwhooping cough and measles.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--A primary case begins suddenly with a convulsion or chill,\\r\\nvomiting and rapid rise of temperature. Breathing is frequent and brain\\r\\nsymptoms are marked.\\r\\n\\r\\nSecondary Cases.--After an ordinary case of whooping-cough, measles,\\r\\nbronchitis, etc., there is more fever. The pulse is more frequent, and\\r\\nalso the respiration, difficulty in breathing and severe and often painful\\r\\ncough. Temperature rises to 102 to 104; respirations are very fast, up to\\r\\n60 to 80; the breathing (inspiration) is hard, labored, while the wings of\\r\\nthe nose dilate; expiration may be grunting. Face looks anxious and\\r\\nbluish. This color may increase, other symptoms decreasing as suffocation\\r\\ndeepens, rattling in chest and death from heart weakness.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrevention.--Avoid exposure to sudden changes of temperature. For the\\r\\nattack, jacket of oil silk or flannel to prevent sudden exposure, keep the\\r\\ntemperature warmed up to 68 to 70 degrees night and day; the air must be\\r\\nfresh and pure and changed regularly.\\r\\n\\r\\n[RESPIRATORY DISEASES 41]\\r\\n\\r\\nChildren should be given ample room and not hampered by extra clothing, as\\r\\nthey like change of position, to get relief. The hot bath must be used\\r\\noften to redden the skin and relieve the pressure on the lungs, till they\\r\\ncan be given relief. If you wish to use a poultice the following is a nice\\r\\nway to make it. Take a piece of muslin or linen, or cheese-cloth, wide\\r\\nenough when doubled to reach from the lower margin of the ribs to well up\\r\\nunder the arm pits, and long enough to go a little more than around the\\r\\nchest, open the double fold and spread the hot mass of poultice on\\r\\none-half of the cloth and fold the other over it. It should be applied as\\r\\nhot as it can be comfortably borne and covered with oil silk or paraffin\\r\\npaper, so as to the longer retain the heat and moisture. The poultice\\r\\nshould be renewed as often as it gets cold, and a fresh poultice should be\\r\\nall ready to put on when the old one is taken off. Place the end of the\\r\\npoultice uppermost, so that the contents will not fall out.\\r\\n\\r\\nMOTHERS\\' REMEDIES. 1. Pneumonia, Herb Tea and Poultice for.--\"Congestion\\r\\nof the lungs. One ounce of each of the following, slippery elm bark,\\r\\ncrushed thyme, coltsfoot flowers, hyssop or marshmallow. Simmer in two\\r\\nquarts of water down to three pints; strain and add one teaspoonful of\\r\\ncayenne. Dose:--Wineglassful every half hour. Apply hot bran poultices or\\r\\nchamomile scalded in vinegar, changing often until the violence of the\\r\\nsymptoms abate. If the bowels are confined, give an injection of half pint\\r\\nof hot water in which one-half teaspoonful each of gum myrrh, turkey\\r\\nrhubarb and ginger powder have been well mixed. If possible give vapor\\r\\nbath. Apply hot stones or bottles to the feet.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Pneumonia, Home Remedy for.--\"This can easily be relieved by the use of\\r\\ncayenne and vapor bath. This promotes the circulation in every part of the\\r\\nbody, diminishing the pressure upon the lungs. These baths produce a\\r\\nregular circulation throughout the whole body, thus relieving the pressure\\r\\nupon the lungs by decreasing the amount of blood in the lungs. These baths\\r\\nshould be taken but once a day, as they are weakening.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Pneumonia, Hot Vinegar Applications for.--Congestion of Lungs.--\"Over\\r\\nthe lungs lay cloths wet in clear hot vinegar. They should be five or six\\r\\ninches square and several thicknesses. Over the cloths lay a hot plate or\\r\\nhot water bottle; change as often as necessary to keep them hot. This\\r\\ntreatment will soon give relief, after which rub as much oil into the\\r\\nlungs as possible.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPHYSICIANS\\' TREATMENT for Pneumonia.--A doctor must be called. For high\\r\\nfever, one to one and a half drops of aconite, for adults every hour; for\\r\\nchildren, about one-twelfth to one-eighth of a drop. For cough, chloride\\r\\nof ammonium, one to two grain doses. For pain, hot applications.\\r\\n\\r\\nDiet.--Milk, broth and egg albumen and plenty of water to drink. (See\\r\\nlaryngitis for diet.)\\r\\n\\r\\nACUTE PLEURISY (Inflammation of the Pleura).--The pleura covers the wall\\r\\nof the chest cavity and infolds or surrounds the lungs. Pleurisy means the\\r\\ninflammation of this pleura or covering.\\r\\n\\r\\n[42 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses.--Exposure to cold, etc. Onset may be gradual or sudden, with\\r\\nchills fever and sharp stitches in the side near the arm pit or breast.\\r\\nThe patient lies on the affected side during the attack, the pain is made\\r\\nworse by breathing, coughing or motion. The cough is dry and painful, with\\r\\ndifficult breathing. The temperature 102 to 103. Sometimes there is fluid\\r\\naccumulated in the cavity. In about seven to ten days the fever and other\\r\\nsymptoms disappear. The fluid is absorbed quickly if it is scanty, often\\r\\nvery slowly if abundant. This fluid is contained in the cavity of the\\r\\npleura. The pleura covers the lungs. Its outer layer is attached to the\\r\\nribs and costal cartilages in front and ribs behind, goes around the foot\\r\\nof the lungs underneath, then turns around under the side of the lungs and\\r\\ncomes in front, making a sac. The two layers in health touch each other,\\r\\nbut are separated when there is fluid in the cavity. The inner layer\\r\\ncovers the lungs and drops into the grooves of the lungs. You can thus\\r\\nreadily understand how easy it is for the pleura to be attacked. Also when\\r\\nthe lung is inflamed we have what we call pleura-pneumonia. Pleurisy is a\\r\\nvery painful disease. It hurts to move, breathe, or cough. The patient\\r\\nholds his chest when he coughs. The fluid that forms is poured out from\\r\\nthe inflamed membrane, sometimes it is so great in quantity it must be\\r\\ndrawn off,--tapped; we then call this hydrothorax,--water in the chest.\\r\\n\\r\\nDiet and Nursing--The patient should be kept quiet and in the easiest\\r\\nposition.\\r\\n\\r\\nMilk diet is the best to use. There should not be much liquid diet, except\\r\\nmilk. The milk may be diluted with lime water if necessary. Malted milk,\\r\\nMellin\\'s food, imperial granum, can be used when the milk cannot be taken.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPHYSICIANS\\' TREATMENT for Pleurisy.--1. Home Remedy.--The patient must go\\r\\nto bed and remain there. It is a good thing to get the patient in a sweat.\\r\\nFor this purpose you can use the corn sweat described under treatment of\\r\\nla grippe. This will ease the patient and may shorten the attack.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have great faith in this remedy in most inflammatory diseases. I had a\\r\\npatient sick with pleurisy; she did not get along fast enough to suit me,\\r\\nher color was a yellow-green. I advised the corn sweat and she improved\\r\\nfast from that time. Her night dress was green in color after the sweat. I\\r\\nhave saved pneumonia cases in the same way. Of course, some cases may be\\r\\ntoo weak to stand it.\\r\\n\\r\\n[RESPIRATORY DISEASES 43]\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Other Home Remedies.--Another way to produce sweating is by placing\\r\\nfruit cans filled with hot water about the patient. This will stop the\\r\\nchilly cold feeling and also will relieve the pain. If you have a rubber\\r\\nwater bottle, put hot water in that and place it near the sorest spot. It\\r\\nmay hurt the patient by its weight; if so, use less water, at the same\\r\\ntime you can give hot drinks freely. Almost  any kind will do. If the\\r\\nstomach feels bad, ginger or peppermint is best. Hoarhound tea is\\r\\nespecially good for chest trouble.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Fomentations.--Of hops or wormwood or smartweed, or catnip applied\\r\\nfrequently and hot to the affected side often bring relief. They must\\r\\nalways be hot, and you must be careful not to get the night robes or\\r\\ncovers wet.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Camphorated Oil for.--Rub the side with camphorated oil and cover over\\r\\nwith a cotton jacket. This is good unless it makes the patient too warm.\\r\\n\\r\\n5. Adhesive Plaster Zinc Oxide.--Use a roll two or two and one-half inches\\r\\nwide. Commence at the backbone and cross directly over the ribs to the\\r\\nfurther side of the breastbone. The first strip should be at the lower\\r\\npart of the chest. In putting on the succeeding strips make them lap\\r\\none-half inch over the next lower. Bandage almost up to the arm-pit. It\\r\\nmay take eight strips for an adult. After you have the strips on, place a\\r\\npiece at each end, part on the flesh and part on the plasters, to keep\\r\\nthem from giving any. The patient should have his arms over his head when\\r\\nyou are putting on the strips. This strapping will hold that side of the\\r\\nchest quieter. The breathing will be less full and consequently less\\r\\nmotion and pain.\\r\\n\\r\\n6. Tincture of aconite in doses of one-tenth to one drop can be given\\r\\neveryone to three hours at the beginning, if there is much fever, dry hot\\r\\nskin, and full bounding pulse. Dover\\'s powder can be given at night.\\r\\n\\r\\n7. A hypodermic of morphine is frequently given when the pain is intense.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nABSCESS OF THE LUNGS. Causes.--Lobular pneumonia from abscesses in pyemia,\\r\\nfrom septic pleurisy, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--Fever, pain, difficult breathing, cough, and expectoration\\r\\ncontaining or consisting of pus of offensive odor, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nPHYSICIANS\\' TREATMENT of Abscess of the Lungs.--Incision and drainage. You\\r\\nmust depend entirely upon your physician.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEMPHYSEMA.--A condition in which there is air or gas in tissues that\\r\\nnormally have none, or an excess of air in tissues that normally contain a\\r\\ncertain quantity of it. A condition of the lungs characterized by a\\r\\npermanent dilation of the air cells of the lung with dwindling of the air\\r\\ncell walls and the blood vessels, resulting in a loss of the normal\\r\\nelasticity of the lung tissue.\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses.--Heredity; it occurs in glass blowers, in musicians using wind\\r\\ninstruments. It occurs also after whooping-cough, asthma, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHYDROTHORAX.--This is an exudation (liquid) in the pleural cavity.\\r\\nCauses.--Comes from disease causing dropsy, kidney disease, lung trouble,\\r\\npleurisy, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\n[44 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nPHYSICIANS\\' TREATMENT.--Treat disease that causes it. An operation to\\r\\nremove the fluid may be necessary. A trusted physician must advise you.\\r\\n\\r\\nNIGHT SWEATS.--These are common in \"consumption\" and constitute one of the\\r\\nmost distressing features of the disease. They usually occur when the\\r\\nfever drops in the early morning hours, or at any time of the day when the\\r\\npatient is sleeping. They may come on early in the disease, but are more\\r\\npersistent and frequent after cavities have formed in the lungs; some of\\r\\nthe patients escape it altogether.\\r\\n\\r\\nMOTHERS\\' REMEDIES.-l. Night Sweats, Salt Bath for.--\"Bathe the body in\\r\\nsalt water every other day. Just before retiring take a cup of sage tea,\\r\\nand eat nourishing food,\" The salt acts as an astringent as it slightly\\r\\ncloses up the pores, and the sage establishes a better circulation and at\\r\\nthe same time helps the sweating. This is a very simple and effective\\r\\nremedy.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Night Sweats, Cold Sage for.--\"Drink cold sage tea, before retiring.\"\\r\\nThis cold sage tea is only to be used when the patient has a fever and\\r\\nneeds a cold drink. In case of this kind it would be effective.\\r\\n\\r\\nPHYSICIAN\\'S TREATMENT for Night Sweats.--l. Atropine in doses of 1-120 to\\r\\n1-60 grain is good to stop the sweating. It must be used carefully, three\\r\\ndoses in twenty-four hours are enough.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Tonics to keep up the appetite like gentian, nux vomica or quinine may\\r\\nbe given. The patient should wear flannel night-dresses, as the cotton\\r\\nnight-shirt, when soaked with perspiration, has a cold, clammy feeling.\\r\\nBathe the patient in the morning with tepid water and afterwards rub\\r\\ngently with alcohol diluted one-half with water. Night sweating occurs in\\r\\nrickets but mainly around the head. They also occur when one is run down,\\r\\nbut they are not so debilitating and constant. In such cases, building up\\r\\ntreatment is needed. Proper diet, bathing, out-door life, bitter tonics,\\r\\netc.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[ANIMAL PARASITES 45]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nANIMAL PARASITES, DISEASES CAUSED BY.\\r\\n\\r\\nROUND WORM.--(Ascariasis Lumbricoides).--The round worm resembles the\\r\\nangle worm in form; is the most common human parasite and is found chiefly\\r\\nin children. The female is seven to twelve inches long, the male four to\\r\\neight inches. It is pointed at both ends. The parasite occupies the upper\\r\\npart of the small bowel and there is usually only one or two present, but\\r\\nsometimes they occur in enormous numbers. They migrate in a peculiar\\r\\nmanner. They may pass into the stomach, whence they may be thrown out by\\r\\nvomiting, or they may crawl up the gullet, and enter the pharynx and cause\\r\\nserious trouble. They may go up the eustachian tube and appear at the\\r\\nexternal meatus (opening of ear). The serious migration is into the\\r\\nbile-duct. There is a specimen in the Wister-Horner Museum of the\\r\\nUniversity of Pennsylvania in which not only the common bile-duct, but\\r\\nalso the main branches throughout the liver, are enormously distended, and\\r\\npacked with numerous round worms. The bowel may be blocked or in rare\\r\\ninstances an ulcer may be perforated; even the healthy bowel may be\\r\\nperforated.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--Picking of the nose, grinding of the teeth, a whitish paleness\\r\\naround the mouth, restless sleep; sometimes convulsions, or presence of\\r\\nworms in the stool. Bad health, cross, peevish, irritable and dumpy, when\\r\\nthe child is naturally the opposite.\\r\\n\\r\\nMOTHERS\\' REMEDIES.--l. Round or Pin Worms, Sage Tea for.--\"Sage tea is a\\r\\nfine remedy for children troubled with worms, taken before breakfast or on\\r\\ngoing to bed.\" Sage tea may help; I have known other mothers to have faith\\r\\nin it. Its virtue may consist in being a laxative and an antiseptic which\\r\\nin themselves would add to the general health of the child.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Round and Pin Worms, Tansy remedy for.--\"Tansy leaves may be crushed\\r\\nand put in whisky or dried and crushed with sugar. This is the best\\r\\nvermifuge I ever used.\" A tea made of tansy leaves must be used carefully\\r\\nas it is strong and never given to pregnant women.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Round and Pin Worms, Peach Leaf Tea for.--\"Half an ounce of dried peach\\r\\nleaves may be infused in a pint of boiling water and a tablespoonful given\\r\\nfor a dose three times a day.\" They are laxative and exert a sedative\\r\\ninfluence over the nervous system. They have been frequently used for\\r\\nworms with reported success. An infusion is highly recommended in\\r\\nirritability of the bladder, in sick stomach and in whooping cough.\\r\\n\\r\\nPHYSICIANS\\' TREATMENT.--l. Dr. Osler, of Oxford, England, recommends as\\r\\nfollows: Santonin in doses of two or three grains for an adult; one or two\\r\\na day for three or four days, followed by salts or calomel; one-half to\\r\\none grain for children in the same way. This seems to me to be\\r\\nunnecessarily large.\\r\\n\\r\\n[46 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Dr. Ritter\\'s Santonin Remedy.--\\r\\n\\r\\n    I always give it thus:\\r\\n    Santonin      1/10 grain\\r\\n    Calomel       1/10 grain\\r\\n\\r\\nGive four a day for two days, then miss two days, then give again for two\\r\\ndays and stop. Salts can be given after this. I then follow this treatment\\r\\nby giving one drop doses of tincture of cina (Homeopathic preparation)\\r\\nfour times a day for one or two weeks. Before giving any of these remedies\\r\\nit is well to move the bowels freely and also after the medicine has been\\r\\nstopped.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Dr. Douglass of Detroit, Michigan, recommends the following for a child\\r\\nfive to ten years old:\\r\\n\\r\\n    Santonin     12 grains\\r\\n    Calomel       3 grains\\r\\n\\r\\nDivide into six powders, and give one night and morning while fasting.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. The following is from Professor Stille:\\r\\n\\r\\n    Spigelia       1/2 ounce\\r\\n    Senna            2 drams\\r\\n    Fennel seed      2 drams\\r\\n    Manna            1 ounce\\r\\n    Boiling water    1 pint\\r\\n\\r\\nMix and make into an infusion (tea). Dose for a child, one or two\\r\\nteaspoonfuls. For an adult, one or two wineglassfuls.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHREAD WORM OR PIN WORM.--(Oxyuris Vermicularis.)--This common worm\\r\\noccupies the rectum and colon. They produce great irritation and itching,\\r\\nparticularly at night, symptoms which become intensely aggravated by the\\r\\nnightly migration (traveling) of the parasite. They sometimes in their\\r\\ntravels enter the vagina. Occasionally abscesses are formed around the\\r\\nbowel (rectum) containing numbers of worms. The patient becomes extremely\\r\\nrestless and irritable, for the sleep is very often disturbed, and there\\r\\nmay be loss of appetite and also anemia. These worms are most common in\\r\\nchildren, but they can occur in all ages. The worms can easily be seen in\\r\\nthe feces. The infection takes place through the drinking of water and\\r\\npossibly through salads, such as lettuce and cresses, and various other\\r\\nmeans. A person who is the subject of worms passes ova (eggs) in large\\r\\nnumbers in the feces, and the possibility of reinfection must be guarded\\r\\nagainst very scrupulously.\\r\\n\\r\\nMOTHERS\\' REMEDIES.--1. Pin worms, Aloes treatment for.--\"Pin worms or seat\\r\\nworms are usually found in children and sometime cause a great deal of\\r\\nannoyance to the child.

It can be given for weeks without producing bad effects. The\\r\\ndose can be made less for weakly children; or greater in grown people. It\\r\\nis good to give in small doses in pin worms when injections are used. It\\r\\nseems to prevent their formation. It is also a good remedy for the worms\\r\\npuppies are troubled with. I have saved the lives of a good many little\\r\\nfellows with this remedy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTAPE WORM, PORK.-(Taenia Solium). It is six to twelve feet long, but it is\\r\\nnot a common form in this country. The head is small, round, not so large\\r\\nas the head of a pin and provided with four sucking ducts and a double row\\r\\nof hooklets. By these hooklets and disks, the parasite attaches itself to\\r\\nthe mucous membrane of the small intestine in man. Below the head is a\\r\\nconstricted neck, which is followed by a large number of segments,\\r\\nincreasing in size from the neck onward. Each segment contains the\\r\\ngenerative organs of both sexes. The parasite (worm) becomes fully grown\\r\\nin three to three and one-half months. Segments then continually break off\\r\\nand are discharged at stool. Each ovum (egg) contains a single embryo,\\r\\narmed with six hooklets and contained in a thick shell. When swallowed by\\r\\na pig or man these shells are digested and the embryos migrate (travel) to\\r\\nvarious parts of the body, where they change to Cysticerci or \"Measles.\"\\r\\nEach contains a scolex or tape-worm. When meat, improperly cooked and\\r\\ncontaining \"measles,\" is eaten, the cyst is dissolved in the human stomach\\r\\nand the free scolex or head attaches itself to the intestinal mucous\\r\\nmembrane and grows into a tapeworm.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTAPE WORM, BEEF.--(Taenia Saginata). This is a larger and longer parasite\\r\\nthan the Pork Tape Worm. It is the common form found in this country. It\\r\\nmay grow fifteen to twenty feet or more and possesses a large head in\\r\\ncomparison with the Taenia Solium. It is square shaped and has four large\\r\\nsucking disks, but no hooklets. The ripe segments are larger and they are\\r\\npassed as in the Taemia Solium, and are eaten by cattle, in the flesh or\\r\\norgans of which the eggs develop into the Cysticerci.\\r\\n\\r\\n[ANIMAL PARASITES  49]\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--These worms (parasites) are found at all ages. They are not\\r\\nuncommon in children, and may be found in nursing children. They may cause\\r\\nexcessive appetite, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or  abdominal pain or\\r\\nsometimes anemia. The knowledge of the presence of this worm may cause\\r\\ngreat nervousness or depression. The presence of the segment in the stools\\r\\nproves their presence in the bowels.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment, preventive.--This is most important. Careful attention should\\r\\nbe given to three points: First, all tapeworm segments should be burned.\\r\\nThey should never be thrown into the water-closet or outside; secondly,\\r\\nspecial inspection of all meat; and, thirdly, cooking the meat\\r\\nsufficiently to kill the parasites.\\r\\n\\r\\nMOTHERS\\' REMEDIES.--1.

During this time a little milk can be given, and after\\r\\na night of fasting, before breakfast, the worm medicine (anthelmintic)\\r\\nmust be swallowed. In addition, nearly all the drugs must be followed by\\r\\npurges in order to dislodge the intruder while he is paralyzed and has\\r\\nlost his hold; and in many it is well to have a basin of salt and water\\r\\nready so that when a passage occurs a rectal injection may be given to\\r\\nwash out the segments of the worm which remain in the rectum. I am giving\\r\\nmany remedies and the different ways of administering them. Not every one\\r\\ncan be cured with the same remedy. One will act better in some people than\\r\\nin others. So I give a variety and they are all good.\\r\\n\\r\\n1. For two days prior to the administration of the remedies the patient\\r\\nshould take a very light, diet and have the bowels moved by a saline\\r\\n(salts) cathartic. As a rule the male fern acts promptly and well. The\\r\\netheral extract of male fern in two dram doses may be given; fast, and\\r\\nfollow in the course of a couple of hours by a brisk purgative; that is,\\r\\ncalomel followed by salts.\\r\\n\\r\\nFasting means this: Light diet for a day or two and a cathartic at night,\\r\\nno supper except a glass of milk before the worm medicine is given. Then\\r\\nat bed-time take two to three grains of calomel with ten grains of\\r\\nbicarbonate of sodium; rochelle salts, one-half to one ounce, upon\\r\\nawakening. As soon as the bowels have moved give oleorisin of aspidium,\\r\\none dram in capsules. A saline cathartic should be given one-half to one\\r\\nhour later. Never give castor oil or any oil after this remedy, When\\r\\ncalomel is given it should be given about one hour after taking the worm\\r\\nmedicine and followed in one or one and one-half hours by a half to one\\r\\nounce of salts.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Pelletierine Remedy for.--This comes in bottles of the proper dose. It\\r\\nis dear, but effective. It must be taken lying down, and followed by some\\r\\ncathartic or a dose of epsom salts in two hours after taking.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Infusion and Emulsion for.--An infusion of\\r\\n\\r\\n      Pomegranate root   1/2 ounce\\r\\n      Pumpkin seeds        1 ounce\\r\\n      Powdered ergot       1 dram\\r\\n      Boiling water       10 ounces\\r\\n\\r\\nTo an emulsion of the male fern (a dram of the ethereal extract) made with\\r\\nacacia powders, two drops of croton oil are added. The patient should have\\r\\nhad a low diet on the previous day and have taken a dose of salts in the\\r\\nevening.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe emulsion and infusion are mixed and taken at nine in the morning. If\\r\\nthe bowels do not move in two hours, salts should be taken.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. An Old Remedy.--Chew freely of slippery elm bark. This, it is stated,\\r\\nis very effective and as it is cheap and will not injure, it is worth a\\r\\nthorough trial. I am often surprised at the value of the seemingly simple\\r\\nremedies.\\r\\n\\r\\n[ANIMAL PARASITES  51]\\r\\n\\r\\nTRICHINIASIS (Trichinosis).--The disease is caused by the trichina\\r\\nspiratis, a parasite introduced into the body by eating imperfectly cooked\\r\\nflesh of infected hogs. The \"embryos\" pass from the bowel and reach the\\r\\nvoluntary muscles, where they finally become \"encapsulated\\r\\nlarvae,\"--muscle trichinae. It is in the migration of these embryos that\\r\\nthe group of symptoms known as trichiniasis is produced.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the flesh containing the trichinae is eaten by man or by any animal\\r\\nin which the development can take place, the capsules are digested and the\\r\\ntrichinae are set free. They pass into the small intestine and about the\\r\\nthird day attain their full growth and become sexually mature. The young\\r\\nproduced by each female trichina have been estimated at several hundred.\\r\\nThe time from the eating of the flesh containing the muscle trichinae to\\r\\nthe development of the brood of embryos in the intestines (bowels) is from\\r\\nseven to nine days. The female worm penetrates the intestinal wall and the\\r\\nembryos are probably discharged into the lymph spaces, thence into the\\r\\nvenous system, and by the blood stream to the muscles, which constitutes\\r\\ntheir seat of election. After a preliminary migration in the\\r\\ninter-muscular connective tissue, they penetrate the primitive muscle-\\r\\nfibres and in about two weeks develop into the full grown muscle form. In\\r\\nthis process interstitial inflammation of the muscle is excited, and\\r\\ngradually an ovoid capsule develops about the parasite. Two, and\\r\\noccasionally three or four, worms may be seen within a single capsule.\\r\\nThis process of encapsulation has been estimated to take about six weeks.\\r\\nWithin the muscles the parasites do not undergo further development.\\r\\nGradually the capsule becomes thicker and ultimately lime salts are\\r\\ndeposited within it. This change may take place in man within four or five\\r\\nmonths. The trichinae may live within the muscles for an indefinite\\r\\nperiod. They have been found alive and capable of developing as late as\\r\\ntwenty or twenty-five years after their entrance into the system. These\\r\\ncalcified capsules appear as white specks in the muscles. In many\\r\\ninstances however these worms are completely calcified. In the hog the\\r\\ntrichinae cause few if any symptoms. An animal, the muscles of which are\\r\\nswarming with living trichinae, may be well nourished and healthy looking.\\r\\nAn important point also is the fact that in the hog the capsule does not\\r\\nreadily become calcified, so that the parasites are not visible as in the\\r\\nhuman muscles.\\r\\n\\r\\nModes of Infection.--The danger of infection depends entirely upon the\\r\\nmode of preparation of the flesh. Thorough cooking, so that all parts of\\r\\nthe meat reach the boiling point, destroys the parasites; but, in larger\\r\\njoints, the central portions are not often raised to this temperature. The\\r\\nfrequency of the disease in different countries depends largely upon the\\r\\nhabits of the people in the preparation of pork. In North Germany, where\\r\\nraw ham and wurst are freely eaten, the greatest number of instances have\\r\\noccurred. In South Germany, France, and England cases are rare. Salting\\r\\nand smoking the flesh are not always sufficient, and the Havre experiments\\r\\nshowed that animals are readily infected when fed with portions of the\\r\\npickled or the smoked meat as prepared in this country.\\r\\n\\r\\n[52 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--The eating of trichinous flesh is not always followed by this\\r\\ndisease.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the course of a few days after eating the infected meat there are signs\\r\\nof disturbance of the stomach and bowels, and pain in the abdomen, loss of\\r\\nappetite, vomiting and sometimes diarrhea; and yet, these preliminary\\r\\nsymptoms do not always occur, for in some of the large epidemics cases\\r\\nhave been observed in which they have been absent. Pain in different parts\\r\\nof the body, general debility and weakness have been noted in some of the\\r\\nepidemics. In some instances the stomach and bowel disturbances have been\\r\\nso marked from the outset that the attack resembled our cholera. The\\r\\ninvasion symptoms develop between the seventh and tenth day. Sometimes not\\r\\nuntil the end of the second week, and they are marked by fever, a chill in\\r\\nsome cases and pain and swelling and tenderness along the muscles\\r\\ninvolved. The migration of the parasites into the muscles excites a more\\r\\nor less intense inflammation of these muscles, which is characterized by\\r\\npain on pressure and movement, and by swelling and tension of the muscles,\\r\\nover which the skin may be swollen. The limbs are placed in some position\\r\\nin which these muscles are more at rest. Difficulty in chewing and\\r\\nswallowing is caused by the involvement of the muscles controlling these\\r\\nacts. In severe cases the involvement of the diaphragm and intercostal\\r\\nmuscles may lead to difficult breathing (Dyspnoea) which sometimes proves\\r\\nfatal. Watery swelling, a feature of great importance, may be seen early\\r\\nin the face, particularly about the, eyes. Later it develops in the\\r\\nextremities when the swelling and stiffness of the muscles are at their\\r\\nheight. Profuse sweats, tingling and itching of the skin and in some\\r\\ninstances hives (Urticaria) have been described.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are emaciation and anemia. In the severe cases the appearance may be\\r\\nlike that in the third week of typhoid fever. In mild cases the fever and\\r\\nmuscular symptoms subside in ten to fourteen days, in others only after\\r\\ntwo or three months. The mortality, from one to thirty per cent, seems to\\r\\ndepend upon the virulence and number of parasites.\\r\\n\\r\\nPHYSICIANS\\' TREATMENT.--If discovered within twenty-four to thirty-six\\r\\nhours, thoroughly empty the bowel with purgatives. Rhubarb and senna, or\\r\\nan occasional dose of calomel may be given. Relieve the pains afterwards\\r\\nand support the strength.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SKIN DISEASES  53]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDISEASES OF THE SKIN.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe skin is divided into three layers. Beginning with the outer one and\\r\\nnaming inward, they are named as follows: The outer layer is called the\\r\\nepidermis or cuticle (near or upon the skin). The second layer is called\\r\\nthe corium, derma cutis vera, or true skin. The third layer is called the\\r\\nsub-cutaneous (under the skin) (fatty or connective) tissue. This last\\r\\nlayer contains the sweat glands, the lower end of the deep-seated hair\\r\\nfollicles, (little sacs containing the roots of the hair) and larger\\r\\nbranches of the lymphatics, blood vessels and nerves, and serves in\\r\\ngeneral as a bed for the true skin to rest upon, and by which the true\\r\\nskin is connected with the deeper parts, muscles, etc. The appendages of\\r\\nthe skin are the hair, nails, sebaceous and sweat-glands. The discharge\\r\\nfrom the sweat-glands form a little or larger tumor. The contents of a wen\\r\\nare from sebaceous glands--fat secretions--fat tumor. The following names\\r\\nare frequently mentioned in the skin diseases:\\r\\n\\r\\nMacule. (Spots, patches). Skin is altered in color, but the skin is not\\r\\nraised or depressed; freckle, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nPapule. (Pimple). Elevated piece of skin, varying in size from a pin-head\\r\\nto a coffee bean.\\r\\n\\r\\nTubercle. (Node-lump). A solid elevation of the skin, varying in size from\\r\\na pea to a cherry.\\r\\n\\r\\nTumors. These are soft or firm elevations of the skin, like a wen or hard\\r\\nlump. They are always deep-seated.\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel. A round flat, white or pink elevation of the skin; such as hives,\\r\\nmosquito bites, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nVesicle. This is a pin-head or pea-sized elevation of the outer layer\\r\\n(epidermis) filled with a watery fluid.\\r\\n\\r\\nBleb. (Bulla). A circumscribed elevation of the skin and contains a watery\\r\\nfluid, such as a burn, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nPustule. A rounded elevation of the outer layer (epidermis) of varying\\r\\nsize, containing pus (matter).\\r\\n\\r\\nA vesicle, bleb, and pustule are hollow; macule, papule, and tubercle are\\r\\nsolid.\\r\\n\\r\\nScale.

This is about as good a cure as\\r\\nthere is for corns. After this paste has been on the corn for three days,\\r\\nit should be removed and the feet soaked well, and the corn scraped off.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Corns, Turpentine and Kerosene for.--\"A very simple remedy is to apply\\r\\nturpentine or kerosene oil to the affected part on going to bed.\" It is\\r\\nalways a good plan to soak the feet well before treating the corn, as the\\r\\nturpentine will penetrate more quickly.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Corns, to Remove Without Pain.--\\r\\n\\r\\n    \"Alcohol         1/2 ounce\\r\\n    Muriatic Acid      1 dram\\r\\n    Nitric Acid        1 dram\\r\\n    Oil of Rosemary    1 dram\\r\\n    Chloroform         2 drams\\r\\n    Tincture Iron      2 drams\\r\\n\\r\\nMix the above, and apply freely to the corn with little brush or feather\\r\\nuntil it can be removed with thumb lance. It may require several\\r\\napplications.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Corns, Onion a Cure for.--\"Soak a small onion in vinegar four hours,\\r\\nthen cut in two and bind on the corn at night.

If not cured in first application repeat.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n[SKIN DISEASES 59]\\r\\n\\r\\n5. Corns, Castile Soap an Effective Remedy for.--\"Rub the corn night and\\r\\nmorning with castile soap, as often as possible shave it, being careful\\r\\nnot to cut deep enough to make it bleed.\" Be faithful in soaping it\\r\\nthoroughly night and morning for several days until it disappears. This is\\r\\na very simple but effective remedy.\\r\\n\\r\\n6. Hard Corns, Iodine a Successful Remedy for.--\"Paint the corns with\\r\\niodine every night for three nights, stop three nights, then apply three\\r\\nnights again, and so on for two weeks.\" Have tried this and know it to be\\r\\nvery successful, especially good for hard corns.\\r\\n\\r\\n7. Corns, Castor Oil for.--\"Apply castor oil; rub it thoroughly, then soak\\r\\nfeet. It will soften and remove corns.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n8. Corns, Vinegar and Bread for.--\"Take bread and soak in vinegar for\\r\\ntwenty-four hours, put a plaster on for three or four nights. If not cured\\r\\non first application, repeat.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPHYSICIANS\\' TREATMENT for Corns.--Remove the cause; soften them by\\r\\nprolonged soaking in hot water, and then gently scrape off the softened\\r\\nparticles, continue this for several days; then put a narrow strip of\\r\\nrubber or salicylated plaster (adhesive plaster) over to protect them from\\r\\npressure. The following is good to soften them:\\r\\n\\r\\n1.  Salicylic Acid               1-1/2 dram\\r\\n    Extract of Cannabis indica      10 grains\\r\\n    Collodion                        1 ounce\\r\\n\\r\\nMix and paint on the corn for several days and after soaking corn scrape\\r\\nit off with a sharp knife.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. A Good but Weaker Remedy:-\\r\\n\\r\\n    Salicylic Acid                      30 grains\\r\\n    Extract of Cannabis indica     5 to 10 grains\\r\\n    Collodion                          1/2 ounce\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth of these prescriptions are good, the first being stronger with\\r\\nsalicylic acid.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. When the corns are soft with inflammation, wash and dry the foot and\\r\\napply a solution of nitrate of silver, sixty to one hundred and twenty\\r\\ngrains to the ounce of water, to every part every four or five days.\\r\\n\\r\\nUlcerating Corns.--Cauterize with nitrate of silver in stick form.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCARBUNCLE. (Anthrax).--A carbuncle is an acute circumscribed inflammation\\r\\nof the skin and tissues beneath, of the size of an egg, orange, or larger.\\r\\nIt is a hard mass and ends in local death of some of the tissue and\\r\\nformation of pus, which empties upon the surface through several\\r\\nsieve-like openings.\\r\\n\\r\\n[60 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--There is a feeling of general sickness, chilliness and some\\r\\nfever. The skin over the sore part is hot and painful. The several dead\\r\\nparts may run together until the entire mass separates in a slough. In\\r\\nfavorable cases it proceeds to heal kindly, but in severe cases it may\\r\\nspread to the surrounding tissues and end fatally, sometimes by the\\r\\nabsorption of putrid materials, or by the resulting weakness. It runs\\r\\nusually from two to five weeks.\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses.--It comes in middle or advanced life, usually oftener in men than\\r\\nin women. It occurs frequently in patients suffering from diabetes, in\\r\\nwhom it is usually fatal.\\r\\n\\r\\nMOTHERS\\' REMEDIES. Carbuncles, Poppy Leaves to Draw and Ripen.--\"A\\r\\npoultice of poppy leaves is very efficacious to draw or ripen a\\r\\ncarbuncle.\" A poultice made from these leaves is very quieting and\\r\\nsoothing, and at the same time will cause the carbuncle to ripen.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Carbuncle, Slippery Elm and Sassafras Root for.--\"Sassafras root and\\r\\nslippery elm bark boiled together and the decoction thickened with\\r\\ncornmeal.\" This should be changed as often as it becomes cool.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Carbuncle, Sheep Sorrel Poultice for.--\"Gather a bunch of sheep sorrel\\r\\nleaves, wrap them in a cabbage leaf and roast in the oven. Apply to the\\r\\ncarbuncle, and it will soon ripen and break.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Carbuncle, Bread and Milk Poultice for.--\"Keep warm bread and milk\\r\\npoultice on until the core comes out, then put on salve or vaselin and\\r\\nkeep covered until all healed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n5. Carbuncle, the Common Scabious for.--\"Take scabious, the green herb and\\r\\nbruise it. Apply this to the affected part. This has been found a very\\r\\neffectual remedy.\" The common field scabious have many hairy, soft,\\r\\nwhitish green leaves, some of which are very small and rough on the edges,\\r\\nothers have hairy green leaves deeply and finely divided and branched a\\r\\nlittle. Flowers size of small walnut and composed of many little ones.\\r\\nSometimes called \"Morning Bride,\" \"Devil\\'s Bit,\" etc.\\r\\n\\r\\n6. Carbuncle, Snap Bean Poultice for.--\"Apply snap bean leaves beat up\\r\\nfine. Bruise the leaves until they are real fine, then apply as a\\r\\npoultice.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPHYSICIANS\\' TREATMENT for Carbuncles.--Keep up the strength by a\\r\\nnourishing diet and in some cases, stimulants.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SKIN DISEASES 61]\\r\\n\\r\\nLocal.--Cut it open thoroughly by a cross (crucial) cut, like this (x).\\r\\nThe cut must reach through the mass to sound tissue beneath and beyond it.\\r\\nThen scrape out all the dead tissue. Dress with iodoform or sterile gauze.\\r\\nAn antiseptic like listerine, glyco-thymoline, etc., can be used to wet\\r\\nthe gauze, put on as a dressing afterwards and then more dry gauze above,\\r\\nstrapped with adhesive plaster. Water and instruments must be boiled,\\r\\nhands must be absolutely clean. Everything around it must be clean.\\r\\nSometimes it is necessary to go slowly and take out at each dressing only\\r\\nwhat can be easily removed, It is not always possible to get the whole\\r\\nmass away at once. Opening the carbuncle and giving free drainage afford\\r\\ngreat relief from the fever and often general symptoms. When the part\\r\\nfeels as if it needed redressing, it should be done, for it then gives\\r\\nmuch relief. The dressings frequently become hard and do not absorb all of\\r\\nthe material ready to be discharged. It is usually proper and prudent to\\r\\ndress a carbuncle two or three times a day. There is no danger if the one\\r\\nwho dresses it is clean with the instruments, hands and gauze or cotton.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLIVER SPOTS, Moth Patch, Chloasma, etc.--This is a discoloration of the\\r\\nskin of a yellowish to a blackish tint of varying size and shape.\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses.--It may be due to external agencies, such as rubbing, scratching,\\r\\nheat (tanning and sunburn) blistering; or due to diseases such as\\r\\ntuberculosis, cancer, malaria, Addison\\'s disease, disease of the womb,\\r\\npregnancy.\\r\\n\\r\\nPHYSICIANS\\' TREATMENT for Liver Spots.--Remove all causes if possible.\\r\\n\\r\\nLocal.--This must be carefully used, find out first how sensitive the skin\\r\\nis. Dr. Bulkley recommends this lotion:\\r\\n\\r\\n    Corrosive Sublimate       5 grains\\r\\n    Dilute Acetic Acid        2 drams\\r\\n    Borax                    40 grains\\r\\n    Rose water enough for     4 ounces\\r\\n\\r\\nShake bottle, mix and apply to the part night and morning. If the skin\\r\\nbecomes too scaly, a mild soothing ointment should be substituted for the\\r\\nabove. White suggests the following:\\r\\n\\r\\n    Hydrarg. Ammon.

Flesh Worms, Comedones, Pimples, etc.--This is a disorder of\\r\\nthe sebaceous glands in which the sebaceous (fatty, cheesy) secretions\\r\\nbecome thickened; the excreting ducts, appearing on the surface, as\\r\\nyellowish or blackish points. They appear chiefly on the face, neck,\\r\\nchest, and back and are very unsightly.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--They are easily pressed out, and appear then as thread-like,\\r\\nwhitish masses which contain fatty material. The black point may be due to\\r\\npigment or to dirt from without. Comedones may exist with acne and\\r\\nseborrhoea and excessive secretion of sebum.\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses.--Want of tone to the skin, which performs its functions\\r\\nsluggishly. Stomach-bowel disorders, menstrual disturbances and anemia are\\r\\nother causes and assist in making them worse. Improper care of the skin\\r\\nand dusty air may be other assistant causes.\\r\\n\\r\\n[62 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nMOTHERS\\' REMEDIES. For Pimples and Black-heads.--l.

The diet\\r\\nshould be like that given under dyspepsia and constipation. Menstrual\\r\\ndisorders should be remedied.\\r\\n\\r\\nLocal.--Remove the plugs (of sebum) and stimulate the skin glands. For\\r\\nthis purpose prolonged (ten minutes at a time) bathing of the face with\\r\\nhot water and soap; tincture of green soap in the more indolent, sluggish\\r\\ncases, should precede the pressing out of the blackheads: Lateral pressure\\r\\nwith the fingers or with the comedone extractor, especially contrived for\\r\\nthis purpose, will express the black-heads. After they are out, the skin\\r\\ndried and cleaned, various stimulating remedies can be applied in\\r\\nointments and lotions such as following:\\r\\n\\r\\n1.   \"Precipitated Sulphur       1 dram\\r\\n      Ointment of Rose water     1 ounce\\r\\n\\r\\nMix and rub on at night.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n2.

This is due to excessive\\r\\nheat upon the skin.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SKIN DISEASES 63]\\r\\n\\r\\nPHYSICIANS\\' TREATMENT for Inflammation of the Skin.--Relieve the pain;\\r\\nprotect the parts; exclude the air. Paint the burned part with a one to\\r\\nfive per cent solution of cocaine, according to the severity of\\r\\ninflammation. Then apply soothing lotions of equal parts of lime-water and\\r\\nolive or linseed oil; cover the whole with absorbent cotton. Dusting\\r\\npowder of soda bicarbonate may also be used, or common soda. In burns with\\r\\nvesicles, etc., open them and then cover with carbolized oil, gauze and\\r\\nadhesive to hold the dressing. The parts can be washed with a solution of\\r\\nboric acid, one teaspoonful to a cup of water; then dust upon the parts\\r\\nsugar of lead once or twice a day.

(Humid Tetter-Salt Rheum-Dry Tetter). Definition.--Eczema is an\\r\\ninflammatory disease of the skin, characterized at its commencement by\\r\\nredness, pimples, vesicles, pustules and their combinations, with itching\\r\\nand burning. It terminates in a watery or pus-like discharge with the\\r\\nformation of crusts or scaling.\\r\\n\\r\\nVarieties.--There are many varieties, red, scaly, fissured, watery looking\\r\\nand hard skin.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--Itching is almost always a symptom of this disease. There is\\r\\nmore or less pouring out of liquid (serum). The dry, scaly type, and the\\r\\nweeping type, may alternate with each other. There are six cardinal\\r\\nsymptoms; inflammation, itching, moisture, crusting, infiltration (liquid\\r\\nfilling of the tissues), fissuring or cracking. Dr. Fox says that nearly\\r\\none-third of all skin diseases are eczema in some of its stages or\\r\\nvarieties. In one kind there is red spot (macule). The skin is dry, of a\\r\\nbright or dull red color, with intense itching or burning, more or less\\r\\nwatery swelling in the acute stage. In the chronic stage, the skin becomes\\r\\nthick and covered with fine dry scales, usually in the face (Eczema\\r\\nErythematosum).\\r\\n\\r\\nEczema Vesiculosum. (Vesicular Eczema).--This is preceded by a feeling of\\r\\nheat and irritation about the part. In a short time pinhead sized vesicles\\r\\nappear. These frequently run together and form patches. They rupture\\r\\nrapidly; the liquid is poured out, dries up and forms crusts. The\\r\\ndischarge stiffens linen, a characteristic of this variety.\\r\\n\\r\\nEczema Pustulosum. (Pustules). Pustular Kind.--This is nearly like the\\r\\npreceding. The vesicles have pus in them from the start or develop from\\r\\nthe vesicles. When the pustules rupture, their contents dry up to the\\r\\nthick greenish-yellow crusts. The scalp and face, in children especially,\\r\\nare the favored spots for this kind. It occurs in poorly nourished\\r\\nchildren.\\r\\n\\r\\n[64 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nEczema Papulosum. (Papular Variety).--This is characterized by flat or\\r\\nsharp pointed reddish pimples (papules), varying in size from a small to a\\r\\nlarge pin-head. They are usually numerous, run or crowd together and form\\r\\nlarge patches. The itching is usually very intense. This causes much\\r\\nscratching, rawness and crusts. The pimples may continue as such, or\\r\\nchange into vesicles. In chronic cases they run together, and finally form\\r\\nthick scaly patches, and may run into a scaly eczema.\\r\\n\\r\\nEczema Rubrum (red).--The skin looks red, raw, and \"weeps.\"  It is most\\r\\ncommonly found about the face and scalp in children, and the lower parts\\r\\nof the legs in the old.\\r\\n\\r\\nEczema Squamosis. (Scaling).--This may follow any of the other varieties,\\r\\nbut usually follows the red and pimple (papule) variety. They are various\\r\\nsized and shaped reddish patches, which are dry and more or less scaly.\\r\\nThickening is always present, also a tendency to cracking of the skin,\\r\\nespecially if it affects the joints. There are other varieties but these\\r\\nare the most important.\\r\\n\\r\\nRECOVERY.--Eczema has a tendency to persist and rarely disappears\\r\\nspontaneously.\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses.--Gout, diabetes, rheumatism, Bright\\'s disease, dyspepsia,\\r\\nconstipation, nervous trouble, heat, cold, strong soaps, acids, alkalies,\\r\\nrubbing, scratching, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nMOTHERS\\' REMEDIES. 1. Eczema, Lemon or Vinegar for.--\"Rub the spots with\\r\\nsliced lemon. This will sometimes relieve the itching. Bathing with\\r\\nvinegar water is better for some as it destroys the germs.\" The bowels\\r\\nshould be kept open, and then constitutional faults removed as the\\r\\neruption of the skin is but a local manifestation of a functional fault.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Eczema, Olive Oil and Powder for.--\"Bathe with olive oil and sift over\\r\\nthe skin a powder composed of equal parts of fine laundry starch and oxide\\r\\nof zinc powder.\" Do not bathe with water until healed.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Eczema, Herb Tea for.--\"A good wash for eczema is made of an ounce of\\r\\nbruised blood-root and yellow dock, steeped well in a pint of alcohol, and\\r\\nhalf pint of vinegar.\" Apply gently to the affected parts.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Eczema, Potato and Camphor for.--\"Make a poultice of a cold potato with\\r\\na small quantity of camphor. This is very good and relieves the trouble\\r\\nvery soon.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n5.

In order to cleanse the parts use water softened by starch or bran.\\r\\nUse oily preparations to soften the crusts and then they can be removed\\r\\nwith water and good soap.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Chronic Sluggish Cases.--Water and strong soaps may be used. Cloths\\r\\nwrung from hot water and applied, will frequently relieve the itching. Use\\r\\nlotions in moist and salves in dry eczema. For the acute kind the remedy\\r\\nshould be soothing, and more or less stimulating for the chronic forms.\\r\\n\\r\\nLocal Treatment for the acute and sub-acute (between acute and chronic)\\r\\neczema.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn acute cases, with much pouring out of liquid (serum), lotions have a\\r\\ncooling effect.

Bathe the affected parts\\r\\nseveral times daily for fifteen or twenty minutes with this lotion and\\r\\napply oxide of zinc ointment afterwards.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Lead and Laudanum wash.--When the parts discharge moisture with burning\\r\\nfeeling, and are very sensitive the following is good:\\r\\n\\r\\n    Laudanum                      1/2 ounce\\r\\n    Solution of Sugar of lea    7-1/2 ounces\\r\\n\\r\\nMix and apply externally with gauze saturated with it.\\r\\n\\r\\n3.

Dusting powders.--Corn, potato or rice starch powders. Mennen\\'s baby\\r\\npowder is also good. Borated kind is the best for this.\\r\\n\\r\\n6. Oxide of Zinc ointment alone, applied night and morning, is valuable in\\r\\nmany cases.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Black wash should be used twice a day just before the oxide of zinc\\r\\nointment is applied. In other cases powdered oxide of zinc is dusted over\\r\\nthe part if the discharge is watery or profuse.\\r\\n\\r\\n7. McCall Anderson\\'s Ointment.--\\r\\n\\r\\n    Oxide of Bismuth   1 ounce\\r\\n    Pure Oleic Acid    8 ounces\\r\\n    White Wax          3 ounces\\r\\n    Vaselin            9 ounces\\r\\n    Oil of Rose        5 drops\\r\\n\\r\\nMake an ointment and apply.

I have given many different prescriptions, but those who treat\\r\\nskin diseases know that a great many are needed, for they act differently\\r\\nupon different persons.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpecial Varieties of Eczema and what to do for them.--\\r\\n\\r\\nEczema of Children.--This is generally acute of the vesicular (watery) or\\r\\nvesicular pustular (pus forming) variety. The parts commonly affected are\\r\\nthe scalp and the face.\\r\\n\\r\\nPHYSICIANS\\' TREATMENT for Eczema.--Remove the causes, watch the feeding.\\r\\nKeep the folds of the skin dry and free from friction. To prevent\\r\\nscratching, masks must be applied to the scalp and face, or the hands must\\r\\nbe tied in bad cases. The local treatment is the same as above except the\\r\\nstrength of the drugs used must be reduced in proper proportion.\\r\\n\\r\\nEczema of the Scalp, Milk Crust.--Remove the crusts by soaking the scalp\\r\\nwith some bland oil for twelve hours, followed by a shampoo, (the hair\\r\\nshould be cut in children) then the lotions and thin ointment (see above)\\r\\nshould be applied.\\r\\n\\r\\nEczema of the Face.--A mask of soft linen with holes cut out for the eyes,\\r\\nmouth and nostrils may be used.\\r\\n\\r\\nEczema of the Scrotum.--A well fitting suspensory should be worn, sponge\\r\\nthe parts with very hot water and follow with the anti-itching lotion and\\r\\ndusting powders for the itching.\\r\\n\\r\\nEczema of the Hands in Adults.--Keep the hands out of water as much as\\r\\npossible. Dry them thoroughly and then anoint. Greatly thickened patches\\r\\nmay be softened by soap plasters or bathe the parts in ten or twenty per\\r\\ncent solutions of caustic potash and followed by a salve application. The\\r\\ninternal treatment must be given for the cause.\\r\\n\\r\\nDiet in Eczema.--Avoid salty foods, such as salted fish or pork and corned\\r\\nbeef; greasy foods such as bacon and fried dishes; pastry and cheese.\\r\\n\\r\\n[68 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nMOTHERS\\' REMEDIES for Salt Rheum. 1. Alum Wash and Cathartic for.--\"Use\\r\\nan astringent wash as alum, tablespoonful in pint of water, and keep\\r\\nbowels opened by cooling medicines, as cream tartar, rochelle salts,\\r\\netc.\" The alum solution will be found very cooling and by keeping the\\r\\nbowels open you will carry off all the impurities thus cleansing the\\r\\nblood, which is one of the essential things to do in salt rheum.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Salt Rheum, Ammonia and Camphor for.--\"Apply ammonia and camphor to the\\r\\ncracks. Have used this successfully when everything else failed.\" Care\\r\\nshould be taken not to have the ammonia too strong, as it may irritate the\\r\\nskin more. If used properly, it is a good remedy.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Salt Rheum, Cactus Leaf Cure for.--\"From one large cactus leaf take out\\r\\nthe thorns, add one tablespoon of salt, three tablespoons lard, stew out\\r\\nslowly, and grease with this at night. Remarks:--This cured my hand that\\r\\nhad been in an awful condition for years.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Salt Rheum, Pine Tar for.--\"Apply pine tar as a paste.\" This is an\\r\\nexcellent remedy but care should be taken in using it, as pine tar is very\\r\\nirritating to some people, and should be used very cautiously.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBOIL. (Furunculus, Furuncle). Causes.--Boils may appear in a healthy\\r\\nperson, but they are often the result of a low condition of the system;\\r\\nthey are frequently seen in persons suffering from sugar diabetes.\\r\\n\\r\\nMOTHERS\\' REMEDIES. 1. Boil, My Mother\\'s Poultice for.--\"Poppy leaves\\r\\npounded up and bound on are good. My mother has used this recipe and found\\r\\nit to be good.\" This remedy not only makes a good poultice, but is very\\r\\nsoothing, as poppies contain opium. The leaves may be purchased at any\\r\\ndrug store.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Boil, Soap and Sugar Poultice for.--\"Poultice made of yellow or soft\\r\\nsoap and brown sugar, equal parts. Spread on cloth and apply faithfully.\"\\r\\nThis makes a good strong poultice, and has great drawing powers and would\\r\\nbe apt to create a good deal of pain, but would draw the boil to a head.\\r\\nThe above remedy was sent in by a number of mothers, all of whom said they\\r\\nhad tried it with success when other remedies failed.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Boil, Vinegar or Camphor for.--\"May be cured by bathing in strong\\r\\nvinegar frequently when they first start. When it stops smarting from the\\r\\nvinegar cover with vaseline or oil.\" Bathing the boil in vinegar seems to\\r\\ncheck the growth and does not allow them to become as large as they would\\r\\nordinarily. If you do not have vinegar in the house, camphor will answer\\r\\nthe same purpose.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Boil, Bean Leaf Poultice for.--\"Apply snap bean leaves, beat up fine.\"\\r\\nBruise the leaves so that they are real fine, and apply to the boil. This\\r\\nacts the same as a poultice.\\r\\n\\r\\n5. Boil, Another Vinegar Remedy for.--\"If taken at first a boil can be\\r\\ncured by dipping the finger in strong vinegar and holding on the boil\\r\\nuntil it stops smarting. Repeat three or four times then apply a little\\r\\noil to the head of boil.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n[SKIN DISEASES 69]\\r\\n\\r\\nPHYSICIANS\\' TREATMENT for Boils.--Tonics such as iron, quinine, and\\r\\nstrychnine are good. Elixir, iron, quinine and strychnine from a half to\\r\\none teaspoonful three times a day is a good tonic for an adult. Sulphide\\r\\nof calcium one-tenth grain four times a day is good. Paint the inflamed\\r\\nspot when it first begins, with a solution of gun cotton (collodion) and\\r\\nrenew it every hour until a heavy contractile coating is formed.\\r\\nPoultices, if used, should contain sweet oil and laudanum. Alcohol and\\r\\ncamphor applied over the skin in the early stages is recommended by\\r\\nRinger. This I know is good. Another, wipe the skin and use camphorated\\r\\noil. When boils occur in the external ear, the canal should be washed out\\r\\nwith hot water. If it is ripe it should be opened. The following is good\\r\\nfor the pain of a boil:\\r\\n\\r\\n    Iodoform      4 grains\\r\\n    Menthol       2 grains\\r\\n    Vaselin       1 dram\\r\\n\\r\\nMix and smear a cotton plug and insert in the ear two or three times a\\r\\nday.\\r\\n\\r\\nABSCESS.--An accumulation of pus (matter) in any part of the body.\\r\\n\\r\\nExternal Abscess.--Boil the knife, wash your hands in clean, hot, soapy\\r\\nwater. Wash the abscess and surrounding parts in hot water and good soap,\\r\\nand rinse off with alcohol, a salt solution, or listerine, etc. Then make\\r\\na good deep clean cut and scrape out if necessary. Dress with a clean\\r\\nlinen gauze or absorbent cotton, Poultices may be used if you are careful.\\r\\nSuch an abscess should be dressed twice a day. The inner dressing should\\r\\nbe soft and thick enough to absorb all the secretion given out between\\r\\ndressings.\\r\\n\\r\\nMOTHERS\\' REMEDIES. 1. Abscess, Beech Bark Poultice for.--\"Poultice made of\\r\\nred beech bark and wheat bran,\" A poultice made of the bark will cause a\\r\\ndrawing feeling, and the wheat bran will retain the heat. The proportions\\r\\nfor making the poultice should be about half and half.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Abscess, Milk and Salt Poultice for.--\"Make a poultice of one cup of\\r\\nhot milk and common salt three teaspoonfuls; salt added gradually so it\\r\\nwill not curdle. Cook until smooth and creamy, then add enough flour so it\\r\\nwill spread but not be dry. Divide this into four poultices and apply in\\r\\nsuccession every half hour. This will remove the soreness and it should be\\r\\nkept oiled until healed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Abscess, More Good Poultices for.--\"Take equal parts of rosin and\\r\\nsugar, mix well and apply for several days until the abscess is broken. If\\r\\nthis does not cause the abscess to break, poultice hourly with flaxseed\\r\\nmeal.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n[70 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nFELON. (Whitlow).--An inflammation of the deeper structures and frequently\\r\\nit is under the covering of the bone, (periosteum). If under the latter it\\r\\nmust be opened soon or the resulting pus will burrow and destroy bone,\\r\\njoints, etc. The pain is intense, and after the patient has passed one\\r\\nsleepless night walking the floor and holding his finger it should be\\r\\nopened.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow? Place the hand with the fingers extended with the palm up (it is\\r\\nusually under the finger or in the palm of the hand) upon the table; stand\\r\\nby the side of the arm. Attract the patient to something else; have a\\r\\ncurved two-edge knife ready and put the point, one-half inch, toward the\\r\\npalm, away from the felon part, press hard and the patient will jerk his\\r\\nhand and the cut will be made down to the bone, the membrane and tissues\\r\\nall opened freely, a vent given for the pus and in ten minutes very little\\r\\npain. Dress as for an abscess. If opened this way, it need not be\\r\\nreopened.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf in the Palm.--This needs a doctor, and must be opened with care. There\\r\\nare too many blood vessels to be careless there and one who understands it\\r\\nmust do it. Open a true felon early before it has time to destroy the\\r\\nbone.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSUPERFICIAL FELONS. Mothers\\' Remedies. 1. A Cure if Taken in Time.--\"If\\r\\ntaken in time a felon may be cured without lancing, but if poultice or\\r\\nliniment is used it is important that they should be bound on tightly as\\r\\nthe mechanical compression is more essential than the application. A good\\r\\nremedy is finely pulverized salt, wet with spirits of turpentine bound\\r\\ntightly and left two or three days, wetting with the turpentine when dry\\r\\nwithout removing the cloth.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Felon, Treatment until time to Lance.--\"If the felon has succeeded in\\r\\ngetting a good start and pains considerably, it is well to paint it with\\r\\niodine; in a few days it will become very painful, the pain being so\\r\\nintense that you cannot sleep. See a physician at once then, and have it\\r\\nlanced as the sac of pus on the bone must be opened. Then apply flaxseed\\r\\npoultices. Care should be taken not to have it lanced too early, as this\\r\\nis dangerous.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Felon, Strong Remedy for.--\"Turpentine, yellow of egg and salt, equal\\r\\nparts, bind on.\" This is very strong and should only be allowed to remain\\r\\non the finger a short time.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Felon, Lemon to draw inflammation from.--\"Take a lemon, make a little\\r\\nhole, put finger in it and hold there a number of hours.\" Lemons have a\\r\\ngreat many healing qualities in them, and seem to be very good for felons.\\r\\nThe acid in the lemon seems to help draw out the inflammation and serves\\r\\nas a poultice.\\r\\n\\r\\n5. Felon, Hot Water Cure for.--\"When you first feel it coming put the\\r\\nfinger in a cup of hot water, just so it does not blister, keep adding\\r\\nmore hot water as it cools for one hour. This has been tried several times\\r\\nand it has always stopped them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n6. Felon, Soap and Cornmeal Poultice for.--\"Poultice with soft soap and\\r\\ncornmeal. This never fails if taken in time.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n[SKIN DISEASES 71]\\r\\n\\r\\n7. Felon, Smartweed Poultice for.--\"Apply the bruised leaves of smartweed\\r\\nand bind on tight as can be borne.\" This makes a very good poultice\\r\\napplied in this way.\\r\\n\\r\\n8. Felon, Hot Application for.--\"When a felon first starts, soak the\\r\\nfinger in equal parts of alcohol and hot water; keep it as hot as the\\r\\nfinger will bear it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n9. Felon, an Old, Tried Remedy for.--\"Put wood ashes, covered with warm\\r\\nwater in a dish on the stove, hold the affected part in this, allowing it\\r\\nto get as hot as can be borne.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n10. Felon, Turpentine Cure for.--\"Soak the finger for one hour in\\r\\nturpentine. This has been known to cure a great many cases of felon.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n11. Felon, Weak Lye Application for.--\"Stick your finger in weak lye (can\\r\\nlye). Have water just as hot as you can stand your finger in. Hold it in\\r\\nas long as possible.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n12. Felon, Rock Salt and Turpentine for.--\"Rock salt dry and pounded fine.\\r\\nMix equal portions with turpentine. When dry change. This cured a felon on\\r\\nmy father.\" As much of our Canadian salt is rock salt, it is the most\\r\\ncommon salt to use.\\r\\n\\r\\nPHYSICIANS\\' TREATMENT for Superficial Felons.--Such may be averted\\r\\nperhaps. I have heard of that but have never seen it done. They are not\\r\\nthe genuine, true blue, terrible felons, but even these can give much\\r\\npain. They do not need such a deep opening, and they are not so dangerous\\r\\nto the structures. They are superficial and abscesses, perhaps, might be\\r\\nthe better term. For these many applications have been made.\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Some hold the finger in hot lye. That is a good poultice.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Yolk of an egg and salt (equal parts) make a salve as a drawer.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. The membrane within the shell of an egg is another good drawing remedy.\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Chase gives this definition of a felon in his first edition: \"This is\\r\\non one of the fingers, thumb or hand and is very painful. It is often\\r\\nsituated at the root of the nail.\" The latter is the kind, and also that\\r\\nof the structures above the covering of the bone that are eased by local\\r\\ntreatment. Especially the superficial, about the nail, etc. Steaming with\\r\\nherbs will do such good, or any hot poultice will do good. Dr. Chase says\\r\\nin another place, \"Whitlow resembles a felon, but it is not so deeply\\r\\nseated. It is often found around the nail. Immerse the finger in strong\\r\\nlye as long and as hot as can be borne several times a day.\" Such felons\\r\\nare curable by local treatment. I prefer the salt and yolk of the egg to\\r\\nthe lye. If you cannot stand this all the time, steam in the intervals\\r\\nwith strong herbs or use hot poultices, and then open when it points.\\r\\n\\r\\n[72 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nULCERS.

Definition.--This is an acute inflammatory\\r\\ndisease of the skin, characterized by groups of vesicles upon the inflamed\\r\\nbase, distributed along the course of one or more cutaneous (skin) nerves.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--The eruption is preceded by a great deal of neuralgic pain and\\r\\nis almost always one-sided. They first appear as red patches and upon\\r\\nthese patches vesicles soon develop (skin elevations with liquid in them);\\r\\nthese are separate, size of a pin-head to a coffee bean, swollen with a\\r\\nclear fluid, and clustered in groups of two to a dozen. They may dry up in\\r\\nthis stage, or they may fill with pus or run together, forming larger\\r\\npatches; new crops may appear, while the others fade. The vesicles rarely\\r\\nrupture of themselves, but dry into brownish crusts, which drop off\\r\\nleaving a temporary colored skin. It follows the course of a nerve. The\\r\\nmost common seat of this disease is over one or more intercostal (between\\r\\nthe rib) nerves, extending from the backbone to the breastbone. It also\\r\\noccurs along the side of the face and temple.\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses.--It is a self-limited disease, runs its course in a few weeks, of\\r\\nnervous origin and may be produced by exposure to weather changes, blows\\r\\nand certain poisons.\\r\\n\\r\\nMOTHERS\\' REMEDIES. Shingles, Herb Remedy for.--1. \"Make a solution of\\r\\nyerba rheuma, one ounce to a pint of boiling water, and apply freely to\\r\\nthe part several times a day.\" The yerba rheuma has an astringent action\\r\\nand contracts the tissues, relieving the inflammation of the skin. It also\\r\\nrelieves the itching.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SKIN DISEASES. 75]\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Shingles, Mercury Ointment for.--\"Apply night and morning an ointment\\r\\nfrom the oleate of mercury.\" This preparation will be found effective, but\\r\\ncare should be taken not to use too much of it, as oleate of mercury is\\r\\nvery powerful. It relieves the burning and itching.\\r\\n\\r\\nPHYSICIANS\\' TREATMENT for Shingles.--Protect the vesicles from rupture or\\r\\nirritation and relieve the pain. Paint the surface with a solution of gun\\r\\ncotton (collodion). Tonics to keep up the strength.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEXCESSIVE SWEATING. (Hyperidrosis).--This is a disorder of the sweat\\r\\nglands in which sweat is thrown out in excessive quantities.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--It may be great only in the armpit where it stains the\\r\\nclothing. When it comes on the hands and feet they may be wet, clammy and\\r\\nhave an offensive odor. They may be soaked, inflamed and painful.\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses.--The local forms may be due to a nervous condition; it is often\\r\\nthe result of general debility.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--General tonics are needed and those given under anemia, which\\r\\nsee. Applications for the local treatment.--Solution of alum applied to\\r\\nthe part will act as an astringent.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhite oak bark tea is good as anything. It should not be used so strong as\\r\\nto stop sweating entirely. Then follow it with dusting powders of starch\\r\\nor boric acid, containing salicylic acid (two to five per cent). When it\\r\\noccurs upon the feet use the Diachylon ointment. It must be made up fresh\\r\\nin a drug store. This is applied on strips of lint or muslin after the\\r\\nparts have been thoroughly washed and dried; it should be renewed twice\\r\\ndaily, the parts being dried with soft towels and then covered with\\r\\ndusting powder, followed by the ointment.\\r\\n\\r\\nFRECKLES. (Lentigo).--Freckles are an excessive deposit of pigment in the\\r\\nskin.\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses.--Exposure to the sun\\'s rays aggravates this condition.\\r\\n\\r\\nMOTHERS\\' REMEDIES for Freckles. 1.

(Naevus).--Mole is a congenital condition of the skin where there is\\r\\ntoo much pigment in a circumscribed place. It varies in size from a\\r\\npin-head to a pea or larger. The face, neck and back are their usual\\r\\nabiding place.\\r\\n\\r\\nPHYSICIANS\\' TREATMENT for Moles.--They should be removed by knife or by\\r\\nelectricity. The last is the best, especially for the hairy variety.\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses.--If they are subject to too much irritation they develop into\\r\\nmalignant growth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nENLARGED NAIL. (Onychauxis).--The nail may become too long, thick or wide.\\r\\nTreatment.--Remove the cause. Trim away the excessive nail tissue with a\\r\\nknife or scissors. In paronychia, inflammation around the nail, pieces of\\r\\nlint or cotton should be inserted between the edge of the nail and the\\r\\ninflamed parts, and wet solution of antiseptics, like listerine or salt\\r\\nwater, applied with cloths.\\r\\n\\r\\n[78 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nINFLAMMATION OF THE NAIL.

The inflammation is at the base (matrix) of the nail.\\r\\n\\r\\nLOUSE, Disease of the Skin Produced by.--This is a disease of the skin\\r\\nproduced by an animal parasite, the pediculus or louse. There are the head\\r\\nlouse, pediculus capitis; the body louse, pediculus corporis; the pubis,\\r\\n(about the genitals) pediculus pubis. The color of lice is white or gray.\\r\\nThey multiply very fast, the young being hatched out in about six days and\\r\\nwithin eighteen days are capable of propagating their same species. The\\r\\nnits are glued to the hair with a substance which is secreted by the\\r\\nfemale louse.\\r\\n\\r\\nHEAD LOUSE or Pediculus Capitis. Treatment.--The symptoms are very\\r\\napparent. Apply pure kerosene, rub it into the hair thoroughly. It can be\\r\\nmixed with an equal part of balsam of peru. It should be left on the scalp\\r\\nfor twelve to twenty-four hours and then removed by a shampoo. Other\\r\\nremedies that can be used are, tincture of staphisagria (stavesacre), this\\r\\ncan be made into an ointment; or ointment of ammoniated mercury. The dead\\r\\nnits are removed from the hair by dilute acetic acid or vinegar. Cutting\\r\\nthe hair is not usually required. An infusion of quassia is good as a\\r\\nwash.\\r\\n\\r\\nBody Louse or Clothes Louse (Pediculus Corporis).--This parasite lives in\\r\\nthe clothes. It is apt to be found in the folds or seams, especially where\\r\\nthe clothes come in close contact with the skin, as about the neck,\\r\\nshoulders and waist. This creature visits the body for its meal. They may\\r\\nproduce different kinds of skin troubles like eczema, boils, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nPHYSICIANS\\' TREATMENT for Lice.--Destroy the lice and their eggs (ova) by\\r\\nthoroughly baking or boiling the clothing. The irritated skin can be\\r\\nhealed by soothing applications like vaselin, and oxide of zinc.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Pediculus Pubis).--Lice on the hair of the pubis or about the genitals.\\r\\nThis is the smallest parasite of the three varieties, and it attaches\\r\\nitself firmly to the hair with its head buried in the follicular openings,\\r\\nand it is removed with great difficulty.\\r\\n\\r\\nPHYSICIANS\\' TREATMENT for Lice.--1. Ointment of mercury, blue ointment.\\r\\nThis is to be used frequently. It is rather unclean and may create a\\r\\nsevere inflammation so be careful of it.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Solution of corrosive sublimate, from one to four grains to one ounce\\r\\nof water. This is good and can be used once or twice a day; rub thoroughly\\r\\ninto the parts. It will cause redness and inflammation may follow if too\\r\\nmuch is used. It is very effective. Kerosene with an equal quantity of\\r\\nbalsam of peru is a good remedy.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SKIN DISEASES 79]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBLISTER DISEASE, (Pemphigus).--This is an acute or chronic skin disease in\\r\\nwhich there are blisters of various sizes and shapes, and these usually\\r\\noccur in crops.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--The disease may attack any part of the body. The blisters range\\r\\nfrom the size of a pea to a large egg. They contain at first a clear\\r\\nfluid, which soon becomes cloudy and looks more or less like pus. They\\r\\nlast several days and then dry up. They do not rupture of themselves very\\r\\noften. It is not catching.\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses.--These are obscure and not understood. A low state of the system\\r\\nis usually found.\\r\\n\\r\\nPHYSICIANS\\' TREATMENT for Blister Disease.--General treatment should be\\r\\ngiven. Arsenic is the best remedy and can be given in the form of Fowler\\'s\\r\\nsolution, five drops after meals at the beginning far an adult. This\\r\\nshould be increased until some  poisonous symptoms, such as bloating in\\r\\nthe face is produced.\\r\\n\\r\\nElixir Quinine, Iron and Strychnine is good as a tonic, one teaspoonful\\r\\nafter meals. Regulate the diet, give nourishing and easily digested food.\\r\\n\\r\\nLocal Treatment.--Puncture the blisters. Then put on a mild ointment like\\r\\nvaselin; bran and starch baths can be given in some cases. The length of\\r\\nthe time of the disease is uncertain.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE ITCH DISEASE. (Psoriasis) (not Common Itch). Definition.--This is a\\r\\nchronic inflammatory disease of the skin, in which there appear upon the\\r\\nskin thick, adherent, overlapping, scales of a shiny, whitish color, and\\r\\nthese are situated upon a reddish, slightly raised and sharply outlined\\r\\n(defined) base.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--They begin as small reddish spots, sharply defined against the\\r\\nhealthy skin. They may be elevated slightly and soon became covered with\\r\\nwhitish pearl colored scales. If the scales are picked off, there is left\\r\\na smooth red surface, and from this, small drops of blood ooze out. No\\r\\nwatery or pus-like discharge escapes at any period of this disease. These\\r\\nspots extend at the circumference (periphery), reaching the size of the\\r\\ndrops, or of the coins, or they may run together and form ring-shaped, or\\r\\ncrooked wavy lines of patches, with a center that is healing up. A few\\r\\nscattered spots may be present, or large areas may be involved. In rare\\r\\ncases the whole skin is affected. These spots or patches may occur an any\\r\\npart of the body, but involve the extending part of the limbs, especially\\r\\nthe elbows and knees. There may be slight itching present at times.\\r\\n\\r\\nCourse of the Disease.--It is chronic; patches may continue indefinitely\\r\\nor they may disappear in one place, while new crops appear elsewhere. This\\r\\ndisease usually appears far the first time between the ages of ten and\\r\\nfifteen; it may then return at various intervals during a lifetime. It is\\r\\nusually worse during the winter.\\r\\n\\r\\n[80 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES.]\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses.--Are usually unknown, it may occur in all classes and kinds of\\r\\npeople.\\r\\n\\r\\nPHYSICIANS\\' TREATMENT for Itch Disease.--Remedies for the general symptoms\\r\\nare demanded. The general health must be looked after. Stimulating foods\\r\\nand drinks and the use of tobacco are forbidden.\\r\\n\\r\\nArsenic in the form of Fowler\\'s solution from three to ten drops three\\r\\ntimes a day; or the arsenious acid in pills of 1/50 of a grain three times\\r\\na day. This medicine must not be used in the acute form, but only in\\r\\nchronic cases.\\r\\n\\r\\nLocal Treatment.--1. Remove the scales first and follow this by\\r\\nstimulating applications unless there is much inflammation. In such cases\\r\\nsoothing lotions should be applied. Dr. Schalek of New York, recommends\\r\\nthe following:\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Remove the scales thoroughly with hot water and soap and then apply:\\r\\n\\r\\n    Chrysarobin       1 dram\\r\\n    Ether, Alcohol    Equal parts of each and enough\\r\\n                         to dissolve the first remedy\\r\\n    Collodion         1 ounce\\r\\n\\r\\nMix and apply with a brush to the parts affected.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis solution may cause inflammation and great swelling, and on that\\r\\naccount it should not be used on the face, it stains the skin. Dr. Hare\\r\\nrecommends a bath only before the application. In that way some scales\\r\\nremain and there is not so much inflammation and swelling resulting. The\\r\\nstain can be removed with a weak solution of chlorinated lime.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Tar Remedy.--Tar is also a good remedy in ointment forms. The skin\\r\\nshould be closely watched to find out how sensitive it is to the tar\\'s\\r\\naction, not only in this but in all skin diseases. Drugs should be changed\\r\\noccasionally, for they lose their efficiency.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Tar and Sulphur Remedy for.--Never use tar on the face, it stains.\\r\\n\\r\\n    Ointment of Tar      1 ounce\\r\\n    Ointment of Sulphur  1 ounce\\r\\n\\r\\nMix thoroughly and apply at night.\\r\\n\\r\\n5.

Another good local application. It is composed of the following\\r\\ningredients:\\r\\n\\r\\n    Resorcinol            1 dram\\r\\n    Zinc Oxide            1 dram\\r\\n    Rose Water Ointment  10 drams\\r\\n\\r\\nApply twice a day to the part affected.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter mixing the ointment heat it until the resorcinol crystals melt to\\r\\nprevent any irritation of the skin from them.\\r\\n\\r\\n    Ichthyol           2-1/2 drams\\r\\n    Salicylic Acid     2-1/2 drams\\r\\n    Pyrogallic Acid    2-1/2 drams\\r\\n    Olive Oil              1 ounce\\r\\n    Lanoline               1 ounce\\r\\n\\r\\nMix thoroughly and apply.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe result of the disease is always favorable as to life and general\\r\\nhealth. It yields to treatment, but it has a tendency to recur.\\r\\n\\r\\nITCH. Common Itch (Scabies).--Itch is a contagious disease, due to the\\r\\npresence of an animal parasite. There is intense itching in this disease.\\r\\nThe parasite seeks the thin, tender regions of the skin, the spaces\\r\\nbetween the fingers, wrists and forearms, the folds in the arm-pit, the\\r\\ngenitals in men and the breasts in women.\\r\\n\\r\\nCause.--It is always transmitted by contagion. An intimate and long\\r\\ncontact is usually needed. A person occupying the same bed with one who\\r\\nhas it is liable to take it. The female parasite lives from six to eight\\r\\nweeks, during which time she lays fifty eggs, which, when hatched out,\\r\\nbecome impregnated in their turn.\\r\\n\\r\\nMOTHERS\\' TREATMENT for Common Itch. 1. Mustard Ointment for.--\"Make an\\r\\nointment of cup of fresh lard (without salt) and a tablespoonful of dry\\r\\nmustard, work to cream and apply.\" This is very soothing.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Itch, Grandmother\\'s Cure for.--\"Sulphur and lard mixed; rub on at\\r\\nnight, then take a good bath, using plenty of soap, every day.\" The above\\r\\ningredients are always easily obtained and anyone suffering with this\\r\\ndisease will find relief from the itching by using this remedy. It is very\\r\\nsoothing.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Itch, Herb Ointment for.--\"Mix the juice of scabious with fresh lard\\r\\nand apply as an ointment. A decoction made from the same herb might be\\r\\ntaken at the same time to purify the blood. It is always well to take some\\r\\nblood tonic together with any outward application you may use.\" Some who\\r\\nread the above may know scabious by other names as the \"morning bride\" or\\r\\n\"sweet scabious\" or \"devil\\'s bit,\" etc.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Itch, Elecampane Root Ointment for.--\"Boil elecampane root in vinegar,\\r\\nmix with fresh lard, beating thoroughly.\" This is an excellent remedy for\\r\\nitch, having a very soothing effect and relieving the itching.\\r\\n\\r\\n[82 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\n5. Itch, Oatmeal for.--\"A poultice of oatmeal and oil of bays; cures the\\r\\nitch and hard swellings.\" Oatmeal poultices are more stimulating and draw\\r\\nmore rapidly than those made of linseed meal.\\r\\n\\r\\n6. Itch, a Mother at Parma, Michigan, Sends the Following.--\"Make a salve\\r\\nof sulphur and lard and each night apply it to the whole body; also one\\r\\ntablespoonful internally for three mornings, then skip three and so on.\\r\\nThis is the only thing I know of that will cure itch. I have tried it with\\r\\nsuccess.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n7. Itch, Kerosene for.--\"Apply kerosene oil, undiluted, to the parts\\r\\nseveral times a day.

Sift it into the melted cosmoline and\\r\\nstir until nearly cool, then add napthaline and oil bergamot. Stir until\\r\\ncool.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPHYSICIANS\\' TREATMENT for Itch.--If the skin is much inflamed or\\r\\nirritable, soothing baths and ointments should be used at first. There are\\r\\nthree indications to be met in the treatment; first, to destroy the cause,\\r\\nthe parasite; second, to cure the result of their work; third, to prevent\\r\\na return or transmission to others.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst Thing to Do.--Soak the body thoroughly with soap (green soap if you\\r\\nhave it) and water, this softens the outer layer (epidermis). This layer\\r\\ncovers the female parasite which burrows under it. The male does not\\r\\nburrow and it is therefore easier to kill. Rub the skin thoroughly with a\\r\\nrough towel after the soaking. This rubbing will remove the outer skin\\r\\nscales and with it some of the parasites. The towel should be boiled at\\r\\nonce to prevent it from conveying the parasite to others. Then apply the\\r\\nointment, which, if thoroughly applied, relieves the patient at once. The\\r\\nskin should be well softened and rubbed in order to open every track\\r\\n(burrow) of the parasite. Allow the ointment to remain on all night and\\r\\nuse it for three or four nights successively.\\r\\n\\r\\nOintments.--1. Simple sulphur ointment alone.\\r\\n\\r\\n2.   Oil of Cale (from Juniper)   1 dram\\r\\n     Sulphur Ointment             2 drams\\r\\n     Lanolin                      5 drams\\r\\n\\r\\n3.

This is not so strong.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SKIN DISEASES 83]\\r\\n\\r\\n4. For children the following can be used:\\r\\n\\r\\n    Sulphur       1 dram\\r\\n    Balsam Peru   1 dram\\r\\n    Lard          1 ounce\\r\\n\\r\\nApply as usual.\\r\\n\\r\\n5.

It is easily cured with proper\\r\\ntreatment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDANDRUFF (Seborrhoea).--The scurfs or scales (dandruff) upon the scalp are\\r\\nformed from seborrhoea.\\r\\n\\r\\nDefinition.--The word seborrboea means to flow suet or fatty fluids.\\r\\nSeborrhoea is a functional disorder of the sebaceous gland (fatty, suet\\r\\nmatter) and this secretion is somewhat altered in character.\\r\\n\\r\\nVarieties.--There are three varieties. These depend upon the character of\\r\\nthe material excreted.\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Oily seborrhoea (seborrhoea oleosa).\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Dry seborrhoea (seborrhoea sicca).\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Mixed type of both.\\r\\n\\r\\nOily seborrhoea.--Symptoms.--This appears most frequently upon the nose\\r\\nand forehead and sometimes upon the scalp. The skin looks oily,\\r\\nglistening, with the appearance of dust adhering to it. Small drops of oil\\r\\nare seen to ooze out of the follicles and when wiped off it reforms at\\r\\nonce. The ducts of the follicles appear gaping or they are plugged with\\r\\nblack-heads (comedones). The hair is rendered unusually oily, when it\\r\\nappears on the scalp, and it is especially noticeable on bald heads. It is\\r\\nvery common in the negro, almost natural or physiological.\\r\\n\\r\\nDry Seborrhoea.--This is a more common form and occurs upon the hairy or\\r\\nnon-hairy parts, but chiefly upon the scalp (dandruff). The affected\\r\\nparts are covered with grayish, greasy scales, which are easily dislodged,\\r\\nthe skin underneath is oily and slate gray in color. This type of the\\r\\ndisease forms one type of dandruff.

The\\r\\nremedies should be thoroughly rubbed in and applied in the form of\\r\\nointments or lotions and used once daily. Cutting the hair may be\\r\\nnecessary. The odor of sulphur may be overcome by the use of perfume. If\\r\\nthe scalp becomes too dry after shampooing some oil should first be\\r\\napplied, whatever application is used afterwards.\\r\\n\\r\\nRemedies.--Resorcin, sulphur, salicylic acid, in combination with other\\r\\ningredients. Some favorite prescriptions are now given:\\r\\n\\r\\n1.  Resorcin           1 to 2 drams\\r\\n    Pure Castor Oil         1 dram\\r\\n    Alcohol                 2 ounces\\r\\n\\r\\n    Mix and rub well into the scalp.\\r\\n\\r\\n2.

The disease is\\r\\nvery obstinate, but generally gets well.\\r\\n\\r\\nWEN (Sebaceous Cyst. Steatoma).--A wen varies in size from a millet seed\\r\\nto an egg, and it is due to the distention of a sebaceous gland by its\\r\\nretained secretions. They occur most commonly on the scalp, face and back.\\r\\nThey cause no pain, grow slowly, and after they have grown to a certain\\r\\nsize remain stationary for an indefinite time. Sometimes they become\\r\\ninflamed and ulcerate.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--Make a free cut and take the mass out. Its covering (capsule)\\r\\nor sac must be removed at the same time, for if any of this membrane\\r\\n(capsule) is left it will fill up again. Equal parts of fine salt and the\\r\\nyolk of an egg beaten together and applied continuously will eat the skin\\r\\nopen and the mass can then be taken out. This is quite painful and takes\\r\\nseveral days, while with the knife there is little pain if cocaine is\\r\\ninjected and it will all be over in a few minutes.\\r\\n\\r\\n[86 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nRINGWORM (Tinea Trichophytina).--Ringworm is a contagious disease of the\\r\\nskin, produced by the presence of a vegetable parasite. The disease\\r\\naffects the hair follicles of the scalp and the beard, and also of the\\r\\nportions of the body that, seemingly at least, have no hair.\\r\\n\\r\\nVarieties.--Ringworm affecting the body called Tinea Circinata. Ringworm\\r\\naffecting the scalp called Tinea Tonsurans. Ringworm affecting the beard,\\r\\netc., Tinea Barbae (barbers\\' itch).\\r\\n\\r\\nRingworm of the Body.--This type of ringworm usually begins as one or\\r\\nseveral round, somewhat raised and very small, defined congested spots and\\r\\nthese are covered with a few branny scales. The disease extends from the\\r\\ncircumference and, while healing in the center, assumes a shape like a\\r\\nring and these rings may become as large as a silver dollar and remain the\\r\\nsame size for months or years, or they may go together (coalesce) to form\\r\\ncircle (gyrate) patches. Vesicle and pimples frequently crop out at the\\r\\ncircumference.\\r\\n\\r\\nMothers\\' Remedies for Ringworm.--1. Gunpowder and Vinegar for.--\"Make a\\r\\npaste of gunpowder and vinegar and apply. Sometimes one application will\\r\\nbe sufficient; if not, repeat.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Ringworm, Cigar Ashes for.--\"Wet the sore and cover with cigar ashes.\\r\\nRepeat frequently. This will cure if taken in time.\" This is a very simple\\r\\nand effective remedy. Cigar ashes are always easy to obtain and if applied\\r\\nto the ringworm at the very beginning, the nicotine in the tobacco will\\r\\ndraw out the soreness and relieve the inflammation.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Ringworm, Kerosene for.--\"Apply kerosene with the finger or a cloth\\r\\nseveral times a day.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Ringworm, Ontario Mother Cured Boy of.--\"Wash head with vinegar and\\r\\npaint with iodine to kill germ. Cured a neighbor\\'s boy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n5. Ringworm, Another from a Mother at Valdosta, Georgia.--\"Burdock root\\r\\nand vinegar.\" Take the dock root and steep it the same as any ordinary\\r\\nherb tea, then add your vinegar, making the proportions about half and\\r\\nhalf. Apply this to the affected part.\\r\\n\\r\\n6. Ringworm, Egg Skin Remedy for.--\"Take the inner skin of an egg and wrap\\r\\naround it, and cover with a piece of cloth.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n7. Ringworm, from a Mother at Owosso. Michigan.--\"Take gunpowder and wet\\r\\nit and put it on the sores,\" This remedy has been tried a great many times\\r\\nand always gives relief when taken right at the beginning. So many people\\r\\nwill wait, thinking the ringworm will disappear of its own accord, instead\\r\\nof giving some simple home remedy like the above a trial.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SKIN DISEASES 87]\\r\\n\\r\\nPHYSICIANS\\' TREATMENT for Ringworm.--1. For infants and children simpler\\r\\nremedies should be used at first. Scrub each patch with tincture of green\\r\\nsoap, or merely good soap and water may be employed. Then apply tincture\\r\\nof iodine to the patches, once or twice a day, enough to irritate the\\r\\npatches. Dilute acetic acid, or dilute carbolic acid will do the same\\r\\nwork. A ten per cent solution of sodium hyposulphite is a good remedy\\r\\nalso.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Corrosive sublimate, one to four grains to the ounce of water, is very\\r\\ngood to put on the patches. For children the strength should be about\\r\\none-half grain to the ounce.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Ammoniated mercury is also very good to put on. Sometimes a combination\\r\\nof remedies will do better, as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n    Milk of Sulphur        2-1/2 drams\\r\\n    Spirits of Green Soap       6 drams\\r\\n    Tincture of Lavender        6 drams\\r\\n    Glycerin                  1/2 dram\\r\\n\\r\\n4.

Separate the child affected. Cleanse the diseased\\r\\nparts from time to time by shampooing with a strong soap. The hair over\\r\\nthe whole scalp should be clipped short and the affected parts shaved, or\\r\\nif allowed, the hairs in the affected parts pulled out. The remedies are\\r\\nthen applied if possible in the shape of ointments, which are thoroughly\\r\\nrubbed in. Vaselin and lanolin are better as a base for the medicine, as\\r\\nthey penetrate deeper. Following remedies are the most valuable:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Carbolic acid, one to two drams to glycerin one ounce.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Oleate of mercury, strength ten to twenty per cent.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Sulphur Ointment, ten to twenty per cent strength.\\r\\n\\r\\n4.

Have found this to be the best of\\r\\nanything ever used for barber\\'s itch.\" This remedy will be found very good\\r\\nif the case is not very severe. If the face is covered with sores, filled\\r\\nwith pus and of long standing a stronger treatment should be used. See\\r\\nother Mothers\\' Remedies, also Doctors\\' Treatment.\\r\\n\\r\\n5. Barber\\'s Itch, Cuticura Ointment for.--\"Apply cuticura ointment to the\\r\\nsores, and as it draws out the water press a clean cloth against the sore\\r\\nto absorb the water. This will generally draw the water out in three or\\r\\nfour days.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPHYSICIANS\\' TREATMENT for Barber\\'s Itch.--Pulling out the hairs or close\\r\\nshaving every day. Keep the affected parts soaking with olive oil for two\\r\\nsuccessive days. The evening of the third day the shampoo is employed, the\\r\\nskin is washed free from crusts and scales, shave cleanly. After shaving\\r\\nbathe the parts for ten minutes with borated water, as hot as can be\\r\\nborne; while this is being done, all pustules or points where there is a\\r\\nmucous fluid coming out to the surface are opened with a clean needle.\\r\\nSponge freely over the affected surface with a strong solution of\\r\\nhyposulphite of sodium for several minutes and not allow it to dry; this\\r\\nsolution may contain one dram and perhaps more to the ounce. After a\\r\\nthorough and final washing with hot water, the tender skin is carefully\\r\\ndried and gently smeared with a sulphur ointment containing one to two\\r\\ndrams of sulphur to the ounce of vaselin, often with the addition of from\\r\\none-quarter to one-half grain of mercuric sulphide. In the morning wash\\r\\nthe ointment off with soap and water, the sodium solution is reapplied and\\r\\na borated or salicylated powder is thoroughly dusted and kept over the\\r\\nparts during the day and apply ointment at night. The shaving must be\\r\\nrepeated at least the next day. As soon as there are no pustules (lumps),\\r\\nor they have diminished in size, the ointment at night is superseded by\\r\\nthe use of the dusting powder. The washing with very hot water and with\\r\\nthe solution hyposulphite is continued nightly, when the inflammation\\r\\nexcited by the parasite is limited to the follicles that are invaded.\\r\\nContinue the dusting powder after the ointment is discontinued.\\r\\n\\r\\n[SKIN DISEASES 89]\\r\\n\\r\\nWART (Verucca).

I was called as a\\r\\nneighbor and found the foot swollen to twice its natural size, and the man\\r\\nin pain from head to foot. I ordered cabbage leaves steamed until wilted,\\r\\nthen put them over the limb from knee to foot and covered with a cloth. In\\r\\nabout fifteen minutes they were black, so we removed them and put on fresh\\r\\nones, repeating the change until the leaves did not turn black. Then the\\r\\nsore was thoroughly cleansed with a weak solution of saleratus and while\\r\\nwet was thickly covered with common black pepper and wrapped up. The\\r\\nsaleratus water and pepper was changed night and morning until the sore\\r\\nwas entirely healed. After the third day this man had no pain, and in four\\r\\nweeks was entirely healed.

In the meantime to relieve the local conditions keep\\r\\nthe mouth clean and use as a mouth wash boric acid, one teaspoonful to a\\r\\ncup of warm water.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Burnt alum applied directly to the part is good.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Nitrate of silver pencil applied directly to the canker until it turns\\r\\nwhitish, cures in a few applications. Use twice a day.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. A wash of sage tea is good also, but it must be strong.\\r\\n\\r\\n5. The juice of a ripe tomato is good applied locally. Sore mouth should\\r\\nbe kept absolutely clean. Thrush frequently comes from uncleanness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGANGRENOUS STOMATITIS.--This is a rapidly spreading gangrenous affection\\r\\nof the cheeks and forms a rare occurrence and ending fatally in most\\r\\ncases. The trouble may extend to the jaws and lips.\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses.--It is more common in girls and boys and usually appears between\\r\\nthe ages of two and five years. It is worse in the low countries like\\r\\nHolland, but it is not contagious. It is more likely to attack the sickly\\r\\nchildren suffering from the effects of overcrowding. It may follow\\r\\ndiseases like scarlet fever, typhoid fever, smallpox, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--It usually affects first the mucous membrane of one cheek, near\\r\\nthe corner of the mouth, as a dark, ragged, sloughing ulcer and spreads\\r\\nfor two or three days before the substance of the cheek is infected. If\\r\\nyou grasp the cheek between the thumb and finger you can then feel a hard\\r\\nand sensitive lump. The cheek may be eaten through by the third day,\\r\\nthough a week generally passes before this happens. There is a burning\\r\\nwatery discharge from the unhealthy wound. The breath smells terribly and\\r\\nit is almost unbearable. The gangrene may spread over one half of the face\\r\\nof the side affected.\\r\\n\\r\\nTREATMENT.--The death rate is eighty to ninety per cent. This is a very\\r\\ndangerous disease and a doctor must be in attendance. Cut, away all the\\r\\ndead tissue by using burning caustics, such as fuming nitric acid, solid\\r\\nzinc chloride, nitrate of silver, carbolic acid on the actual canker.\\r\\nSometimes mild applications like sub nitrate of bismuth, chloride of\\r\\npotash or the following do well:--\\r\\n\\r\\n    Sulphate of copper        2 drams\\r\\n    Powdered cinchona       1/2 ounce\\r\\n    Water enough to make      4 ounces\\r\\n\\r\\nMix and apply. Peroxide of hydrogen is good as a disinfectant or boric\\r\\nacid solution, etc., may be used. Keep up the patient\\'s strength.\\r\\n\\r\\nFortunately this disease is rare. I have never seen a case in practice.\\r\\n\\r\\nSalivation.--Stop the mercury, keep the bowels open and use the same\\r\\nantiseptic washes as directed for sore mouth.\\r\\n\\r\\n[100 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nChlorate of Potash Solution, Soda Solutions, Boracic Acid\\r\\nSolutions.--Brush the ulcers with nitrate of silver sticks.

It may be acute or chronic. When acute it may be called acute\\r\\ngastritis, acute gastric catarrh, acute dyspepsia or acute indigestion.\\r\\nWhen chronic it may be called chronic gastritis, chronic catarrh of the\\r\\nstomach, chronic dyspepsia or chronic indigestion.\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses.--This is a very common complaint and is usually caused by eating\\r\\nfoods that are hard to digest, which either themselves irritate the\\r\\nstomach, or remain undigested, decompose, and so excite an acute\\r\\ndyspepsia, or indigestion, or it may be caused by eating or taking in more\\r\\nthan the stomach can digest. A frequent cause is eating decomposing food,\\r\\nparticularly in hot weather. Alcohol is another great cause.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--In mild cases. Distress in the stomach, headache, weary\\r\\nfeeling, thirst, nausea, belching of wind, sour food, and vomiting; the\\r\\ntongue is heavily coated and the saliva increased. In children there are\\r\\nloose bowels and colicky pains. It lasts rarely more than twenty-four\\r\\nhours. Vomiting usually relieves the patient.\\r\\n\\r\\nSevere cases.--These may set in with a chill; fever 102 or 103. The\\r\\ntongue is much coated, breath foul and frequent vomiting, loss of\\r\\nappetite, great thirst, tenderness in region of the stomach; repeated\\r\\nvomiting of food at first, then of bile stained fluid with mucus;\\r\\nconstipation or diarrhea. Attacks last one to five days.\\r\\n\\r\\nMOTHERS\\' REMEDIES.--1. Indigestion or Dyspepsia, Mustard and Molasses\\r\\nfor.--\"Mustard is an excellent household remedy kept in every home. A\\r\\ntablespoonful of white mustard mingled with two ounces of molasses and\\r\\nthen taken once a day will act gently on the bowels and is a beneficial\\r\\nremedy in dyspepsia.\" By acting upon the bowels it relieves the stomach of\\r\\nany food that may have caused a disturbance and relieves the dyspepsia.\\r\\n\\r\\n2.

A cupful in the morning will strengthen the digestive\\r\\norgans, a teacupful in which is stirred a large dessert spoonful of moist\\r\\nsugar and a little grated ginger is an excellent thing to give to aged\\r\\npersons a couple of hours before dinner,\" It is remarkable to see how this\\r\\ntreatment aids the digestion, especially in chronic cases. It may also be\\r\\ngiven to fretful children in small doses.\\r\\n\\r\\nPHYSICIANS\\' TREATMENT in mild cases of acute Dyspepsia.--These recover by\\r\\nthemselves by giving the stomach rest, and taking a dose of castor oil.\\r\\nHot water is good to help to clean out the stomach.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment in severe forms.--Promote vomiting by drinking large amount of\\r\\nwarm water. This cleans the stomach of the sour, foul, decomposing food.\\r\\nIf warm water does not cause vomiting, give any simple emetic you may have\\r\\nat your hand, such as mustard, etc., one teaspoonful. If the stomach\\r\\ntastes very sour, take some baking soda; subnitrate of bismuth (ten\\r\\ngrains) is good, if you have it. If the bowels are constipated you should\\r\\ntake an enema (injection) or salts. Soda water can be drank freely. Rest\\r\\nthe stomach for a day from food. For the thirst cracked ice is relished.\\r\\nAs the patient is usually very thirsty the mouth should be rinsed\\r\\nfrequently with cool water and some can be swallowed. As stated before for\\r\\nnausea and sour belching, baking soda or bismuth subnitrate can be used\\r\\nwhen there is much gas, sour belchings; crust coffee is very good.

It has been coming on gradually for some time and the\\r\\nwarnings have not been heeded; The appetite is variable, sometimes good\\r\\nand often poor. Among the early symptoms are feelings of distress or\\r\\noppression after eating, and they may amount to actual pain; great or\\r\\nsmall. Sometimes feels sick at the stomach, belching of gas and bitter\\r\\nliquids and vomiting of food immediately after eating or some hours later.\\r\\nStomach tender and painful to the touch.

Heat whisky and wet the\\r\\npoultice with it, then apply to the stomach and bowels.\" This will always\\r\\ngive relief. Wetting the poultice with whisky will be found very\\r\\nbeneficial as it will retain the heat longer.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Stomach Trouble, Oil of Hemlock for,--\"The Oil of Hemlock is a superior\\r\\nremedy in gastric irritation of the stomach. Dose:--One to two drops in\\r\\nsweetened water every ten or twenty minutes until relief is afforded, for\\r\\nan adult.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Cramps in Stomach, Ginger and Soda for.--\"One teaspoonful of ginger\\r\\nstirred in half glass of hot water in which a half teaspoonful of baking\\r\\nsoda has been dissolved.\" The ginger is very beneficial, as it warms up\\r\\nthe stomach and thereby relieves the cramps, and the baking soda relieves\\r\\nany gas in the stomach that may be causing the trouble.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Cramps in Stomach, Oil of Peppermint for.--\"Put a few drops of\\r\\npeppermint in a glass of warm water. Take a teaspoonful every few minutes\\r\\nuntil relieved.\" This is an old time-tried remedy our grandmothers used to\\r\\nuse and can be relied upon.\\r\\n\\r\\n5.

Pains in Stomach, Hot Plate for.--\"Hot plate laid on stomach. Use the\\r\\nheavy English made plates, common to us in Canada, as they will hold heat\\r\\nlonger.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n[DIGESTIVE ORGANS 105]\\r\\n\\r\\nPHYSICIANS\\' TREATMENT for Chronic Gastritis.--Most cases can be cured if\\r\\nthe patient is willing to do the proper thing in eating and drinking and\\r\\nregulating the habits. It takes time to cure such cases, and plenty of\\r\\ngrit and courage and \"stick\" on the patient\\'s part. Remember it has been a\\r\\nlong time coming, longer than it will be going if the patient does right.\\r\\nDiet and habits must be corrected. You cannot help the trouble if you put\\r\\ninto the stomach what has caused it. We eat too much fat and too much\\r\\nimproper and improperly cooked foods, our bread, etc., is half baked.\\r\\nGravies are rich and greasy, everything is highly seasoned, very much like\\r\\nthe life we lead.\\r\\n\\r\\nDiet.--A regular time for eating and no eating between meals. Do not eat\\r\\ntoo much or too fast, or anything that you know disagrees with you. Fried\\r\\nfoods are generally harmful, pies, cakes, hot breads, strong tea and\\r\\ncoffee and alcohol, gravy and highly spiced foods; vinegar pickles,\\r\\npreserves, etc., are generally bad. If there is acid belching gas on\\r\\nstomach, the starch foods should be restricted, particularly potatoes and\\r\\nthe coarser vegetables. Potatoes fried in lard or butter are always bad\\r\\nunless you are a hard physical worker. Dr. Osler, England, says breads,\\r\\npancakes, pies, and tarts, with heavy pastry and fried articles of all\\r\\nsorts, should be strictly prohibited. As a rule, white bread toasted is\\r\\nmore readily digested than bread made from the whole meal. Sometimes\\r\\ngraham bread is better. Sugar and very sweet articles of food should be\\r\\nused in great moderation or avoided altogether. Ice cream frequently\\r\\naggravates it. Soda water is a great dyspepsia producer. Fats, except a\\r\\nlittle good butter, very fat meats, and thick greasy soups and gravies\\r\\nshould be avoided.\\r\\n\\r\\nRipe fruits are good in some cases. Bananas generally are not digested.\\r\\nBerries are frequently harmful. Milk is splendid diet for some people.\\r\\n\\r\\nCautions.--The bowels must be kept \"moving\" every day, try to do it by\\r\\ndieting, rubbing the abdomen and exercise. Bathing the abdomen in cool\\r\\nwater is good. Go to the closet at a regular time every day and try to\\r\\nhave a passage, as this helps. Never put off going to stool when nature\\r\\ncalls. Dyspepsia is frequently made worse by constipation. Seek good\\r\\ncheerful company. Do not worry over your condition. By care and diet you\\r\\nwill soon be all right.\\r\\n\\r\\nHome Treatment.--1. Drink a glass of cold water an hour before breakfast,\\r\\nor hot water if it agrees better with you.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Do not eat much meat.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. If the stomach wants tone, bitter tonics, like quassia, gentian,\\r\\ncardanum are good, even if drank as teas. When the tongue is coated with a\\r\\nwhite thick fur, golden seal is good. Medicines are not as essential as\\r\\ncare and diet.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Charcoal in small doses is good for\\' a \"gassy\" stomach.\\r\\n\\r\\n5. If a bitter tonic is needed the following is good:\\r\\n\\r\\n    Bicarbonate of Soda                            1 dram\\r\\n    Tincture of Nux Vomica                    l to 2 drams\\r\\n    Compound tincture of Gentian, enough for       3 ounces\\r\\n\\r\\nMix and take one teaspoonful to a dessert spoonful before meals.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[106 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNERVOUS DYSPEPSIA.--This is acquired from over work, worry, excitement,\\r\\nhurried or irregular meals, or inherited. It shows itself in all sorts of\\r\\nsymptoms and they must be met as they come. Diet the same as for general\\r\\ndyspepsia, never eat when you are tired, rest after eating.\\r\\n\\r\\nULCER OF THE STOMACH AND DUODENUM (Upper part of bowel).--Round or\\r\\nperforating ulcer. The stomach ulcer is most common in women of twenty or\\r\\nthirty; servant girls, shoemakers, and tailors are frequently attacked.\\r\\nUlcer of the duodenum is usually in males and may follow large superficial\\r\\nburns. The ulcer in the stomach is usually situated near the pylorus (small\\r\\nend) and in the first portion of the duodenum.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--Pain, local tenderness, vomiting and bleeding. These may not\\r\\nshow until perforation or bleeding occurs. Distress after eating, often\\r\\nnausea and vomiting of very acid fluid, loss of weight and lack of blood.\\r\\n\\r\\nPain in the region of the stomach and the back is the most constant\\r\\nsymptom. It is usually sharp, increased at once by food, relieved by\\r\\nvomiting. The tender spot can be located. Bleeding occurs in about\\r\\none-half the cases and is usually profuse, bright red and fluid; if\\r\\nretained in the stomach the blood becomes clotted and brown. Tar-like\\r\\nstools when there is blood in the bowels. They usually recover under\\r\\ntreatment, but may recur.\\r\\n\\r\\nPHYSICIANS\\' TREATMENT FOR ULCER OF THE STOMACH.--1.

This must be done early;\\r\\neven this may not cure but it, at least, prolongs life and makes the\\r\\npatient more comfortable while life does last. In the line of medicine the\\r\\nonly thing to do is to give only such remedies as will ease the symptoms.\\r\\n\\r\\nDiet.--Attend to this also and you will save pain and distress. Every case\\r\\nshould be treated as it needs and no special directions can be given here.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBLEEDING FROM THE STOMACH.--(Haematemesis).\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses.--Cancer and ulcer of the stomach are main causes of excessive\\r\\nbleeding; poisons also cause it; injuries also.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--The vomited blood may be fluid or clotted; it is usually of\\r\\ndark color. The longer it remains in the stomach the darker it becomes.\\r\\nThere may be great weakness and faint feeling on attempting to rise before\\r\\na vomiting of blood. The contents of the bowels when passed look \"tarry.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPHYSICIANS\\' TREATMENT for Bleeding of the Stomach.--Absolute rest in bed\\r\\nis necessary. The bowels should be moved by an enema and it can be\\r\\nrepeated carefully as often as necessary. Cracked ice in bag over the\\r\\nstomach. If the patient vomits much medicine is useless. They generally\\r\\nrecover with rest. The extremities can be bandaged if there is great\\r\\nweakness and also external heat can be applied if there is a tendency to\\r\\nfaintness.\\r\\n\\r\\nCaution.--A person so afflicted, if he has ulcer, must be careful of his\\r\\ndiet for months after an attack. He should be careful not to lift, over\\r\\nwork, over eat or worry.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNEURALGIA OF THE STOMACH (Cardialgia, Gastralgia, Gastrodynia).--\\r\\nThis is a severe pain in paroxysms in the region of the stomach.\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses.--The patients are of a nervous type. They may have anemia,\\r\\nexhaustion from sickness and bleedings, the menstruation be at fault.\\r\\nGrief, worry and anxiety.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--The attack comes suddenly as a rule. The pains are agonizing in\\r\\nthe stomach region, they may dart to the back or pass around the lower\\r\\nribs. The attack lasts from a few minutes to an hour or two. It does not\\r\\ndepend upon the food taken.\\r\\n\\r\\nPHYSICIANS\\' TREATMENT for Neuralgia of the Stomach.--The causes should be\\r\\nunderstood and especial treatment given for them. The patients are usually\\r\\nrun down and a tonic treatment is needed. Constipation and menstrual\\r\\ntroubles should be cured, worry, trouble and anxiety, if possible, be\\r\\nremoved. The following is good for nervous patients:--\\r\\n\\r\\n    Valerianate of zinc       18 grains\\r\\n    Valerianate of quinine    18 grains\\r\\n    Iron Arsenate              2 grains\\r\\n\\r\\n    Mix and make into eighteen pills and take one after meals.\\r\\n\\r\\n[108 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nBitter tonics can be taken such as gentian, columbo, quassia.

If a bright child loses interest in things and has\\r\\ndiarrhea something is wrong. The two essential features are vomiting and\\r\\ndiarrhea, and the vomiting is persistent. First it vomits food, then the\\r\\nmucus and bile. The thirst is great, but anything taken to relieve it is\\r\\ninstantly thrown up. The stools are frequent, large and watery. They may\\r\\nbe painless and involuntary. They may look like dirty water, but later\\r\\nthey loose all color. They are sometimes so thin and copious as to soak\\r\\nthrough the napkin and saturate the bed. They may be without odor, and\\r\\nagain the odor is almost over-powering. The prostration is great and\\r\\nrapid. The fontannelles, openings in the head, are depressed, the face\\r\\nbecomes pale and pinched, and the eyes are sunken. It occurs usually\\r\\nduring the summer months, oftener in babies under eighteen months and\\r\\nstill more under a year old.\\r\\n\\r\\nCautions.--This book will probably find its way into homes many miles from\\r\\na drug store and possibly a long distance from a physician. Should a child\\r\\nin that home show symptoms of cholera infantum it would be imperative for\\r\\nthat mother to begin at once home treatments. We, therefore, give below a\\r\\nnumber of remedies which a mother can either prepare in her home or can\\r\\ntake the precaution to have filled at some convenient time and keep\\r\\nconstantly at hand, properly labeled so she can turn to them at any\\r\\nmoment. On the other hand, should you have to wait even three or four\\r\\nhours for a physician begin one of the treatments below until he comes;\\r\\nyou may save the child\\'s life by doing so. Cholera infantum and pneumonia\\r\\nclaim so many of our little ones each year, and in many cases snatch them\\r\\naway within a few hours of the first noticeable symptoms that we must\\r\\nadvise you to call a physician as soon as you suspect it is serious. Cases\\r\\nvary and only a trained eye can detect the little symptoms and changes\\r\\nthat may weigh in the balance the life of baby.\\r\\n\\r\\nMOTHERS\\' REMEDIES for Cholera Infantum.--l. Castor oil and warm\\r\\napplications for.--\"Give the child one teaspoonful of castor oil, then\\r\\nwring woolen cloths out of warm whisky and apply to the abdomen. This will\\r\\nmost always give relief, especially after the castor oil has acted upon\\r\\nthe bowels.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Cholera Infantum, First Thing to Do.--\"The first thing to do is to give\\r\\na teaspoonful of castor oil, so as to thoroughly clean out the bowels.\\r\\nThen add one tablespoonful of turpentine to one quart of hot water and\\r\\nwring cloths out of this and apply to the bowels to relieve the pain that\\r\\nis always present in this disease. The turpentine is especially good for\\r\\nthe bowels when they are bloated and have much gas in them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Cholera Infantum, White of Egg and Cathartic for.--\"One teaspoonful\\r\\ncastor oil every two hours, until the movements are natural. Give no food\\r\\nexcept albumen water, which is composed of the white of one egg (slightly\\r\\nbeaten) and a small pinch of salt in a glass of cold water which has been\\r\\npreviously boiled. Feed this by spoonfuls.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n4.

If continued this will\\r\\ncompletely cure.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n5. Cholera Infantum, Spice and Whisky Poultice for.--\"Take all kinds of\\r\\nground spices, make a poultice. Heat whisky and wet the poultice. Apply to\\r\\nthe stomach and bowels.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n[114 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\n6. Cholera Infantum, Cabbage Leaf Poultice for.--\"Take a cabbage leaf,\\r\\nhold it over the stove until warm as can be stood on back of hand; lay it\\r\\nacross the child\\'s abdomen. Repeat if necessary.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n7. Cholera Infantum, Herb Remedy for.--\"Strawberry root, blackberry root\\r\\nand raspberry root, equal parts, steeped together. I have used this remedy\\r\\nand found it good, but it should be used in time.\" Make a tea of these\\r\\nroots and take one teaspoonful every hour until relieved. This is a mild\\r\\nastringent.\\r\\n\\r\\n8. Cholera Infantum, Tomatoes Will Relieve.--\"Make a syrup of peeled\\r\\ntomatoes well sweetened with white sugar. Give one teaspoonful every half\\r\\nhour.\" This syrup is very soothing and the tomatoes are especially good if\\r\\nthere is some ulcerated condition of the bowels. This preparation should\\r\\nalways be strained before using.\\r\\n\\r\\n9. Cholera Infantum, Injection for.--\"For infant one year old inject into\\r\\nthe bowels one pint of thin starch, in which is mixed from three to five\\r\\ndrops of laudanum; cool, repeat night and morning. Plenty of water or cold\\r\\nbarley water may be given and the food for a time may consist of egg\\r\\nalbumen with a few drops of brandy. When the symptoms first appear apply a\\r\\nspice plaster or hot application over the abdomen; and keep child as quiet\\r\\nas possible.\" This is a remedy recommended and used by a number of\\r\\nphysicians and has cured many severe cases.\\r\\n\\r\\nDiets and Drinks.--Stop ordinary feeding at once. A little cream and\\r\\nwater, or barley water and cream may do. If the breast milk excites the\\r\\nstomach and the bowels, stop it for a few hours. You can give a few drops\\r\\nof raw beef juice or a little brandy and water. To satisfy the thirst,\\r\\nwrap up a small bit of ice in a linen cloth and let the baby mouth it.\\r\\nDilute the milk or stop entirely and give only water, or lime water and\\r\\nmilk, barley water. Give all the water the child can drink boiled and\\r\\ncooled.\\r\\n\\r\\nPHYSICIANS\\' TREATMENT for Cholera Infantum.--1. Washing out of the bowel\\r\\nfrequently by injection controls the diarrhea. Use water of a temperature\\r\\nof 107. Elevate the tube about two feet above the bed, use one-half pint\\r\\nat one time. As the half pint flows in disconnect the funnel attached to\\r\\nthe tube and the contents of the bowel are allowed to escape. Then allow\\r\\nanother one-half pint to flow in. Some may escape and this is not an\\r\\nunfavorable sign. Keep on until a quart is given. This treatment is to\\r\\nwash and clean out the gut and stimulate the heart. The salt solution\\r\\nshould be used, if necessary. Give only two daily.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. For Vomiting.--Wash out the stomach through a tube or by giving a great\\r\\ndeal of water.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Subcarbonate of bismuth for the vomiting and straining; two or three\\r\\ngrains in powder every two or three hours. If there is much colicky pain,\\r\\nadd one-half grain of salol to the bismuth powder.\\r\\n\\r\\n[DIGESTIVE ORGANS 115]\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Castor oil; one teaspoonful may be needed if the bowels have any fecal\\r\\nmatter in them.\\r\\n\\r\\n5. Mustard poultice or spice poultice on the belly is useful.\\r\\n\\r\\nVomiting.--This is simply a symptom; many diseases cause it, as scarlet\\r\\nfever, tuberculosis, meningitis, acute dyspepsia, biliousness, chronic\\r\\ndyspepsia, indigestion, neuralgia of the bowels, appendicitis, ulcer and\\r\\ncancer of the stomach, pregnancy, etc. Many persons with dyspepsia vomit\\r\\ntheir food.\\r\\n\\r\\nMOTHERS\\' REMEDIES for Vomiting.--1. Spice Poultice to Stop.--\"Make a\\r\\npoultice of one-half cup of flour and one teaspoonful of each kind of\\r\\nground spice, wet with alcohol or whisky. Apply over the stomach.\" This\\r\\nacts as a counter irritant and has the same action on the system as a\\r\\nmustard plaster, only not so severe and can be left on for hours, as there\\r\\nneed be no fear of blistering. This kind of a poultice should always be\\r\\nused when it is necessary to leave one on any length of time.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Vomiting, Mustard Plaster to Stop.--\"Plaster of mustard on pit of\\r\\nstomach.\" Be very careful not to allow the plaster to remain on too long,\\r\\nas it will blister, and this would be worse to contend with than the\\r\\nvomiting.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Vomiting, Parched Corn Drink to Stop.--\"Take field corn and parch it as\\r\\nbrown as you can get it without burning. When parched throw in boiling\\r\\nwater and drink the water as often as necessary until vomiting is\\r\\nstopped.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Vomiting, Peppermint Leaves Application for.--\"Bruise peppermint leaves\\r\\nand apply to the stomach.\" This can be found in any drug store in a powder\\r\\nform, and is easily prepared by crushing the leaves and applying to the\\r\\nstomach. If you have the essence of peppermint in the house, that will\\r\\nanswer about the same purpose taken internally and rubbed over abdomen.\\r\\n\\r\\n5. Vomiting, to Produce, Mustard and Water for.--\"To produce vomiting take\\r\\ntwo tablespoonfuls dry mustard, throw luke warm water over it and let\\r\\nstand a minute, then drink.\" This is an old, tried remedy that we all know\\r\\nabout.\\r\\n\\r\\n6. Vomiting, to Produce, Warm Water for.--\"Drink a quart of warm water and\\r\\nyou will easily find relief at once.\" The warm water remedy is very good\\r\\nas the water helps the patient by removing all decomposed food.\\r\\n\\r\\nPHYSICIANS\\' TREATMENT for Vomiting.--The only way to treat it is to treat\\r\\nthe disease that causes it. Here I may mention a very simple remedy; a tea\\r\\nmade from wood soot is frequently helpful. It is the creosote in the wood\\r\\nsoot that gives it its medical virtue.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. For nervous vomiting; two to five drops of garlic juice is good. Dose\\r\\nof syrup for a child [is] one teaspoonful. Dose of syrup for an adult is\\r\\nfour teaspoonfuls.\\r\\n\\r\\n[116  MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\n3. A little brandy on cracked ice is often good.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Oil of cloves, one-half to one drop, helps in some cases.\\r\\n\\r\\n5. Lime water added to milk is good in babies.\\r\\n\\r\\n6. Vinegar fumes, saturate a cloth and inhale the fumes.\\r\\n\\r\\n7. Seidlitz powder often settles the stomach, soda also.\\r\\n\\r\\n8. Mustard plaster over the stomach is good in all cases.\\r\\n\\r\\n9. One-tenth of a drop of ipecac is good for nausea and vomiting.\\r\\n\\r\\n10. One-half of a drop of Fowler\\'s solution every two hours is useful in\\r\\nnausea following a spree. So also one drop dose of nux vomica every half\\r\\nhour.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAPPENDICITIS.--Inflammation of the vermiform appendix is the most\\r\\nimportant of acute bowel troubles. Sometimes the appendix may contain a\\r\\nmould of feces, which can be squeezed out readily. Sometimes foreign\\r\\nbodies like pins are found there; in about seven per cent of cases foreign\\r\\nbodies are found.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is a disease of young persons. Fifty per cent occur before the\\r\\ntwentieth year. It is most common in males. Persons who do heavy lifting\\r\\nare quite subject to the disease. Some cases follow falls or blows.\\r\\nIndiscretions of diet are very apt to bring on an attack, particularly in\\r\\nthose who have had it before. Pain in the appendix in such persons,\\r\\nfrequently follows the eating of food hard to digest. Gorging with peanuts\\r\\nis also a cause.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--In a large proportion of cases the following symptoms are\\r\\npresent:--Sudden pain in the abdomen, usually referred to the right groin\\r\\nregion. Fever often of moderate form or grade. Disturbances of the stomach\\r\\nand bowels, such as nausea, vomiting and frequently constipation.\\r\\nTenderness or pain in the appendix region. The pain in fully one-half of\\r\\nthe cases is localized in right lower part of the abdomen, but it may be\\r\\nin the central portion, scattered, or in any part of the abdomen. Even\\r\\nwhen the pain is not in the region of the appendix at first, it is usually\\r\\nfelt there within thirty-six or forty-eight hours. It is sometimes very\\r\\nsharp and colic-like; sometimes it is dull. The fever follows rapidly upon\\r\\nthe pain. It may range from 100 to 102 and higher. The tongue is coated\\r\\nand moist usually,--seldom dry. Nausea and vomiting are commonly present.\\r\\nIt rarely persists longer than the second day in favorable cases.\\r\\nConstipation is the rule, but the attack may start with diarrhea.\\r\\n\\r\\nLocal Signs.--Tenderness of the rectus muscle (to the right of the centre\\r\\nof the abdomen) and tenderness or pain on deep pressure. The muscle may be\\r\\nso rigid that a satisfactory examination cannot be made. Sometimes there\\r\\nis a hardness or swelling in the appendix region. Tenderness, rigidity and\\r\\nactual pain on deep pressure; with the majority of cases, a lump or\\r\\nswelling in the region of the appendix.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Vermiform Appendix.\\r\\nWhen Affected by Inflamation and Gangrene\\r\\nNecessitating an Operation.]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Vermiform Appendix.\\r\\nShowing Different Types.]\\r\\n\\r\\n[DIGESTIVE ORGANS 117]\\r\\n\\r\\nRecovery.--Recovery is the rule. It frequently returns. General\\r\\nperitonitis may be caused by direct perforation of the appendix and death\\r\\nin appendicitis is usually due to peritonitis.\\r\\n\\r\\nSurgeons have declared that sudden pain in the region of the appendix,\\r\\nwith fever and localized tenderness, with or without a lump almost without\\r\\nexception means appendix disease. Rest in bed, take measures to allay the\\r\\npain; ice bag applied to the part is very effective.\\r\\n\\r\\nOperation.--Dr. Osler, of Oxford, England, says.--\"Operation is indicated\\r\\nin all cases of acute inflammatory trouble in this region, whether the\\r\\nlump is present or not, when the general symptoms are severe, and when by\\r\\nthe third day the features of the case points to a progressive (condition)\\r\\nlesion. An operation after an acute attack has disappeared is not fraught\\r\\nwith much danger.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDiet.--All food should be withheld for a few days if possible. Liquids,\\r\\nsuch as egg albumen, weak tea, thin broth, barley or rice water, or milk\\r\\ndiluted with lime water may be given in small quantities if necessary.\\r\\nWhen the acute symptoms have subsided, milk may be taken undiluted, and\\r\\neggs may be added to the broth. When the pain and fever have disappeared\\r\\nentirely, gruels made of rice or barley, soft-boiled egg, scraped beef,\\r\\nstewed chicken, toast, and crackers may be added to the list; still later,\\r\\nmashed potatoes and vegetables, finely divided and strained, may be\\r\\nallowed and, finally, when well, usual diet resumed.\\r\\n\\r\\nAPPENDICITIS, Mothers\\' Remedies.--Home Treatment Found Good for.--\"To\\r\\nallay the pain and stop the formation of pus in appendicitis it is\\r\\nrecommended that a flannel cloth be saturated with hot water, wrung out,\\r\\ndrop ten to fifteen drops of turpentine on it and apply to the affected\\r\\nparts as hot as the patient can bear. Repeat until relief is obtained.\\r\\nThen cover the bowels with a thin cotton cloth, upon which place another\\r\\ncloth wrung out of kerosene oil. This sustains the relief and conduces to\\r\\nrest and eventual cure. It is an essential part of the absorbent cure for\\r\\nappendicitis, and since its adoption doctors do not resort to a surgical\\r\\noperation half so often.\" The above is a standard remedy and will most\\r\\nalways give relief.\\r\\n\\r\\nPHYSICIANS\\' TREATMENT for Appendicitis.--The bowels should at first be\\r\\nmoved by an enema, The patient should be perfectly quiet in bed. The\\r\\nice-bag should be applied to the part, but wrapped in flannel and flannel\\r\\nalso on the skin, It must not be allowed to make the flesh too cool. This\\r\\ncoolness relieves the inflammation of the part. Small doses, from\\r\\none-tenth to one drop, of aconite can be given for the fever and\\r\\ninflammation the first twenty-four hours. Dose every one to three hours.\\r\\nBut little medicine is now given in appendicitis.\\r\\n\\r\\n[118 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nCaution.--Keep the bowels regular, especially if you have ever had\\r\\nappendicitis before, also be careful of your eating. This disease will\\r\\nattack high livers, hearty eaters and those with constipated bowels more\\r\\nquickly than others.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nINFLAMMATION OF THE BOWELS. Mothers\\' Remedies.--1.--Inflammation of the\\r\\nBowels, Excellent Remedy for.--\"First bathe the abdomen with warm salt\\r\\nwater, then lay over the navel a piece of lard the size of black walnut.\\r\\nHold the hand over this until it softens; then rub well into the bowels.\\r\\nThis often relieves when pills and powders fail.\" The massaging brings\\r\\nabout action of the bowels without a cathartic usually. Sweet oil or olive\\r\\noil instead of lard, will do as well.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Inflammation of the Bowels, Red Beet Poultice for.--\"Take red beets;\\r\\nchop up, put in bag, warm a little and put across the stomach. This will\\r\\ndraw out the inflammation quickly and makes a very good poultice.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Inflammation of the Bowels, Hop Poultice for.--\"Take hops, strain them\\r\\nand put in a sack. Lay across the stomach and bowels.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Inflammation of the Bowels, Griddle Cake Poultice for.--\"Apply hot\\r\\ngriddle cakes on bowels. This acts as a poultice, and should be replaced\\r\\nas soon as cold.\" This remedy saved my life when I was seventeen years of\\r\\nage. Am now fifty. This remedy will be found very good, but care should be\\r\\ntaken not to burn the patient.\\r\\n\\r\\n5. Cold or Pain in the Bowels, Spice Poultice for Child or Adult.--\"Take a\\r\\ncloth sack large enough to cover abdomen; take all kinds of ground spices,\\r\\nput in the bag and tie up, sprinkle bag lightly with alcohol, just enough\\r\\nto dampen spices; lay this on abdomen.\" This serves as a poultice and is\\r\\nan excellent remedy for this trouble. This may be used for a child as well\\r\\nas an adult.\\r\\n\\r\\n6. Inflammation of the Bowels, Simple Remedy Always at Hand for.--\"Apply\\r\\nhot woolen cloths to abdomen as hot as can be wrung out, change every few\\r\\nminutes. My life was saved twice when I was several hundred miles from a\\r\\ndoctor by this treatment.\" This simple but never failing remedy is easily\\r\\nprepared and, as we all know, heat is the most essential thing for this\\r\\ntrouble, especially moist heat.\\r\\n\\r\\n7. Inflammation of the Bowels, a Rather Unique Remedy for.--\"Cut the head\\r\\noff of a hen, cut open down the breast, take out the inwards, pound flat\\r\\nand roll with rolling pin and apply to the bowels. This will draw out all\\r\\ninflammation, but must be done in as little time as possible.\" The above\\r\\nremedy can do no harm. Many people use it. Perhaps other poultices would\\r\\nbe easier to prepare, just as effective and save the hen.\\r\\n\\r\\n8. Inflammation of the Bowels, Marshmallow Leaves, a Canadian Remedy\\r\\nfor.--\"Green marshmallow leaves (dry will do). Wet flannel and apply\\r\\nhot.\" Make a strong tea of the marshmallow leaves and while hot dip\\r\\nflannels and apply to abdomen.\\r\\n\\r\\n[DIGESTIVE ORGANS 119]\\r\\n\\r\\n9.

Excellent in bowel complaint in one-half dram (one-half\\r\\nteaspoonful) doses every hour until it operates.\" The rhubarb moves the\\r\\nbowels and casts out all irritating matter. The oil of cloves stimulates\\r\\nthe membranes of the bowels and the cinnamon and nutmeg are astringents.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMOTHERS\\' REMEDIES for Toothache, Dry Salt and Alum for.--1. \"Equal parts.\\r\\nTake common salt and alum. Mix and pulverize these together, wet a small\\r\\npiece of cotton and cause the mixture to adhere to it and place in the\\r\\nhollow tooth. At first a sensation of coldness will be produced, which\\r\\nwill gradually disappear, as will the toothache. This is an excellent\\r\\nremedy and should be given a trial by any person suffering with this\\r\\ntrouble.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Toothache, Oil of Cloves Quick Relief for.--\"If the tooth has a cavity\\r\\ntake a small piece of cotton and saturate with oil of cloves and place in\\r\\ntooth, or you may rub the gum with oil of sassafras.\" These are both good\\r\\nremedies, and will often give relief almost instantly.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Toothache, Home-Made Poultice for.--\"Make a poultice of a slice of\\r\\ntoast, saturate in alcohol and sprinkle with pepper and apply externally.\\r\\nThis will give almost instant relief.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n4.

Aching tooth needs\\r\\nthe care of a dentist. It pays to retain your natural teeth in good shape.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nINTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION.--Causes.--This may be caused by strangulation,\\r\\ntelescope (intussusception) of the bowels, twists and knots, strictures\\r\\nand tumors, abnormal contents.\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Strangulation is the most frequent cause; this is caused by adhesions\\r\\nand bands from former peritonitis, or following operations. The\\r\\nstrangulation may be recent and due to adhesion of the bowels to the\\r\\nabdominal cut or wound, or a coil of the bowel may be caught between the\\r\\npedicle of a tumor and the wall of the pelvis. These cases are rather\\r\\ncommon after some operations.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Intussusception.--This means that one portion of the bowel slips into\\r\\nan adjacent portion. These two portions make a cylindrical lump varying in\\r\\nlength from one-half inch to a foot or more. Irregular worm-like motion of\\r\\nthe bowel is a cause of intussusception.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Twists and knots.--Most frequent between thirty and forty. (There is an\\r\\nunusually long mesentery.)\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Strictures and tumors.--These are not very important causes.\\r\\n\\r\\n5. Abnormal contents.--Fruit stones, coins, pins, needles, false teeth,\\r\\nround worms rolled in a mass. Coins rarely cause inconvenience.\\r\\n\\r\\n[122 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms of Acute Obstruction.--Constipation, pain in the bowels, and\\r\\nvomiting are the three most important symptoms. Pain sets in early, and\\r\\nmay come on abruptly when walking or more commonly when working. It is at\\r\\nfirst colicky, but soon becomes continuous and very intense, vomiting soon\\r\\nfollows and is constant and very distressing. First the stomach contents\\r\\nare vomited, and the greenish bile-stained material, and soon the material\\r\\nvomited is a brownish-black liquid, with a bowel odor. This peculiar\\r\\nvomiting is a very characteristic symptom. Constipation may be absolute,\\r\\nwithout the discharge of either feces or gas. Very often the contents of\\r\\nthe bowel below the obstruction are discharged. The abdomen is usually\\r\\ndistended and when the large bowel is involved this is extreme. If it is\\r\\nhigh up in the small intestine, it may be very slight. At first, the\\r\\nabdomen is not tender, but later it becomes very sensitive and tender. The\\r\\nface is pale and anxious and finally collapse symptoms intervene. The eyes\\r\\nare sunken, the features look pinched and a cold, clammy sweat covers the\\r\\nskin. The pulse becomes rapid and weak. There may be no fever, and it may\\r\\ngo below normal. The tongue is dry, parched, and the thirst is incessant.\\r\\n\\r\\nRecovery.--The case terminates as a rule in death in three to six days,\\r\\nif aid is not given.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--Purgatives should not be given. For the pain, hypodermics of\\r\\nmorphine are needed. Wash out the stomach for distressing vomiting. This\\r\\ncan be done three to four times a day. Thorough washing out of the large\\r\\nbowel with injections should be practised, the warm water being allowed to\\r\\nflow in from a fountain syringe and the amount carefully estimated.\\r\\nHutchinson recommends that the patient be placed under an anesthetic, the\\r\\nabdomen kneaded, and a copious enema given with the hips placed high or\\r\\npatient in inverted position. Then the patient should be thoroughly\\r\\nshaken, first with the abdomen held downward and subsequently in the\\r\\ninverted position. If this and similar measures do not succeed by the\\r\\nthird day surgical measures must be resorted to.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor bloating, turpentine cloths should be used, and other hot, moist\\r\\napplications.\\r\\n\\r\\nDiet.--Should be very light, if any, for a day or so.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRUPTURE (Hernia).--Hernia means a protrusion of an organ from its natural\\r\\ncavity, through normal or artificial openings in the surrounding\\r\\nstructures. But by the term hernia, used alone, we mean the protrusion of\\r\\na portion of the abdominal contents through the walls, and that is known\\r\\nby the popular term of \"rupture.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n[DIGESTIVE ORGANS 123]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most common forms of rupture protrude through one of the natural\\r\\nopenings or weak spots in the abdominal walls, as for instance, the\\r\\ninguinal (groin) and femoral canals. The femoral canal is located at the\\r\\nupper and inner part of the thigh, and this place is a seat of rupture,\\r\\nespecially in women. Rupture may also occur at the navel, when it is\\r\\ncalled umbilical hernia or rupture. The contents of a hernia are bowel and\\r\\nomentum (a covering of the bowel) separately or together. The bowel\\r\\ninvolved in a rupture is usually the lower portion of the small bowel, but\\r\\nthe large bowel is sometimes affected. A sac covers the bowel or omentum\\r\\nin a rupture. This sac consists of the protruded portion of peritoneum,\\r\\nwhich has been gradually pushed through one of the canals (inguinal or\\r\\nfemoral) or of the process of peritoneum, which has been carried down by\\r\\nthe testicle in its descent, and the connection of which with the\\r\\nperitoneum of the abdomen still continues, not having been obliterated, as\\r\\nit usually is before birth. The former is called an acquired rupture sac;\\r\\nthe latter is a congenital rupture sac, and it is found only in groin\\r\\n(inguinal rupture).\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses.--Rupture is more common in men than in women. It may occur at any\\r\\ntime of life. The majority of cases occur before middle age, and the\\r\\nlargest number during the first ten years of life, owing to the want of\\r\\nclosure of the peritoneum which is carried down by the testicles before\\r\\nbirth. Rupture is most frequently strangulated between the ages of forty\\r\\nand fifty.\\r\\n\\r\\nLocation.--The great majority of cases of rupture are groin or inguinal\\r\\nrupture.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--A fullness or a swelling is first noticed in the groin, which\\r\\nis made worse in standing, coughing and lifting. This disappears on lying\\r\\ndown and reappears on rising in many cases, even at first; coughing makes\\r\\nthe lump or swelling harder. It may come on both sides, when it is called\\r\\ndouble rupture or hernia.\\r\\n\\r\\nMOTHERS\\' REMEDIES.--Rupture, Poultice for.--\"Take equal parts of lobelia\\r\\nand stramonium leaves; make a poultice and apply to the parts. Renew as\\r\\noften as necessary. This combination makes a very effective poultice and\\r\\nis sure to give relief.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPHYSICIANS\\' TREATMENT.--A person should wear a truss (support) that fits\\r\\nperfectly, and this should not cause any pain or discomfort. The truss\\r\\nshould be worn all day, taken off at night after going to bed and put on\\r\\nbefore rising, when still lying down. If it is put on after rising a\\r\\nlittle of the gut may be in the canal and pressed down by the support.\\r\\nThere are many kinds of supports.\\r\\n\\r\\nOperations now performed for rupture are very successful if the patient\\r\\ntakes good care for months afterwards until the parts are thoroughly\\r\\nhealed. The operation simply closes a too large opening. The testicles\\r\\ndescending through the groin canal from the abdominal cavity before birth\\r\\nand in congenital rupture, left too big an opening. In acquired rupture,\\r\\nthese natural openings were enlarged by lifting, falls, etc. The round\\r\\nligament of the womb goes down through this canal and sometimes there is\\r\\ntoo large an opening left or acquired by accident.\\r\\n\\r\\nIrreducible Rupture.--This is when the rupture cannot be returned into\\r\\nthe abdominal cavity, and it is without any symptoms of strangulation.\\r\\nThey are of long standing and of a large size. This condition is often due\\r\\nto carelessness of a patient in not keeping in a reducible rupture with a\\r\\nproper support. Adhesions form, holding the rupture. Even if it is small,\\r\\nit gives rise to much discomfort and the patient is always in danger of\\r\\nstrangulation of the rupture.\\r\\n\\r\\nOperation for radical cure is generally a success.\\r\\n\\r\\n[124 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nStrangulation Hernia or Rupture.--This means the rupture is so tightly\\r\\nconstricted that it cannot be returned into the abdominal cavity, and its\\r\\ncirculation is interfered with; then there is not only obstruction to the\\r\\npassage of the feces, but also an arrest of circulation in the protruded\\r\\nportion of bowel which, if not relieved, results in gangrene and death.\\r\\nThis occurs more often in old than in recent ruptures and more often in\\r\\ncongenital than in acquired rupture.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--Sudden and complete constipation with persistent vomiting. The\\r\\nlump may be tense, hard and irreducible. Then there is faintness,\\r\\ncollapse; severe abdominal pain, complete constipation, with no gas\\r\\npassing, then vomiting, at first of food, then of the bile-stained fluid\\r\\nand finally of fluid with a bowel odor. All these symptoms increase and\\r\\nthe patient gradually sinks from exhaustion in eight or nine days, though\\r\\nin very acute cases the patient may die within forty-eight hours.\\r\\n\\r\\nMOTHERS\\' REMEDIES.--Strangulated Hernia, Hop Poultice for.--\"A large warm\\r\\npoultice of hops over the abdomen will be found one of the best known\\r\\nmeans of relieving strangulated hernia.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPHYSICIANS\\' TREATMENT.--It must be reduced or an operation must be\\r\\nperformed and soon.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo reduce.--The patient is put under an anesthetic and placed on his back\\r\\nwith the hips (pelvis) raised and the thigh of the affected side flexed,\\r\\nbent up and rotated inward if the rupture be inguinal or femoral. This\\r\\nmotion relaxes the parts. The neck of the sac is then seized with the\\r\\nthumb and fingers of one hand, and thus fixed, while with the other hand,\\r\\nthe operator endeavors to return the strangulated gut by gentle pressure\\r\\nin the proper direction. In femoral rupture, this is at first downward, to\\r\\nbring the gut opposite the opening then backward and then upward. In groin\\r\\n(inguinal) rupture it is usually slightly upward and outward. It must be\\r\\ncoaxed, kneaded and squeezed carefully. Care must be taken. If it cannot\\r\\nbe returned in from five to ten minutes no further time should be wasted,\\r\\nbut an operation should be performed immediately. This consists in cutting\\r\\ndown to the constriction and through it, thus allowing the rupture to be\\r\\nreduced.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe patient should be kept in bed and treated the same way as for other\\r\\nabdominal operations.\\r\\n\\r\\nCaution.--Persons with rupture must be very careful not to lift or fall.\\r\\nIf a support is worn it must fit perfectly and be worn with comfort.\\r\\n\\r\\n[DIGESTIVE ORGANS 125]\\r\\n\\r\\nINTESTINAL COLIC. (Enteralgia).--Causes.--Predisposing; poor general\\r\\ncondition, worry, over-work, nervous disposition. Exciting causes;\\r\\nexposure, gas in the bowels, mass of feces, undigested or irritating food,\\r\\ncold drinks, green fruit, ice cream when a person is very warm.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--Intermittent pain usually in the umbilical (navel) region,\\r\\nmoving from place to place, dull or sharp pain, relieved by pressure or\\r\\nbending forward. Abdomen is distended or drawn back. It lasts a few\\r\\nminutes or many hours, ending gradually or suddenly, after a passage of\\r\\ngas or movement of the bowels.\\r\\n\\r\\nPHYSICIANS\\' TREATMENT.--1. Remove cause first if possible. Mild cases; put\\r\\nheat to the abdomen by hot water bag, wring cloths out of hot water and\\r\\nput in them ten drops of turpentine and place over the bowels hot. Give\\r\\ndose of peppermint water or ginger tea.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Severe case.--Morphine hypodermically, if necessary, in a severe case;\\r\\nmustard poultice is good, also a spice poultice.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Tincture of Colocynth (bitter cucumber) is an excellent remedy for this\\r\\ntrouble. I have often used it with great success. Put five drops of it in\\r\\na glass half full of water and give two teaspoonfuls every fifteen minutes\\r\\nuntil relieved. A few doses generally relieve the patient.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE LIVER.--The liver is the largest gland in the body, and is situated in\\r\\nthe upper and right part of the abdominal cavity. The lower border of the\\r\\nliver corresponds to the lower border of the ribs in front and to the\\r\\nright side. It weighs fifty to sixty ounces in the male; in the female,\\r\\nforty to fifty ounces. It is about eight to nine inches in its transverse\\r\\nmeasurement; vertically near its right surface it is six to seven inches,\\r\\nwhile it is four to five inches thick at its thickest part. Opposite the\\r\\nbackbone from behind forward it measures about three inches. The left\\r\\nlobe, the smallest and thinnest, extends to the left, over what is called\\r\\nthe pit of the stomach.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBILIOUSNESS.--This condition presents different symptoms in different\\r\\ncases, but it always includes languor, headache or dizziness, perhaps some\\r\\nyellow color of the skin and conjunctiva, and a general sense of want of\\r\\ntone, depression of spirits and discomfort.\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses.--The liver does not perform its function well, or there is a\\r\\nretention of bile in the bile ducts. Most of the symptoms do not depend\\r\\ndirectly upon the changes in the bile, but upon failure of proper\\r\\ndigestion in the stomach and intestines. Certain poorly prepared foods or\\r\\nimproper food for stomach digestion, quickly cause the development of\\r\\nactive fermentation and its results irritate the stomach mucous membrane\\r\\nbringing about a faulty stomach secretion of mucus, which causes further\\r\\ntrouble. It may end in a sick headache.\\r\\n\\r\\nTREATMENT. Prevention.--Normal, easily digested food, open bowels. Active\\r\\nexercise, horseback riding, massage of the liver region. Stooping over and\\r\\nbending from side to side and bending back with feet close together are\\r\\ngood aids.\\r\\n\\r\\n[126 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nDiet.--Do not over-eat. Avoid alcohol in any form. Stimulating foods such\\r\\nas spices, mustard salads, concentrated meat extracts and meat broths,\\r\\npepper, horseradish are not to be used. Do not use too much salt; strong\\r\\ncoffee and tea are harmful. In severe cases milk either diluted with water\\r\\nor lime water or peptonized should alone be used.\\r\\n\\r\\nGruels, albumen water, kumiss, buttermilk and oyster broth may be allowed.\\r\\nOrange juice as well as lemonade may generally be given. Fasting is good\\r\\nin biliousness. No one will starve in a few days of fasting.\\r\\n\\r\\nMOTHERS\\' REMEDIES.--1. Biliousness, Lemons for.--\"One lemon squeezed in a\\r\\nglass of water with a very little sugar, repeat for several days.\" Lemon\\r\\nis a very good medicine, and it is surprising to know how few people\\r\\nrealize what medical properties the lemon contains. This is a good,\\r\\nsimple, but very effective remedy.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Biliousness, Salt and Water for.--\"Take a teaspoonful of salt to a cup\\r\\nof water and drink before breakfast for a few mornings.\" It is a\\r\\nwell-known fact that a little salt in warm water before breakfast is\\r\\nlaxative and also cleanses the system and bowels on account of its\\r\\npurifying action.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Biliousness, (chronic) Dandelion Tea for.--\"Dandelion root is highly\\r\\nrecommended for this.\" The root should be collected in July, August or\\r\\nSeptember. Dose:--A strong tea may be taken freely two or three times a\\r\\nday, or the fluid extract may be purchased at any drug store.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Biliousness, a cheap and very safe plan.--\"Drink plenty of cold water\\r\\nand exercise freely in the open air.\" Following the above advice is often\\r\\nbetter than medicines and spring tonics, also unless doing hard physical\\r\\nlabor, cut down on the meat eating. In fact, eat less generally for a\\r\\ntime.\\r\\n\\r\\n5. Biliousness, Salt Lemonade for.--\"Hot salt lemonade night and morning.\\r\\nJuice of one lemon and teaspoonful salt to as much hot water as you can\\r\\ndrink.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n6. Biliousness, Boneset Tea for.--\"Pour hot water on boneset and let stand\\r\\nuntil it is cold. Take a swallow occasionally.\" This is very good.\\r\\n\\r\\nPHYSICIANS\\' TREATMENT. Medicines.--1. Nitro-hydrochloric acid three drops\\r\\nthree times a day in half a tumblerful of water is valuable.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Twenty drops of fluid extract of Queen\\'s root three times a day.\\r\\n\\r\\n[DIGESTIVE ORGANS 127]\\r\\n\\r\\n3. The following combination forms a good pill to be taken every night:\\r\\n\\r\\n    Extract of Chirata    40 grains\\r\\n    Podophyllin            4 grains\\r\\n    Wahoo                  8 grains\\r\\n    Culver\\'s root          8 grains\\r\\n    Creosote              10 grains\\r\\n\\r\\nMix and make into twenty pills. Take one every night.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. For the Attack.--Take calomel one-sixth grain tablets; one every\\r\\nfifteen minutes until six are taken, and then follow with two to four\\r\\nteaspoonfuls of epsom salts.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nJAUNDICE (Icterus).--A symptom consisting in discoloration by bile pigment\\r\\nof the skin, whites of the eyes, other mucous membranes and secretions.\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses.--Obstruction of the gall ducts, from gall stones, inflammation,\\r\\ntumor, strictures, from pressure by tumors, and other enlarged abdominal\\r\\norgans.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--The skin and the conjunctiva (red membrane of the eyes) are\\r\\ncolored from a pale lemon yellow to a dark olive or greenish black. The\\r\\nitching may be intense, especially in a chronic case. The sweat may be\\r\\nyellow. The stools are a pale slate color, from the lack of bile, and are\\r\\noften pasty and offensive. The pulse is slow. Recovery depends upon the\\r\\ncause. Plain, simple jaundice cases recover in a few days or weeks.\\r\\n\\r\\nMOTHERS\\' REMEDIES.--1. Jaundice, Sweet Cider Sure Cure for.--\"New cider\\r\\nbefore it ferments at all. Drink all you can.\" This is a very simple\\r\\nremedy, but a sure one if taken in the early stages of jaundice. It causes\\r\\nthe bowels to move freely and carries off any impurities in the system.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Jaundice, Lemon Juice for.--\"Take a tablespoonful of lemon juice\\r\\nseveral times a day.\" This disease is produced by congestion of the liver,\\r\\nand as lemon is excellent as a liver tonic it is known to be an excellent\\r\\nremedy for jaundice.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Jaundice, Peach Tree Bark for.--\"Take the inner bark of a peach tree,\\r\\nand make a strong tea, and give a teaspoonful before each meal for five\\r\\ndays, then stop five days, and if the patient\\'s indications do not warrant\\r\\na reasonable expectation that a cure is effected repeat the medicine as\\r\\nabove. I never knew of a case in which the above medicine failed to cure.\\r\\nKeep the bowels open with sweet oil.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMOTHERS\\' REMEDIES for Liver Complaint. Mandrake Root for.--1. \"Dry and\\r\\npowder the mandrake root (often called may-apple) and take about one\\r\\nteaspoonful.\" This dose may be repeated two or three times a day,\\r\\naccording to the requirements of the case. This is a stimulant, a tonic\\r\\nand a laxative, and is especially good when the liver is in a torpid and\\r\\ninactive condition.\\r\\n\\r\\n[128 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Liver Trouble, Dandelion Root Tea for.--\"Steep dandelion root, make a\\r\\ngood strong tea of it; take a half glass three times a day.\" This is a\\r\\nvery good remedy as it not only acts on the liver, but the bowels as well.\\r\\nThis will always cure slight attacks of liver trouble.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Torpid Liver, Boneset Tea for.--\"Drink boneset tea at any time during\\r\\nthe day and at night. It is also good for cleansing the blood.\" This is a\\r\\nvery good remedy, especially for people who live in a low damp region.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Liver Trouble, Mandrake Leaves for.--\"A very good remedy to use\\r\\nregularly, for several weeks, is to use from one to three grains of\\r\\nmay-apple (mandrake) seed, night and morning, followed occasionally by a\\r\\nlight purgative, as seidlitz powder or rochelle salts.\" This is sure to\\r\\ngive relief if kept up thoroughly.\\r\\n\\r\\n5. Liver Trouble, Mullein Leaf Tea for.--\"Mullein leaves steeped, and\\r\\nsweetened. Drink freely.\" This acts very nicely upon the liver.\\r\\n\\r\\nPHYSICIANS\\' TREATMENT for Liver Trouble.--1. For the itching, hot alkaline\\r\\nbaths with baking soda in water, or dust on the following:--\\r\\n\\r\\n    Starch                  1 ounce\\r\\n    Camphor, powdered   l-1/2 drams\\r\\n    Oxide of Zinc         1/2 ounce\\r\\n\\r\\nMix and use as a powder, or use carbolic vaselin locally. Move the bowels\\r\\nwith salts and do not give much food for a few days. Use nothing but milk.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. The following is good to move the bowels when the stool is yellow and\\r\\ncostive in a child one year old:\\r\\n\\r\\n    Sulphate of Magnesia    2 ounces\\r\\n    Cream of tartar         2 ounces\\r\\n\\r\\nMix and give one-half teaspoonful in water every three hours until the\\r\\nbowels move freely. Phosphate of soda in one dram doses every three hours\\r\\nis good.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Severe Type and Epidemic Form.--Give one to two drops of tincture\\r\\nmyrica cerifera (barberry) every two hours for an adult. This I know to be\\r\\nvery good.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. The common simple kind of jaundice will get well readily by moving the\\r\\nbowels freely and keeping the patient on light food.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCATARRHAL JAUNDICE. (Acute catarrhal angiocholitis).--Jaundice caused by\\r\\nobstruction of the terminal portion of the common duct, by swelling of the\\r\\nmucous membrane.\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses.--This occurs mostly in young people. It follows inflammation of\\r\\nthe stomach or bowels, also from emotion, exposure, chronic heart disease.\\r\\nIt may be epidemic.\\r\\n\\r\\n[DIGESTIVE ORGANS 129]\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--Slight jaundice preceded by stomach and bowel trouble. Epidemic\\r\\ncases may begin with chill, headache and vomiting. There may be slight\\r\\npain in the abdomen, the skin is light or bright yellow, whites of the\\r\\neyes are yellowish, pain in the back and legs, tired feeling, nausea, clay\\r\\ncolored stools. Pulse is rather slow, liver may be a little enlarged. It\\r\\nmay last from one week to one to three months.\\r\\n\\r\\nPHYSICIANS\\' TREATMENT for Catarrhal Jaundice.--1. Restrict the diet if the\\r\\nstomach and bowels are diseased. Sodium phosphate may be given one\\r\\nteaspoonful every three hours to keep the bowels open. Drink large\\r\\nquantities of water and with it some baking soda one-half to one\\r\\nteaspoonful in the water.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. If you have calomel you may take one-tenth of a grain every hour for\\r\\nfour hours, and then follow with the sodium phosphate in one-half\\r\\nteaspoonful doses every two to three hours, until the bowels have fully\\r\\nmoved, or epsom salts, two to four teaspoonfuls. Keep in bed if there is a\\r\\nfever or a very slow pulse say of forty to fifty.\\r\\n\\r\\nGALL STONES. (Biliary Calculi, Cholelithiasis).--Cases of gall stones are\\r\\nrare under the age of twenty-five years. They are very common after\\r\\nforty-five, and three-fourths of the cases occur in women. Many people\\r\\nnever know they have them. Sedentary habits of life, excessive eating and\\r\\nconstipation tend to cause them. They may number a few, several, or a\\r\\nthousand, or only one.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--There are usually none while the stones are in the gall\\r\\nbladder, but when they pass from the gall bladder down through the\\r\\n(channel) duct into the bowel they often cause terrific pain, especially\\r\\nwhen the stone is large. Chill, fever, profuse sweating and vomiting,\\r\\nwhich comes in paroxysms or is continuous. The pain may be constant or\\r\\nonly come on at intervals. The region of the liver may be tender, the gall\\r\\nbladder may be enlarged, especially in chronic cases and very tender. In\\r\\nsome cases the pain comes every few weeks and then may be scattered,\\r\\nsometimes seeming to be in the stomach, and then in the bowels, or in the\\r\\nregion of the liver. When a person has such pains and locates them in the\\r\\nstomach or bowels, and they come periodically, every week or two or more,\\r\\nhe ought to be suspicious about it being gall stones, especially if the\\r\\nsymptoms do not show any stomach trouble. If the stone is large and closes\\r\\nthe common duct, jaundice occurs; the stools are light colored; the urine\\r\\ncontains bile. The attacks of pain may cease suddenly after a few hours,\\r\\nor they may last several days or recur at intervals until the stone is\\r\\npassed. The stones may be found in the bowel discharges after an attack.\\r\\nDeath may occur from collapse during an attack.\\r\\n\\r\\nMOTHERS\\' REMEDIES.--1. Gall Stones, Sweet Oil for.--\"Massaging the part\\r\\nover the region of the liver lightly night and morning is very good,\\r\\nfollowing by drinking a wineglassful of sweet oil at bedtime.\" The patient\\r\\nshould take some good cathartic the next morning, such as a seidlitz\\r\\npowder or cream of tartar. Teaspoonful in glass of water each morning.\\r\\nThis treatment should be continued for several weeks and is very\\r\\neffective.\\r\\n\\r\\n[130 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Gall Stones, Tried and Approved Remedy for.--\"Drink about a wineglass\\r\\nof olive oil at bedtime followed in the morning by a cathartic, as\\r\\nseidlitz powder, or cream of tartar and phosphate of soda; teaspoonful\\r\\neach morning in wineglass of water. This treatment to be pursued several\\r\\nweeks. Massage the part over the liver lightly night and morning. If the\\r\\nsuffering is intense use an injection of thirty drops of laudanum to two\\r\\nquarts of water.\" In many cases the cathartic may not be needed as the\\r\\nolive oil will move the bowels freely. Massaging the parts over the liver\\r\\nwill cause it to work better and has proven successful in many cases.\\r\\n\\r\\nPHYSICIANS\\' TREATMENT for Gall Stones.--1. For the pain. Morphine must be\\r\\nused and by the hypodermic method; one-fourth grain dose and repeated, if\\r\\nnecessary, and chloroform given before if the pain is intense, until the\\r\\nmorphine can act. Fomentations can be used over the liver.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Soda.--The bowels must be kept open by laxatives, Sodium Phosphate or\\r\\nSodium Sulphate, (Glauber\\'s) salt.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Olive Oil.--Olive oil is used very extensively. I do not know whether\\r\\nit does any good; some people think it does. From two to ten ounces daily,\\r\\nif possible. The phosphate or sulphate of sodium should be taken daily in\\r\\none to two teaspoonfuls doses each day. Some claim these salts prevent\\r\\nformation of gall stones.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Powder for the Itching.--For the intolerable itching you may use the\\r\\nfollowing powder, dust some of it over the skin:\\r\\n\\r\\n    Starch            1 ounce\\r\\n    Zinc Oxide      1/2 ounce\\r\\n    Camphor       1-1/2 drams\\r\\n\\r\\nMix into a powder.\\r\\n\\r\\nDiet.--This must be thoroughly regulated. The patient should avoid the\\r\\nstarchy and sugar foods as much as possible. He or she should also take\\r\\nregular exercise. If a person afflicted with gall stones keeps the stomach\\r\\nand bowels in good condition, they will be better. Pure air, sunshine,\\r\\nexercise, and diet are big factors in the treatment of chronic diseases. A\\r\\nwoman so afflicted should not wear anything tight around the stomach and\\r\\nliver, corsets are an abomination in this disease; olive oil if taken must\\r\\nbe continued for months.\\r\\n\\r\\nSurgery.--The operation is indicated when the patient is suffering most of\\r\\nthe time from pain in the liver region or when the person is failing in\\r\\nhealth, or during an acute attack. When there are symptoms of obstruction\\r\\nor when there is fever, sweating shows that there is pus in the gall\\r\\nbladder. Also an operation is then necessary, and in most cases it results\\r\\nsatisfactorily.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[DIGESTIVE ORGANS 131]\\r\\n\\r\\nCANCER OF THE GALL BLADDER, AND BILE DUCTS. Causes.--It usually occurs\\r\\nbetween forty and seventy years of age. The cases that originate here show\\r\\nno percentage in either sex; but those that appear here as secondary\\r\\ncancers are three times as frequent in women as in men. Chronic irritation\\r\\nby gall stones is an important cause. They are hard to diagnose and, of\\r\\ncourse, fatal in the secondary kind. For the primary kind early complete\\r\\nremoval may cure if you can get at them.\\r\\n\\r\\nCIRCULATORY DISTURBANCES OF THE LIVER. (Acute Hyperemia or\\r\\nCongestion).--This occurs normally after meals, and in acute infections,\\r\\ndiseases, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nCHRONIC CONGESTION OR NUTMEG LIVER.--This is due to an obstruction of the\\r\\nblood circulation in the liver by chronic valvular heart disease with\\r\\nfailure of heart action. Lung obstruction in the trouble called Emphysema,\\r\\nChronic Pneumonia, etc., may cause it. The cut section of a liver shows an\\r\\nappearance like a nutmeg, due to a deeply congested central vein and\\r\\ncapillaries. In a later stage the liver is contracted, central liver cells\\r\\nare shrunk and the connective tissue is increased.\\r\\n\\r\\nACUTE YELLOW ATROPHY. (Malignant Jaundice).--This is fortunately a rare\\r\\ndisease. There is rapid progress, and it is fatal in nearly all cases. The\\r\\nliver is very small and flabby. The symptoms are many and are hard to\\r\\ndifferentiate. You must depend upon your physician. The only thing for him\\r\\nto do is to meet the symptoms and relieve them if possible.\\r\\n\\r\\nCIRRHOSIS OF THE LIVER. (Sclerosis of the Liver, Hobnail Liver, Gin\\r\\nDrinkers Liver, Hard Liver).--This occurs most often in men from forty to\\r\\nsixty years old. It is not uncommon in children.\\r\\n\\r\\nCause.--It is usually due to drinking of alcohol to excess, especially\\r\\nwhisky, brandy, rum or gin. The liver is small and thin; hard, granular,\\r\\nwhite bands run through it and press on the liver cells and destroy them.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--These are few as long as proper circulation in the heart is\\r\\nmaintained. Fatty cirrhosis is often found in post-mortems. The first\\r\\nsymptoms are the same as those accompanying chronic gastritis, dyspepsia,\\r\\nThey are:--Appetite is poor, nausea, retching and vomiting, especially in\\r\\nthe morning; distress in the region of the stomach, constipation or\\r\\ndiarrhea. These increase and vomiting of blood from the stomach may occur\\r\\nearly and late. Bleeding from the stomach and bowels, etc., cause the\\r\\nstools to look like tar. Nosebleed and piles are common and profuse;\\r\\nbleeding may cause severe lack of blood. The epigastric and mammary veins\\r\\nare enlarged. Ascites (dropsy in the abdomen) usually occurs sooner or\\r\\nlater and may be very marked, and it recurs soon after each tapping. The\\r\\nfeet and genital organs may be oedematous (watery swelling), jaundice is\\r\\nslight and does not occur until late. During the late stage the patient is\\r\\nmuch shrunken, face is hollow, the blood vessels of the nose and cheeks\\r\\nare dilated, abdomen is greatly distended. Delirium, stupor, coma or\\r\\nconvulsions may occur at any time.\\r\\n\\r\\n[132 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nPHYSICIANS\\' TREATMENT for Cirrhosis of the Liver.--It is usually fatal;\\r\\nsometimes even after temporary improvements. No coffee or alcohol; simple\\r\\ndiet, bitter tonics, keep bowels open, A physician must handle such a\\r\\ncase.\\r\\n\\r\\nABSCESS OF THE LIVER. Hepatic Abscess: Suppurative Hepatitis.--This is a\\r\\ncircumscribed collection of pus in the liver tissue. If there is only one\\r\\nabscess it is in the larger lobe in seventy per cent of the cases. The\\r\\namount of fluid contained in such an abscess may be two or three quarts\\r\\nand its color varies from a grayish white to a creamy reddish-brown; when\\r\\nthe abscess is caused by a type (amebic) of dysentery, there is generally\\r\\nonly one abscess, occurring more often in the right lobe, whereas other\\r\\nforms due to septic infection give rise to many abscesses.\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses.--This disease is rare even in tropical climates. When it is\\r\\nexcited by gall stones, it is invariably septic in character and the\\r\\ninfecting material reaches the interior through the liver vessels or bile\\r\\npassages. Stomach ulcers, typhoid fever, appendicitis, may bring on such\\r\\nan abscess. Pus wounds of the head are sometimes followed by a liver\\r\\nabscess. The most common method of infection is through the portal vein.\\r\\nOther causes that may be mentioned are foreign bodies traveling up the\\r\\nducts, as round-worms and parasites.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--Hectic temperature, pain, tenderness, and an enlarged liver,\\r\\nand often slight jaundice. In acute cases the fever rises rapidly,\\r\\nreaching 103 or 104 in twenty-four hours. It is irregular and\\r\\nintermittent, and it may be hectic, that is, like the fever of\\r\\nconsumption. Shakings or decided chills frequently are present with the\\r\\nrise of fever and when the fever declines there may be profuse sweating.\\r\\nThe skin is pale and shows a slight jaundice, the conjunctiva being\\r\\nyellowish. Progressive loss of strength with disturbance of the stomach\\r\\nand bowels is present. The bowels are variable and constipated and loose.\\r\\nDropsy of the abdomen (Ascites) may develop, on account of pressure on the\\r\\nbig vein, inferior vena-cava. Lung symptoms, severe cough, reddish-brown\\r\\nexpectoration are often present.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE ABSCESS.--May break into the pleural cavity, bronchial tubes, lungs\\r\\nand stomach, bowels, peritoneum or through the abdominal wall.\\r\\n\\r\\nRecovery.--The result is unfavorable as it generally goes on to a rapid\\r\\ntermination. The abscess should be opened and evacuated when its location\\r\\ncan be detected. The death rates ranges from fifty to sixty per cent.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--Open it if you can, Sponge liver region with cool water. For\\r\\nthe pain, mustard poultices, turpentine stupe or hot fomentations prove\\r\\nbeneficial. Keep up strength by stimulation and quinine.\\r\\n\\r\\n[DIGESTIVE ORGANS 133]\\r\\n\\r\\nDiet in Liver Troubles sent us from Providence Hospital (Catholic),\\r\\nSandusky, Ohio:\\r\\n\\r\\nMay Take--\\r\\n\\r\\nSoups--Vegetable soups with a little bread or cracker, light broths.\\r\\n\\r\\nFish--Boiled fresh cod, bass, sole or whiting, raw oysters.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeats--Tender lean mutton, lamb, chicken, game, (all sparingly).\\r\\n\\r\\nFarinaceous--Oatmeal, hominy, tapioca, sago, arrowroot (well cooked),\\r\\nwhole wheat bread, graham bread, dry toast, crackers.\\r\\n\\r\\nVegetables--Mashed potato, almost all fresh vegetables (well boiled),\\r\\nplain salad of lettuce, water-cress, dandelions.\\r\\n\\r\\nDesserts--Plain milk pudding of tapioca, sago, arrowroot or stewed fresh\\r\\nfruit (all without sugar or cream), raw ripe fruits.\\r\\n\\r\\nDrinks--Weak tea or coffee (without sugar or cream), hot water, pure,\\r\\nplain or aerated water.\\r\\n\\r\\nMust Not Take--\\r\\n\\r\\nStrong soups, rich made dishes of any kind, hot bread or biscuits,\\r\\npreserved fish or meats, curries, red meats, eggs, fats, butter, sugar,\\r\\nherrings, eels, salmon, mackerel, sweets, creams, cheese, dried fruits,\\r\\nnuts, pies, pastry, cakes, malt liquors, sweet wines, champagne.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nACUTE GENERAL PERITONITIS. (Inflammation of the Peritoneum, Lining of the\\r\\nAbdominal Cavity).--Causes. Primary; Occurs without any known preceding\\r\\ndisease, and is rare. Secondary; Occurs from injuries, extension from\\r\\ninflamed nearby organs, such as appendicitis or infection from bacteria,\\r\\nwithout any apparent lesion (disease of the bowel). Perforation causes\\r\\nmost of the attacks of peritonitis. Peritonitis may accompany acute\\r\\ninfections or accompany chronic nephritis, rheumatism, pleurisy,\\r\\ntuberculosis and septicemia. Peritonitis occurs from perforation of the\\r\\nbowel in typhoid fever also, and it frequently occurs after appendicitis\\r\\nand sometimes after confinement.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--This is often the history of one of the causes mentioned above,\\r\\nfollowed in cases with perforation or septic disease by a chill or chilly\\r\\nfeeling and pain, varying at first, with the place where the inflammation\\r\\nbegins. The patient lies on his back, with the knees drawn up, and the\\r\\nbody bent so as to relax the muscles of the abdomen, which are often\\r\\nrigidly contracted,--stiff at first on the side where the pain starts. The\\r\\npain may be absent. The abdomen becomes distended, tympanitic (caused by\\r\\ngas). An early symptom is vomiting and it is often repeated. There is\\r\\nconstipation; occasionally diarrhea occurs. The temperature may rise\\r\\nrapidly to 104 or 105 and then become lower; it is sometimes normal. The\\r\\npulse is frequent, small, wiry and beats 100 to 150 per minute; the\\r\\nbreathing is frequent and shallow. The tongue becomes red and dry and\\r\\ncracked. Passing the urine frequently causes pain; sometimes there is\\r\\nretention of urine. The face looks pinched, the eyes are sunken, the\\r\\nexpression is anxious, and the skin of the face is lead colored or livid.\\r\\nHiccoughs, muttering, delirium or stupor may be present.\\r\\n\\r\\n[134 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nRecovery, Prognosis, etc.--The action of the heart becomes weak and\\r\\nirregular, respiration is shallow, the temperature taken in the rectum is\\r\\nhigh, the skin is cold, pale and livid, death occurs sometimes suddenly,\\r\\nusually in three to five days; less often thirty-six to forty-eight hours;\\r\\nor even after ten days. The results depend mainly upon the cause of the\\r\\ninflammation, and the nature of the infection, infectious disease that\\r\\nproduces it, being usually very bad after puerperal sepsis (after\\r\\nconfinement), induced abortion, perforation of the bowel or stomach, or\\r\\nrupture of an abscess.\\r\\n\\r\\nLOCAL PERITONITIS.--This may come from local injury, but it is usually\\r\\nsecondary to empyema, tuberculosis, or cancer, abscess, perforation of the\\r\\nstomach or bowel, ulcer, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--Onset is usually sudden. There is sudden local pain, increased\\r\\nby any movements; tenderness, and vomiting; then chills, irregular fever,\\r\\nsweating, difficult breathing, emaciation.\\r\\n\\r\\nTREATMENT OF THE ACUTE PERITONITIS.--There must be absolute rest, morphine\\r\\nby hypodermic method, one-fourth to one-half grain to relieve the pain.\\r\\nIce cold and hot fomentations with some herb remedy like hops, smartweed,\\r\\netc.; or cloths wrung out of hot water with five to ten drops of\\r\\nturpentine sprinkled on them. This is very good when there is much\\r\\nbloating from gas.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe turpentine should be stopped when the skin shows red from it. The\\r\\ncloths should not be heavy or they will cause pain by their weight. Ice\\r\\nwater can be used when cold cloths are needed.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor vomiting.--Stop all food and drink for the time and give cracked ice.\\r\\n\\r\\nDiet.--Should be hot or cold milk with lime water or peptonized milk if\\r\\nnecessary. If the feeding causes vomiting, you must give food by the\\r\\nrectum. For the severe bloating enemas containing turpentine should be\\r\\ngiven, one to two to six ounces of water used with ten to thirty drops of\\r\\nturpentine in it; sometimes it is necessary to resort to surgery.\\r\\n\\r\\nTUBERCULAR PERITONITIS.--This may occur as a primary trouble or secondary\\r\\nto tuberculosis of the bowels, lungs, and Fallopian tube. It is most\\r\\nfrequent in males between twenty and forty.\\r\\n\\r\\n[ DIGESTIVE ORGANS 135]\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--These are variable. It may occur like acute peritonitis with\\r\\nsudden onset of high fever, pain, tenderness, bloating, vomiting and\\r\\nconstipation; these symptoms passing into those of chronic peritonitis.\\r\\nOften there are gradual loss of strength and flesh, low and irregular\\r\\nfever; frequently the temperature goes below normal with a little ascites\\r\\ntympanites, constipation, diarrhea and masses in the abdomen which consist\\r\\nof the omentum (apron covering the bowels) rolled up and matted into a\\r\\nsausage-shaped tumor in  the upper part of the abdomen, or of thickened or\\r\\nadherent coils of the bowel, enlarged mesentric lymph nodes, etc.\\r\\nSpontaneous recovery may occur, or the course of the disease may resemble\\r\\nthat of a malignant tumor.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--If there is effusion and few adhesions, cutting in and\\r\\nremoving the fluid may help. In other cases good nourishing diet with cod\\r\\nliver oil is best.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nASCITES. (Hydroperitoneum. Abdominal Dropsy).--This is an accumulation of\\r\\nserous fluid in the peritoneal cavity. It is but a symptom of disease.\\r\\n\\r\\nLocal Causes.--Chronic peritonitis, obstruction of the portal (vein)\\r\\ncirculation as in cirrhosis of the liver, cancer or other liver disease,\\r\\nfrom heart disease, tumors, as of the ovaries or enlarged spleen. All\\r\\nthese mentioned may produce this dropsy.\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral Cause.--Heart disease, chronic nephritis, chronic malaria, cancer,\\r\\nsyphilis, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--Gradual increasing distention of the abdomen, causing sometimes\\r\\na sense of weight, then difficulty of breathing from pressure. The abdomen\\r\\nis distended, flattened at the sides unless it is very full. The skin may\\r\\nbe stretched tense, superficial veins are distended. The navel may be flat\\r\\nor even protrude and around it the vessels may be greatly enlarged. There\\r\\nis fluctuation when you tap sharply at one side, while holding your hand\\r\\non the other side you feel a wavy feeling.\\r\\n\\r\\nPHYSICIANS\\' TREATMENT for Ascites.--First treat the disease causing it.\\r\\nSometimes it is necessary in order to prolong life to repeatedly tap the\\r\\npatient as in cirrhosis of the liver. When it is caused by the heart or\\r\\nkidneys, give cathartics that carry away much liquid, hydragogue\\r\\ncathartics. One dram of jalap at night followed by a big dose of salts\\r\\nbefore breakfast. Cream of tartar and salts are good, equal parts. Or\\r\\ncream of tartar alone, one to two drams, with lemon juice in water in\\r\\nrepeated doses. Digitalis and squill, of each one grain to cause great\\r\\nflow of urine. Infusion of digitalis is also good to increase flow of\\r\\nurine, when the heart is the real cause of the ascites. These treatments\\r\\ntake the liquids away through the proper channels, the bowels and kidneys.\\r\\n\\r\\n[136 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nAscites caused by an Ovarian Tumor.--The tumor must be removed. I am not\\r\\nin favor of indiscriminate operating, but operations often save lives. I\\r\\nremember one case in which I very strongly urged the lady to have an\\r\\noperation performed. It was a case of ascites, caused, as I was sure, by a\\r\\ntumor of the ovary. The lady, as almost all people do,--and I do not blame\\r\\nthem for it,--dreaded even the thought of an operation, but she was\\r\\nfinally compelled to have an operation or die. She filled so full that it\\r\\nwas almost impossible for her to breathe. She went away from home in\\r\\nterrible shape, almost out of breath, and returned home a well woman and\\r\\nhas remained so. Such cases formerly died. But not all cases of ascites\\r\\ncan be cured by an operation, it depends upon the cause. In many cases all\\r\\none can do is to doctor the cause, if that cannot be removed, make the\\r\\npatient\\'s remaining days as comfortable as possible.\\r\\n\\r\\nDISEASES OF THE RECTUM AND ANUS.--The lower part of the alimentary canal\\r\\nis called the rectum, originally meaning straight. It is not straight in\\r\\nthe human animal. It is six to eight inches long. The anus is the lower\\r\\nopening of the rectum. In health it is closed by the external Sphincter\\r\\n(closing muscle). Disease may wear this muscle out and then the anus\\r\\nremains open, causing the contents of the bowel to move involuntary.\\r\\n\\r\\nCONSTIPATION. Causes.--1. Mechanical obstruction.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Defective motion of the bowels.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Deficient bowel secretions.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Other causes. Mechanical obstruction.--Anything that will hinder the\\r\\nfree and easy passage of the feces (bowel contents). Too tight external\\r\\nsphincter (rectum) muscle, stricture, tumors, etc. Bending of the womb on\\r\\nthe bowel.\\r\\n\\r\\nDefective Worm-like Bowel Movement.--Irregular habits of living head the\\r\\nlist causing this defective action. Everyone should promptly attend to\\r\\nNature\\'s call. Some people wait until the desire for stool has all gone,\\r\\nand in that way the \"habit\" of the bowels is gradually lost. Everyone\\r\\nshould go to stool at a certain regular time each day, and at any other\\r\\ntime when Nature calls. If a person heeds this call of Nature, the call\\r\\nwill come regularly at the proper time, say every morning after breakfast.\\r\\nIf these sensations (Nature\\'s calls) are ignored day after day, the mucous\\r\\nmembrane soon loses its sensitiveness and the muscular coat its tonicity,\\r\\nand as a result, large quantities of fecal matter may accumulate in the\\r\\nsigmoid (part of the bowel) or in the rectum without exciting the least\\r\\ndesire to empty the bowels. Again, irregular time for eating and improper\\r\\ndiet are liable to diminish this action also. Foods that contain very\\r\\nlittle liquid and those that do not leave much residue are liable to\\r\\naccumulate in the bowel and at the same time press upon the rectum hard\\r\\nenough to produce a partial paralysis.\\r\\n\\r\\nDeficiency of the Secretions.--Many of the causes that hinder worm-like\\r\\nmotion are also likely to lessen the normal secretions of the bowel. Some\\r\\nkinds of liver diseases tend to lessen the secretions of the bowel,\\r\\nbecause the amount of bile emptied into the bowel is lessened. Sometimes\\r\\nthe glands of the intestine are rendered less active by disease and other\\r\\ncauses.\\r\\n\\r\\nSundry Causes.--Diabetes, melancholy, insanity, old age, paralysis, lead\\r\\npoisoning and some troubles of local origin, like fissure of the rectum,\\r\\nulceration, stricture and polypus.\\r\\n\\r\\n[DIGESTIVE ORGANS 137]\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--Headache, inattention to business, loss of memory, melancholy,\\r\\nsallow complexion, indigestion, loss of appetite, nervous symptoms.\\r\\nSpasmodic muscular contraction of the external sphincter. The bowel\\r\\ncontents press upon it; spasm of this sphincter muscle is frequently\\r\\nbrought on by the presence of a crack in the mucous membrane, caused by\\r\\ninjury inflicted during expulsion of hardened feces. Instead of aiding a\\r\\nbowel movement, the muscles now present an obstruction beyond control of\\r\\nthe will and aggravate the condition. The most frequent cause of disease\\r\\nof the rectum is constipation and anyone of the following local diseases\\r\\nof the rectum and anus may be a symptom of constipation. (1) Fissure or\\r\\ncrack of the anus. (2) Ulceration. (3) Hemorrhoids (piles). (4) Prolapse\\r\\n(falling). (5) Neuralgia. (6) Proctitis and periproctitis.\\r\\n\\r\\nFissure of the anus is a common local symptom of constipation. The feces\\r\\naccumulate when the bowels do not move for a few days, the watery portion\\r\\nis absorbed; they become dry, hard, lumpy, and very difficult to expel,\\r\\nfrequently making a rent (tear) in the mucous membrane and resulting\\r\\neventually in an irritable fissure. Ulceration of the rectum and the\\r\\nsigmoid (part of the bowel) is a symptom of persistent constipation,\\r\\nbecause the pressure exerted upon the nourishing blood vessels by the\\r\\nfecal mass causes local death of the tissues.\\r\\n\\r\\nHemorrhoids (Piles) may be produced by constipation in several ways; first\\r\\nby obstruction to the return of the venous (dark) blood. Second, by venous\\r\\nengorgement (filling up) of the hemorrhoidal veins during violent and\\r\\nprolonged straining at stool. Third, as a result of the general looseness\\r\\nof the tissues in those suffering from constipation.\\r\\n\\r\\nProlapse (Falling of the Bowel).--This falling of the rectum may be\\r\\npartial or complete, and may be caused by straining or by the downward\\r\\npressure exerted by the fecal mass during the emptying movement of the\\r\\nbowel. It may also be the result of a partial paralysis of the bowel\\r\\ncaused by pressure of the feces upon the nerves.\\r\\n\\r\\nProctitis and Peri-Proctitis.--Inflammation of the rectum and surrounding\\r\\ntissue that may or may not terminate in an abscess and fistula, sometimes\\r\\nfollows injury to the very sensitive mucous membrane by the hardened\\r\\nfeces.\\r\\n\\r\\nNeuralgia of the Rectum.--This may sometimes result from the pressure of\\r\\nthe fecal mass upon the nearby nerves causing pain in the sacrum coccyx\\r\\n(bones).\\r\\n\\r\\nMOTHERS\\' REMEDIES.--1.

This will give relief when\\r\\nother remedies fail.\\r\\n\\r\\nPHYSICIANS\\' TREATMENT for Constipation.--Too much reliance has been placed\\r\\nupon medicine in the treatment of this disease and too little attention\\r\\ngiven to diet, and the establishment of regular habits in eating,\\r\\nexercising, sleeping and attending to the calls of Nature. Also, local\\r\\ndisease of the rectum has been overlooked until of late years. Remedies of\\r\\na laxative and cathartic nature soon lose their power and the dose must be\\r\\nrepeated or a new remedy must be given. This method of treatment is well\\r\\nrecommended and is very good.\\r\\n\\r\\n1--Stretching of the sphincter.\\r\\n\\r\\n2--Frequent rectal and abdominal massage.\\r\\n\\r\\n3--Copious injection of warm water (in the beginning only).\\r\\n\\r\\n4--Application of electricity over the abdomen and in the rectum.\\r\\n\\r\\n[140 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to this treatment which must be carried out by a physician the\\r\\npatient must observe the following rules: Go to stool daily, and as near\\r\\nthe same time as is convenient, correct errors of diet. Drink an abundance\\r\\nof water and eat sufficient fruit. Take plenty of outdoor exercise; take a\\r\\ncold bath every morning followed by a thorough rubbing. Dress warmly in\\r\\nwinter and cool in summer. Change of temperature or climate if the case\\r\\ndemands it. Be temperate in all things affecting the general health.\\r\\nStretching the sphincter must be done carefully, but in a thorough manner.\\r\\nIt can only be done properly by an experienced person. Stretching of the\\r\\nsphincter closes the opening so that the feces are not passed at all\\r\\ntimes. It is circular in shape. Sometimes this grows larger, stiffer, or\\r\\nit acts spasmodically. The opening is often so tight in some people that\\r\\nit is difficult to introduce even a finger, and it frequently produces a\\r\\nspasm of pain in the bowels, stomach and head to do so. This kind will\\r\\nproduce constipation or make it worse. In such cases it should be\\r\\nstretched thoroughly but carefully so that the muscle will be able to\\r\\nclose the opening and the bowel contents will not pass at any time\\r\\nunhindered. There are two methods of stretching the muscle--forcible or\\r\\ngradual. The forcible method is generally done by inserting the two thumbs\\r\\ninto the anus and stretching the muscle thoroughly in every direction\\r\\nuntil there is no resistance. (Dilators are made for this purpose, but\\r\\nunless they are very carefully used they will tear the muscle). The\\r\\nforcible method should be done under an anesthetic. Gradual stretching is\\r\\ndone when an anesthetic cannot be used. It is better to do too little than\\r\\nto do too much at the first sitting. The muscle is very stubborn\\r\\nsometimes, and it requires careful handling or the irritability will be\\r\\nincreased. An instrument in the hands of a careful man is all right. They\\r\\ncan be stretched by the fingers or the Wales\\' bougie, thus: Patients\\r\\nshould come to the office two or three times a week, the instrument\\r\\n(bougies) are introduced and allowed to remain within the bowel until the\\r\\nmuscle resistance is overcome, and many times their withdrawal will soon\\r\\nbe followed by a copious stool. Forcible stretching is seldom required\\r\\nmore than once, if a large sized instrument is used from time to time\\r\\nafterward, just as in gradual stretching; when thorough dilatation has\\r\\nbeen accomplished, the muscle instead of acting as an impassable barrier\\r\\nto the discharge of the feces, now offers only passive resistance, but\\r\\nsufficiently strong, however, to prevent any unpleasant accidents, yet not\\r\\nstrong enough to resist the power of the expulsory muscles when the latter\\r\\nare brought into full play during stool. Large quantities of feces do not\\r\\nnow accumulate; consequently the pressure upon the mucous membrane and\\r\\nneighboring nerves is eliminated, and the bowel regains its normal\\r\\nsensibility and strength. There are now sold dilators in sets for self use\\r\\nin almost every drug store. These when used continuously do good and\\r\\nsuccessful work.\\r\\n\\r\\n[DIGESTIVE ORGANS 141]\\r\\n\\r\\nAbdominal Massage. (Kneading, Rubbing, etc.).--This is an essential\\r\\nfeature in the treatment. It was practiced by Hippocrates hundreds of\\r\\nyears ago. Place the patient in the recumbent position upon a table which\\r\\ncan be so manipulated that the head may be raised or lowered, the body\\r\\nrolled from side to side. Gentle but firm pressure is then made with the\\r\\npalm of the hand and the ball of the thumb over the large intestine\\r\\nbeginning in the lower right groin region. Then go up to the ribs on the\\r\\nright side, then over the body to the same place on the left side and down\\r\\nto the left lower side and center, accompanying the pressure by kneading\\r\\nthe parts thoroughly with the fingers. Repeat this several times for about\\r\\nten to twelve minutes. At first this should be practised every day; later\\r\\ntwice a week. Special treatment should be given the small intestines and\\r\\nliver when the bile and intestinal secretion are lessened. In children\\r\\ngentle rubbing of the abdomen with circular movements from right to left\\r\\nwith a little oil for ten minutes daily will help to increase the action\\r\\nof the bowels and often bring on a normal movement.\\r\\n\\r\\nCopious Warm Water Injections.--This is good at the beginning of the\\r\\ntreatment when the feces become packed. They soften the mass and aid its\\r\\ndischarge. The water must go above the rectum into the colon. To do this a\\r\\ncolon tube from eighteen to twenty-four inches long, a good syringe (the\\r\\nDavidson bulb) hard rubber piston or a fountain syringe, the nozzle of\\r\\nwhich can be inserted into the tube, are required. The patient is placed\\r\\nin the lying down position on the left side with knees drawn up, with the\\r\\nhips elevated. Oil the tube and pass it gently and slowly up the bowel for\\r\\na few inches until it meets with a slight obstruction. A few ounces of\\r\\nwater are then forced through the tube and at the same time pressure is\\r\\nmade upward with the tube; by these means the obstruction will be lifted\\r\\nout of the way each time the tube meets with resistance; the procedure\\r\\nmust be repeated until the tube is well within the colon. Attach the\\r\\nsyringe to the tube and allow the water to run until the colon is\\r\\ndistended. A quart to a gallon of warm water can be used depending upon\\r\\nthe age and amount of feces present. The water should be retained as long\\r\\nas possible.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe injections should be continued daily until all the feces has been\\r\\nremoved. They should not be used for weeks as has been recommended. If\\r\\nsoap suds are used in the enema, green or soft soap should be used, not\\r\\nthe hard soap.\\r\\n\\r\\nElectricity.--One pole may be placed over the spinal column and the other\\r\\nmoved about over the course of the colon, or one over the spine and the\\r\\nother over the rectum.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain constipation is caused by the womb lying upon the rectum. Change\\r\\nthis condition. (See diseases of women).\\r\\n\\r\\n[142 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nRules.--Patients should go to stool daily at the same hour, usually after\\r\\nthe morning meal. You can educate the bowel to act daily at the same hour\\r\\nor after breakfast; or on the other hand not more than once in two or\\r\\nthree days in those who are careless in their habits. Some patients need\\r\\nto have two or three movements daily in order to feel well. It may take\\r\\ntime to educate the bowels to do this, but it can be done in many cases\\r\\nand many persons become constipated because they put off attending to the\\r\\neducated bowel\\'s call, and often produce constipation by carelessness. It\\r\\nis surprising how many educated people put off this duty; Nature\\r\\nneglected, soon ceases to call. If constipated persons will persevere in\\r\\ngoing to the closet at or near the same time every day and devote their\\r\\nentire time while there to the expulsion of the fecal contents, and not\\r\\nmake it a reading room, they will bring about the desired result. Patients\\r\\nare apt to become discouraged at first; they should be informed that the\\r\\nfinal result of the treatment is not influenced by the failure of the\\r\\nbowel to act regularly during the first few days. Do not strain to expel\\r\\nthe stool.\\r\\n\\r\\nCorrections of Errors in Diet.--This is one of the necessary features in\\r\\nthe treatment. All kinds of foods known to disagree should be discarded.\\r\\nThe foods should be easily digested. In children the diet should be rich\\r\\nin fats, albuminoids and sugar, but poor in starches. A reasonable amount\\r\\nof fruits such as apples, oranges, and figs should be allowed. Meals\\r\\nshould be at regular hours. Foods that can be used:\\r\\n\\r\\nMay Take--\\r\\n\\r\\nSoups.--Meat broths, oyster soup.\\r\\n\\r\\nFish.--Boiled fish of all kinds, raw oysters.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeats.--Almost any fresh tender meat, poultry, game, not fried.\\r\\n\\r\\nFarinaceous.--Oatmeal, wheaten grits, mush, hominy, whole wheat bread,\\r\\ncorn bread, graham bread, rye bread.\\r\\n\\r\\nVegetables.--Boiled onions, brussels sprouts, spinach, cauliflower,\\r\\npotatoes, asparagus, green corn, green peas, string beans, salads with\\r\\noil.\\r\\n\\r\\nDesserts.--Stewed prunes, figs, baked apples with cream, ripe peaches,\\r\\npears, oranges, apples, melons, grapes, cherries, raisins, honey, plain\\r\\npuddings, fig puddings, apple charlotte.\\r\\n\\r\\nDrinks.--Plenty of pure water, cold or hot, new cider, buttermilk, orange\\r\\njuice, unfermented grape juice.\\r\\n\\r\\nMust Not Take--\\r\\n\\r\\nSalt, smoked, potted or preserved fish or meats, pork, liver, eggs, new\\r\\nbread, puddings of rice or sago, pastry, milk, sweets, tea, nuts, cheese,\\r\\npineapple, spirituous liquors.\\r\\n\\r\\nFoods classed as laxatives are honey, cider, molasses, and acid fruits,\\r\\nsuch as apples, pears, peaches, cherries, and oranges. Berries are\\r\\neffective laxatives on account of the acids and seeds they contain.\\r\\n(Huckleberries are constipating). Prunes, dates and figs are good and\\r\\neffective, also fruit juices.\\r\\n\\r\\n[DIGESTIVE ORGANS 143]\\r\\n\\r\\nDrinks.--There are few laxatives better than a glass of cold water or\\r\\npreferably hot water, taken upon an empty stomach before breakfast; water\\r\\nprevents the feces from becoming dry and massed, and stimulates the\\r\\nintestinal movements. A pinch of salt added to the water increases its\\r\\neffectiveness.\\r\\n\\r\\nOut-door Exercise.--This should be taken regularly and freely.\\r\\n\\r\\nBathing.--The best time is before breakfast, and in as cold water as\\r\\npossible. The bath should be followed by a thorough rubbing of the skin\\r\\nwith a Turkish towel.\\r\\n\\r\\nClothing.--Warm clothing in winter; cool clothing in summer.  Cold weather\\r\\ninduces constipation, and warm weather diarrhea. Moderate manner of living\\r\\nis everything.\\r\\n\\r\\nPHYSICIANS\\' TREATMENT for Constipation. 1. One year to three years.--For\\r\\ninfants one teaspoonful or less of black molasses or store syrup, or of\\r\\nolive oil; and Mellin\\'s food eaten dry, is good for babies a year and\\r\\nolder.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Small Children.--Increase cream in the milk, give oatmeal or barley\\r\\nwater. Castile soap suppository, enema, massage, castor oil, or citrate of\\r\\nmagnesia if drugs are needed.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Older Children.--In older children, fruit, oatmeal, etc. Black molasses\\r\\nis good for children, one to two teaspoonfuls.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Fluid Extract of Cascara Sagrada.--Dose: ten to sixty drops at night.\\r\\nThis is good for a great many cases and sometimes it cures the trouble,\\r\\nbut on the other hand it seems to injure some people.\\r\\n\\r\\n5. The Aromatic Cascara is also good; doses are larger and pleasant to\\r\\ntake. This is more agreeable for children.\\r\\n\\r\\n6. The Compound Licorice Powder is a mild, simple laxative and effective.\\r\\nIt is composed of senna eighteen parts, licorice root powder sixteen\\r\\nparts, fennel eight parts, washed sulphur eight parts, sugar fifty parts.\\r\\nDose:--One to two teaspoonfuls.\\r\\n\\r\\n7. For one dose, or one capsule, the proportions would be:\\r\\n\\r\\n                                ONE        AMOUNT FOR\\r\\n                              CAPSULE       ONE DOZEN\\r\\n    Aloin                    1/4 grain       3 grains\\r\\n    Extract of Belladonna    1/8 grain       10 grains\\r\\n    Extract Nux Vomica       1/4 grain       3 grains\\r\\n    Powdered Gentian           3 grains     36 grains\\r\\n\\r\\nMix and put up in twelve capsules and take one at night.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are many tablets and pills made that can be bought at any drug\\r\\nstore. No doubt some of them are first class, though perhaps not attaining\\r\\nto that high degree of virtue claimed in their advertising columns.\\r\\n\\r\\n[144 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nITCHING OF THE ANUS. (Itching Piles) (Pruritus ani).Causes.--An inherited\\r\\nor an acquired nervous constitution. Disease of the colon, rectum or anus.\\r\\nImproper diet. Skin affections in that region. Operations about the rectum\\r\\nand anus with resulting discharge sometimes. Diseases in the neighboring\\r\\norgans. Disease of the general system. Diarrhea, discharge of mucus and\\r\\npus, fissure, etc. Irregular habits and dissipation. Over-seasoned foods\\r\\nsuch as lobster, salmon, shell-fish and foods containing much grease or\\r\\nstarch are especially conducive to it; the same is true of tea, coffee,\\r\\ncocoa, strong alcoholic drinks. Skin diseases, lice, pin worms often cause\\r\\nit.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Operations.--Some part has not healed, and there is left an\\r\\nirritating discharge.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--There is intense itching at the anus, increased by warmth, and\\r\\ncontact of the buttocks. The itching grows worse after the patient becomes\\r\\nwarm in bed. It may spread and extend to the scrotum, down the limbs and\\r\\nsometimes over the lower back.\\r\\n\\r\\nPHYSICIANS\\' TREATMENT FOR ITCHING OF ANUS. Preventive and Palliative.\\r\\n\\r\\nDIET.--May Take.--Strong drink must be prohibited; tea, coffee, cocoa, if\\r\\nused at all should be sparingly used. A light diet such as bread, milk,\\r\\neggs, nourishing soups, kumiss and a little fresh fish, broiled steak,\\r\\netc., may be used.\\r\\n\\r\\nMay Not Take--Hot cakes, pastry, parsnips, cheese, pickles, beans,\\r\\ncucumbers, cabbage, oatmeal, pork, shell-fish, salmon, lobster, salt fish,\\r\\nconfectionery and starchy or highly seasoned foods are to be prohibited.\\r\\nRegular meals, no lunches between meals, and the patient must not over-eat\\r\\nat any time. Long course dinners and over-indulgence in highly seasoned\\r\\nfoods and wines aggravate it.\\r\\n\\r\\nRemedies for Bath.--The bowels should move daily and the parts should be\\r\\nkept clean. The parts should be bathed with hot water or weak solutions of\\r\\ncarbolic acid, alcohol or listerine, the heat being especially soothing.\\r\\nBathing the parts with bran, oatmeal, flaxseed, salt, rice, slippery elm\\r\\nteas, or tar water adds much comfort to these parts. Do not wash much with\\r\\nsoapy water.\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Separate the Buttocks with Gauze, a thin layer of cotton or a piece of\\r\\nsoft cloth. This eases the soreness, pain and itching by absorbing the\\r\\nsecretions and preventing irritations while walking. The patient should\\r\\nnot scratch the parts. Direct pressure over the itching parts with a soft\\r\\ncloth, or by drawing a well oiled cloth across the sore parts several\\r\\ntimes gives relief.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Dr. Allingham Recommends the introduction of a bony or ivory\\r\\nnipple-shaped plug into the anus before going to bed. It is self\\r\\nretaining, about two inches in length, and as thick as the end of the\\r\\nindex finger. He claims it prevents the night itching by pressing upon the\\r\\nmany veins and terminal nerve fibres of the parts. When the rawness is\\r\\nextensive and the parts are highly inflamed, the patient should be kept to\\r\\nbed and kept on his back with the limbs separated until the irritation is\\r\\nallayed.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Local Applications.--Soothing remedies: These can be used when the\\r\\nparts are inflamed and raw. Lead and opium wash, or boric acid, or linseed\\r\\noil, or starch, or cocaine, and zinc stearate with boric acid. This form\\r\\nof zinc adheres to the parts when rubbed on, and is thus more valuable.\\r\\n\\r\\n[DIGESTIVE ORGANS 145]\\r\\n\\r\\n4. The following is good to dust in the parts:--\\r\\n\\r\\n    Boric Acid          2 drams\\r\\n    Stearate of Zinc    2 drams\\r\\n    Talcum              1 dram\\r\\n\\r\\nApply as a dusting powder.\\r\\n\\r\\n5.

(Hemorrhoids).--Hemorrhoid is derived from two Greek words, meaning\\r\\nblood and flowing with blood. \"Pile\" is from a Greek word meaning a ball\\r\\nor globe. Hemorrhoids, or piles, are varicose tumors involving the veins,\\r\\ncapillaries of the mucous membranes and tissue directly underneath the\\r\\nmucous membrane of the lower rectum, characterized by a tendency to bleed\\r\\nand protrude. They were known in the time of Moses.\\r\\n\\r\\nVarieties.--There are the external (covered by the skin) and the internal\\r\\n(covered by mucous membrane).\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses.--Heredity. More frequent in males. Women sometimes suffer from\\r\\nthem during pregnancy. Usually occurs between the ages of twenty-five and\\r\\nfifty. Sedentary life, irregular habits, high-grade wines and liquors, hot\\r\\nand highly seasoned and stimulating foods. Heavy lifting. Those who must\\r\\nremain on their feet long or sit on hard unventilated seats for several\\r\\nhours at a time. Railway employees, because they take their meals any time\\r\\nand cannot go to stool when Nature calls, causing constipation. Purgatives\\r\\nand enemata used often and for a long time. Constipation is perhaps the\\r\\nmost frequent cause: when a movement of the bowels is put off for a\\r\\nconsiderable time the feces accumulate and become hard and lumpy and\\r\\ndifficult to expel. If this hard mass is retained in the rectum, it\\r\\npresses upon the blood vessels interfering with their circulation and by\\r\\nbruising the vessels may induce an inflammation of the veins when the\\r\\nhardened feces are expelled; straining is intense, the mass closes the\\r\\nvessels above by pressure and forces the blood downward into the veins,\\r\\nproducing dilatation when the force is sufficient. One or more of the\\r\\nsmall veins near the anus may rupture and cause a bloody (vascular) tumor\\r\\nbeneath the mucous membrane or skin.\\r\\n\\r\\nExternal Piles.--Two kinds, venous piles and skin or simple enlarged tags\\r\\nof skin. Venous piles usually occur in robust persons. They come on\\r\\nsuddenly and are caused by the rupture of one or more small veins during\\r\\nthe expulsion of hardened feces. There may be one or more, and may be\\r\\nlocated just at the union of the mucous membrane and the skin. Their size\\r\\nis from a millet-seed to a cherry, livid or dark blue in color, and appear\\r\\nlike bullets or small shots under the skin. At first they cause a feeling\\r\\nof swelling at the margin of the anus; but as the clot becomes larger and\\r\\nharder, there is a feeling of the presence of a foreign body in the lower\\r\\npart of the anal canal (or canal of the anus). The sphincter muscle\\r\\nresents this and occasionally contracts, spasmodically at first, producing\\r\\na drawing feeling; later these contractions become longer and more\\r\\nfrequent, and there is intense suffering caused by the pile being\\r\\nsqueezed, and this suffering may be so great that sleep is impossible\\r\\nwithout an opiate. Because of the straining, irritation of the rectum and\\r\\npain in the sphincter, the piles soon become highly inflamed and very\\r\\nsensitive. The clot may be absorbed without any treatment. Occasionally it\\r\\nbecomes ulcerated from the irritation, infection takes place and an\\r\\nabscess forms around the margin of the anus terminating in a fistula.\\r\\n\\r\\n[DIGESTIVE ORGANS 147]\\r\\n\\r\\nSkin Piles. (Cutaneous).--These are enlarged tags of the skin. They\\r\\nfrequently follow the absorption of the clot in the venous piles where the\\r\\nskin is bruised and stretched. There may be one or many and usually have\\r\\nthe skin color. These cause less suffering than the venous variety, and\\r\\nsometimes they exist for years, without any trouble, providing care is\\r\\ntaken; but when bruised from any cause, such as a kick or fall, sitting on\\r\\na hard seat, stretching of the parts during stool, or when they become\\r\\nirritated by discharges from the rectum or vagina, they become inflamed\\r\\nand cause much annoyance and pain. When they are acutely inflamed they\\r\\nswell greatly, are highly colored, swollen, painful, and extremely\\r\\nsensitive to the touch and cause frequent spasmodic contractions of the\\r\\nsphincter muscle and may finally result in an abscess. The pain is usually\\r\\nconfined to the region of the anus, but may go up the back, down the limbs\\r\\nor to the privates.\\r\\n\\r\\nMOTHERS\\' REMEDIES FOR PILES.

Ointment of Stramomium       1-1/2 drams\\r\\n      Ointment of Belladonna       2-1/2 drams\\r\\n      Ointment of Tannic Acid        1/2 ounce\\r\\n\\r\\nMix thoroughly and apply inside and outside the anus.\\r\\n\\r\\n2.    Camphor Gum       1 dram\\r\\n      Calomel          12 grains\\r\\n      Vaselin           1 ounce\\r\\n\\r\\nThis must be thoroughly mixed. Apply freely within the anus and to the\\r\\npiles. Good for the pain.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. For External Piles cleanse them well with a sponge dipped in cold\\r\\nwater, and then bathe them with distilled extract of witch hazel.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. If there is much itching with the piles use the following salve:--\\r\\n\\r\\n      Menthol      20 grains\\r\\n      Calomel      30 grains\\r\\n      Vaselin       1 ounce\\r\\n\\r\\nMix and apply to the piles.\\r\\n\\r\\n5. I use quite frequently the following for sore external piles:\\r\\n\\r\\nChloroform and Sweet oil in equal parts\\r\\n\\r\\nApply freely with cotton or on to the piles. Ten cents will buy enough to\\r\\nuse.\\r\\n\\r\\n[DIGESTIVE ORGANS 149]\\r\\n\\r\\nOperation for Piles.--When these measures do not relieve the pains or the\\r\\npiles become inflamed from slight causes and often, it is best to operate.\\r\\nThis can be done in a few minutes with a local anesthetic and the patient\\r\\nfrequently goes to sleep afterward, almost free from pain. Inject a three\\r\\nper cent solution of eucaine, or six per cent solution of cocaine.\\r\\nThoroughly cleanse the part and hold the buttocks apart, pierce the pile\\r\\nat its base with a thin sharp-pointed curved knife, laying it open from\\r\\nside to side. Remove the clot with a curette, cauterize the vessel and\\r\\npack the cavity with gauze to prevent bleeding and to secure drainage.\\r\\n\\r\\nCutaneous (skin) piles are operated upon as follows.--Each one is grasped\\r\\nin turn with a pair of strong forceps and snipped off with the scissors,\\r\\nor removed with a knife. Close the wound with sutures, if necessary, and\\r\\ndress it with gauze. Small ones need no sutures. Be careful not to remove\\r\\ntoo much tissue. Much after-pain can be prevented by placing in the rectum\\r\\na suppository containing one-half grain of opium or cocaine before either\\r\\nof the above operations are performed. The after treatment is quite\\r\\nsimple. Keep the patient quiet, cleanse the parts frequently, and secure a\\r\\nsoft daily stool. Cleanse with tepid boiled water with clean sterilized\\r\\ngauze and give salts in small doses, one to two drams to produce a stool.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nINTERNAL PILES. Symptoms.--The two prominent symptoms are bleeding and\\r\\npain. The bleeding is usually dark. It may be slight and appear as streaks\\r\\nupon the feces or toilet paper; it may be moderate and ooze from the anus\\r\\nfor some time after a stool, or it may be so profuse as to cause the\\r\\npatient to faint from loss of blood while the \"bowels are moving.\" Death\\r\\nmay follow in such a case unless the bleeding is stopped. The blood may\\r\\nlook fresh and fluid or if retained for some time, it looks like coffee\\r\\ngrounds, sometimes mixed with mucus and pus. Patients who bleed profusely\\r\\nbecome pale and bloodless, and are very nervous and gloomy and they\\r\\nbelieve they are suffering from cancer or some other incurable trouble.\\r\\nThe first the patient notices he has internal piles is when a small lump\\r\\nappears at the end of the bowel during a stool and returns spontaneously;\\r\\nafterwards the lump again protrudes after the stool and others may appear.\\r\\nThey become larger and larger, come down oftener and no longer return\\r\\nspontaneously, but must be replaced after each stool. As a result of this\\r\\nhandling, they grow sensitive, swollen, inflamed and ulcerated, and the\\r\\nsphincter muscle becomes irritable. Later on one or more of the piles are\\r\\ncaught in the grasp of the sphincter muscle and rapidly increases in size.\\r\\nIt is then hard to relieve them, and when returned they act as foreign\\r\\nbodies, excite irritation and they are almost constantly expelled and the\\r\\nsame procedure goes on at each stool. The sphincter muscle contracts so\\r\\ntightly around them as to cause strangulation and unless properly treated\\r\\nthey become gangrenous and slough off.\\r\\n\\r\\n[150 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nRecovery, Pain, etc.--The pain is not great in the early stages, but when\\r\\nthe muscle grasps and contracts the pile or piles it becomes terrible and\\r\\nconstant. Piles rarely end fatally. Palliative treatment does not afford a\\r\\npermanent cure. They frequently return, but by care and diet many can be\\r\\nkept from returning so frequently. They should be treated upon their first\\r\\nappearance when the chances of a permanent cure without an operation are\\r\\nmuch better.\\r\\n\\r\\nPHYSICIANS\\' TREATMENT for Internal Piles.--What to do first. The cause\\r\\nshould be removed. Restore a displaced womb. Regulate the bowels, liver,\\r\\ndiet, and habits. Much can be accomplished by these measures if properly\\r\\nused, in allaying inflammation diminishing pain and reducing the size of\\r\\nthe piles. These measures will not cure them if they are large, overgrown\\r\\nand protruding. When the piles are inflamed, strangulated or ulcerated,\\r\\nthe patient should remain in bed in a recumbent position and hot\\r\\nfomentations of hops, etc., and hot poultices, of flaxseed, slippery elm,\\r\\nbread and milk, the ice bag, or soothing applications and astringent\\r\\nremedies, should be applied to the parts. In some cases cold applications\\r\\nare the best. The cold or astringent applications give the best results\\r\\nwhere the piles are simply inflamed and the sphincter muscle does not act\\r\\nspasmodically, jerkily. But when the piles are strangulated, \"choked\\r\\ntight\" by the sphincter muscle, hot fomentations, poultices and soothing\\r\\nremedies give the most relief, because they reduce spasmodic contractions\\r\\nof the muscle and allay the pain. Instead of the poultices and\\r\\nfomentations, the \"sitz\" bath can be used. Put in the steaming water,\\r\\nhops, catnip, tansy, pennyroyal, etc., and the steam arising will\\r\\nfrequently give great relief. This can be given frequently; ten to twenty\\r\\ndrops of laudanum can be added to the poultices when the piles are very\\r\\npainful.\\r\\n\\r\\n1. For inflamed piles, the following combinations may be used:--\\r\\n\\r\\n      Gum Camphor      1 dram\\r\\n      Calomel         12 grains\\r\\n      Vaselin          1 ounce\\r\\n\\r\\nMix thoroughly and apply freely around the anus and in the rectum on the\\r\\npiles.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe external parts should always be bathed with hot water, thoroughly,\\r\\nbefore using.\\r\\n\\r\\n2.    Gum Camphor              2 drams\\r\\n      Chloretone               1 dram\\r\\n      Menthol                 20 grains\\r\\n      Ointment of Zinc Oxide   1 ounce\\r\\n\\r\\nMix and apply directly to the piles.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. When there is a slight bleeding, water of witch-hazel extract, one to\\r\\ntwo ounces to be injected into the rectum. This witch-hazel water freely\\r\\nused is good for external piles also. This is good and well recommended.\\r\\n\\r\\n[DIGESTIVE ORGANS 151]\\r\\n\\r\\n4. If the protruded pile is inflamed and hard to push back, the following\\r\\nis good and recommended highly:--\\r\\n\\r\\n      Chloretone      1 dram\\r\\n      Iodoform        1 dram\\r\\n      Gum Camphor     1 dram\\r\\n      Petrolatum      1 ounce\\r\\n\\r\\nMix and use as a salve.\\r\\n\\r\\n5. An ointment composed of equal parts of fine-cut tobacco and raisins,\\r\\nseedless, chopped fine and mixed with enough lard, makes a good ointment\\r\\nto apply on both external and internal piles.\\r\\n\\r\\n6. Tea of white oak bark, boiled down so as to be strong, and mixed with\\r\\nlard and applied frequently, is good as an astringent, but not for the\\r\\nvery painful kind. It will take down the swelling.\\r\\n\\r\\n7. Take a rectal injection of cold water before the regular daily stool.\\r\\nThis will soften the feces and decrease the congestion.\\r\\n\\r\\nPreventive Treatment.--This is very important and includes habits and\\r\\ndiet and other diseases. If the patient is thin and pale give tonics.\\r\\nCorrect any disease of any neighboring organ. Attend to any disease that\\r\\nmay be present.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor Constipation.--Take a small dose of salts or hunyadi water so as to\\r\\nhave one semi-solid stool daily. If necessary remove any feces that may\\r\\neven then be retained, by injections of soap suds or warm water containing\\r\\noil. Discontinue injections as soon as a daily full stool can be had\\r\\nwithout it.\\r\\n\\r\\nHabits.--Full-blooded people should not use upholstered chairs as the heat\\r\\nof the body relaxes the tissues of the rectum. A cane seated chair is best\\r\\nor an air cushion with a hollow center. It is best to rest in bed, if\\r\\npossible, after stool for the rest relieves the congestion and soreness.\\r\\nAn abundance of out-door exercise, when the piles are not present, or bad,\\r\\nconsisting of walking or simple gymnastics may usually be indulged in;\\r\\nviolent gymnastics and horseback riding must be avoided. A daily stool\\r\\nmust be secured.\\r\\n\\r\\nDiet.--Such patients should avoid alcoholic beverages, spiced foods,\\r\\nstrong coffee, and tea, cheese, cabbage, and old beans.\\r\\n\\r\\nFoods Allowed.--Potatoes, carrots, spinach, asparagus, and even salads,\\r\\nsince they stimulate intestinal action and thus aid in keeping the stool\\r\\nsoft. Stewed fruits, including grapes, oranges, pears, and apples. Water\\r\\nis the best to drink. Meats: tender broiled, boiled or baked beef--do not\\r\\neat the inside part to any great amount. Other meats, but no pork or ham,\\r\\nfresh fish, chicken. The foods should not be too highly seasoned; vinegar\\r\\nis not to be used to any extent and this excludes pickles, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nPERIPROCTITIS. Abscess Around the Anus and Rectum. (Ano-rectal) (Ischio-\\r\\nrectal Abscess).--This is an inflammation of the tissues around the rectum\\r\\nwhich usually terminates in the above named abscess. It occurs mostly in\\r\\nmiddle-aged people. Men are affected more often than women.\\r\\n\\r\\n[152 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses.--Sitting in cold, damp hard seats; horseback riding, foreign\\r\\nbodies in the rectum such as pins, fish-hooks, etc., blows on the part,\\r\\nkicks, tubercular constitution, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--Inflammation of the skin, like that of a big boil, some fever,\\r\\nthrobbing pain, swelling of the part, heat and fullness in the rectum,\\r\\nthese symptoms increase until the pus finds an outlet into the rectum.\\r\\n\\r\\nPHYSICIANS\\' TREATMENT for Periproctitis.--Little can be done in a\\r\\npalliative way. It generally terminates in an abscess. Make the patient as\\r\\ncomfortable as possible, by applying cold or hot things to the part, rest\\r\\nin bed, mild laxatives to keep the bowels open. Cut it open as soon as\\r\\npossible, and it should be laid wide open, so that every part is broken\\r\\nup. Then it should be thoroughly washed and scraped out. Sometimes it is\\r\\nnecessary to use pure carbolic acid to burn out the interior. The dressing\\r\\nshould be as usual for such wounds and removed when soiled and the wound\\r\\nwashed out with boiled water and then gauze loosely placed in the bottom\\r\\nand in every corner of the wound. The dressing should be continued until\\r\\nall has been healed from inside out. Be sure to leave no cotton in to heal\\r\\nover it. Such patients should be built up with nourishing foods, and\\r\\nshould remain quietly in bed. Cod liver oil is good for some patients.\\r\\nIron, etc., for others. Keep the bowels regular. Outdoor life and\\r\\nexercise. If treated right it should not return.\\r\\n\\r\\nFISTULA IN ANUS.--This usually follows the abscess. It has two openings,\\r\\none upon the surface of the body near the anus, and the other in the\\r\\nrectum. There are a great many varieties of fistula, but it is unnecessary\\r\\nto name them. What can be done for them?\\r\\n\\r\\nPHYSICIANS\\' TREATMENT.--If the general health is good an operation is the\\r\\nbest thing to do, but patients in the last stage of consumption,\\r\\nnephritis, diabetes, or organic heart disease, are not apt to receive much\\r\\nbenefit from an operation. The patient in poor condition should be given\\r\\nthe treatment suitable to his condition, according to the advice of a\\r\\ntrusted physician.\\r\\n\\r\\n[KIDNEY AND BLADDER 153]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDISEASES OF THE KIDNEYS AND BLADDER.\\r\\n\\r\\nKIDNEYS.--The kidneys are deeply placed and cannot be felt or distinctly\\r\\nidentified when normal. They are most accessible to pressure just below\\r\\nthe last rib, behind. The right kidney usually lies lower than does the\\r\\nleft, but even then, the lower part of this kidney is an inch above the\\r\\nupper part of the hip bone, or an inch above a line drawn around the body\\r\\nparallel with the navel. The kidney is about four inches long. The long\\r\\naxis of the kidneys corresponds to that of the twelfth rib; on an average\\r\\nthe left kidney lies one-half inch higher than the right.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Kidneys, Ureters and Bladder.]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs stated before, each kidney is four inches long, two to two and one-half\\r\\nin breadth, and more than one inch thick. The left is somewhat longer,\\r\\nthough narrower, than the right. The kidney is covered with what is called\\r\\na capsule. This can be easily stripped off. The structure of the kidney is\\r\\nquite intricate. At the inner border of each kidney there is an opening\\r\\ncalled the pelvis of the kidney, and leading from this, small tubes\\r\\npenetrate the structure of the kidney in all directions. These tubes are\\r\\nlined with special cells. Through these tubes go the excretions (urine)\\r\\nfrom the body of the kidneys, to the pelvis, and from the pelvis through\\r\\nthe ureters, sixteen inches long, to the bladder.\\r\\n\\r\\n[154 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nKIDNEY TROUBLE. MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES.--1. Kidney Trouble and Inflammation of\\r\\nthe Bladder, Cornsilk for.--\"Get cornsilk and make a good strong tea of it\\r\\nby steeping slowly, and take one ounce three or four times a day. This\\r\\nacts well on the kidneys, and is a harmless remedy to use.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Kidney Trouble, Flaxseed and Lemons for.--\"Make a tea by placing the\\r\\nflaxseed in a muslin or linen bag, and suspend it in a dish of water, in\\r\\nthe proportion of about four teaspoonfuls for each quart of water. After\\r\\nallowing the seeds to soak for several hours remove the same and tea will\\r\\nbe ready for use. The addition of a little lemon juice will improve the\\r\\nflavor. Give in quantities as may be found necessary.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Kidney Trouble, Temporary Relief for.--\"Rub witchhazel on stomach and\\r\\nback; use freely.\" This is an old-time remedy, and can be relied upon to\\r\\nat least give temporary relief. The witch hazel has a very soothing effect\\r\\nupon the parts affected.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Kidney and Bladder Trouble, Buchu Leaves for.--\"Get five cents\\' worth\\r\\nof buchu leaves at any drug store, and make a good strong tea of it by\\r\\nsteeping. This acts nicely on the kidneys. This remedy is easily prepared,\\r\\nand is not expensive.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n5. Kidney Trouble, Common Rush Root for.--\"Take a handful of the root of\\r\\ncommon rush in one and one-half pints of water, boil down to one pint.\\r\\nDose:--One tablespoonful every two or three hours. For a child ten years,\\r\\ngive one teaspoonful four times a day. For a child of four to six years,\\r\\none-half teaspoonful four times a day.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n6. Kidney Trouble, Effective and Easy Cure for.--\\r\\n\\r\\n    \"Fluid Extract of Cascara Sagrada      1 ounce\\r\\n    Fluid Extract of Buchu                 2 ounces\\r\\n    Fluid Extract of Uva Ursi              2 ounces\\r\\n    Tincture Gentian Comp                  1 ounce\\r\\n    Simple Syrup                           1 pint\\r\\n\\r\\nMix the above ingredients and give a teaspoonful four times a day. This is\\r\\na very good remedy, as the cascara sagrada acts on the bowels and the\\r\\nbuchu and uva ursi acts on the kidneys, carrying off all the impurities\\r\\nthat would otherwise be retained in the system and cause trouble.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n7. Kidney Trouble, Sheep-Sorrel Excellent for.--\"Make a decoction of sheep\\r\\nsorrel, one ounce to pint of water; boil, strain and cool. Give\\r\\nwineglassful, three or four times a day. If necessary apply the spinal ice\\r\\nbag to kidneys.\" The sheep sorrel is a good kidney remedy, and the ice bag\\r\\nby continuous application will relieve the congestion.\\r\\n\\r\\n[KIDNEY AND BLADDER 155]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMOVABLE KIDNEY. (Floating Kidney. Nephroptosis).--Causes.--This condition\\r\\nis usually acquired. It is more common in women than in men, possibly due\\r\\nto lacing and the relaxations of the muscles of the abdomen from\\r\\npregnancy. It may come from wounds, lifting too heavy articles,\\r\\nemaciation.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--They are often absent. There may be pain or dragging sensation\\r\\nin the loins, or intercostal neuralgia; hysteria, nervousness, nervous\\r\\ndyspepsia and constipation are common. The kidney can be felt. A dull pain\\r\\nis caused by firm pressure. Sometimes there are attacks of severe\\r\\nabdominal pain, with chill, fever, nausea, vomiting and collapse. The\\r\\nkidney becomes large and tender. The urine shows a reddish deposit and\\r\\nsometimes there is blood and pus in the urine.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--If the symptoms are not present, it is best for the patient\\r\\nnot to know the true condition, as nervous troubles frequently follow a\\r\\nknowledge of its presence. If the symptoms are present, replace the kidney\\r\\nwhile the patient is lying down and retain it by a suitable belt. Also\\r\\ntreat the nervous condition. If the symptoms are of the severe kind an\\r\\noperation may be needed to fasten the kidney in its proper condition. This\\r\\nis quite generally successful, and does away with much suffering and pain.\\r\\nThe pain may be so severe at times as to require morphine. Sometimes the\\r\\npain is due to uric acid or oxalates in the urine. For this regulate the\\r\\ndiet.\\r\\n\\r\\nDiet for Movable Kidney.--The diet should be such as to produce fat. Milk\\r\\nis excellent where it is well borne; if not well borne give easily\\r\\ndigested meats, such as chicken, roast beef, broiled steak and lamb chop;\\r\\nfish of various kinds and vegetables, such as spinach, carrots, asparagus\\r\\nand cauliflower; of fats, butter, cream, and chocolate; for constipation,\\r\\ncider, buttermilk, grape-juice, fruits and honey.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nACUTE CONGESTION OR HYPEREMIA OF THE KIDNEYS.--This occurs at the\\r\\nbeginning of acute nephritis; in acute infectious diseases, after taking\\r\\nturpentine, chlorate of potash, cantharides, carbolic acid, alcohol, etc.;\\r\\nafter one kidney has been removed.\\r\\n\\r\\nKidney.--The kidney is enlarged, dark red, while the covering is very\\r\\ntight (tense). The urine is scanty, and there is increased specific\\r\\ngravity (normal is 1015 to 1020) and contains albumin and a few casts.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--The cause should always be removed if possible. Rest in bed,\\r\\nand as a diet use only milk; if the congestion is bad, use dry cupping\\r\\nover the kidneys and inject large quantities of hot normal salt solution\\r\\nin the bowels. Hot fomentations of wormwood or smartweed are of benefit.\\r\\nIf you can get the patient into a sweat the congestion will be somewhat\\r\\nrelieved by it.\\r\\n\\r\\n[156 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHRONIC CONGESTION OF THE KIDNEYS. Causes.--Diseases of other organs and\\r\\nobstruction to the return of the circulation in the veins. Cirrhosis of\\r\\nthe liver causes it. The kidney is enlarged dark red, the urine is\\r\\ndiminished, with albumin and casts and sometimes blood.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--Remove the cause if possible. Fluid diet, like milk, broths,\\r\\netc. Dry cupping or sweating materials can be used. Rest in bed if\\r\\npossible. The bowels should be kept open, and the kidneys should rest.\\r\\n\\r\\nBLOOD IN THE URINE. (Haematuria). Causes.--The congestion of the kidneys,\\r\\npernicious malaria, etc., nephritis, tuberculosis, kidney stones. The\\r\\nurine looks smoky and dark, or bright red.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--This depends upon the cause. The patient must rest in bed and\\r\\nthe kidneys should not be stimulated. Cold applications to the loins. Hot\\r\\napplications would injure.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nURAEMIC TOXAEMIA.--This means poison in the blood occurring in acute and\\r\\nchronic nephritis (inflammation of the kidneys). The cause is unknown. The\\r\\ndisease is acute and chronic.\\r\\n\\r\\nACUTE URAEMIA. Symptoms.--The onset may be sudden or gradual. The headache\\r\\nis severe, usually on the back top of head (occipital) and extending to\\r\\nthe neck; there is persistent vomiting with nausea and diarrhea attending\\r\\nit. This may be due to inflammation of the colon. Difficulty in breathing,\\r\\nwhich may be constant or comes in spells. This is worse at night, when it\\r\\nmay resemble asthma; fever if persistent, is usually slight until just\\r\\nbefore death. General convulsions may occur. There may be some twitching\\r\\nof the muscles of the face and of other muscles. The convulsions may occur\\r\\nfrequently. The patient becomes abnormally sleepy, before the attack, and\\r\\nremains so. One-sided paralysis may occur. Sudden temporary blindness\\r\\noccurs sometimes. There may be noisy delirium or suicidal mania. Coma\\r\\n(deep sleep) may develop either with or without convulsions or delirium,\\r\\nand is usually soon followed by them; sometimes by chronic uraemia or\\r\\nrecovery.\\r\\n\\r\\nCHRONIC URAEMIA.--This develops most often in cases of Arterio-sclerosis\\r\\nor chronic interstitial nephritis, (one kind of Bright\\'s disease). The\\r\\nsymptoms are less severe than those of acute uraemia, but similar, and of\\r\\ngradual onset, sometimes with symptoms of the acute attack. There is often\\r\\nconstant headache and difficult breathing; the tongue is brown and dry,\\r\\nsometimes there is nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, sleeplessness, cramps of\\r\\nthe legs and much itching may be present. It may last for years. Death may\\r\\noccur when the patient is in coma (deep sleep). There may have been mania,\\r\\nmuscular twitchings or convulsions before death.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--Found under \"Chronic Interstitial Nephritis.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[KIDNEY AND BLADDER 157]\\r\\n\\r\\nACUTE BRIGHT\\'S DISEASE. (Acute Inflammation of the Kidneys.

Sometimes there is nausea,\\r\\nvomiting, headache, delirium, or very deep sleep. The urine is scanty,\\r\\ndark colored, of increased \"specific gravity\" and contains albumin, cells\\r\\nand casts. Anemia is marked. After some fever disease, the onset is\\r\\ngradual with anemia, swelling of the eyelids, face and extremities; scanty\\r\\nthickish urine containing casts, then headache, nausea, vomiting, little\\r\\nor no fever, dry skin. In these cases there may be gradual recovery,\\r\\nattack of uraemia, or they may end in chronic nephritis.\\r\\n\\r\\nDiagnosis.--Examine the urine often in pregnancy, scarlet fever, etc., and\\r\\nespecially when watery swelling is noticed.\\r\\n\\r\\nRecovery.--The result in your children when it comes with scarlet fever is\\r\\nnot so good. It may run into chronic nephritis. In adults when it is due\\r\\nto exposure the rule is recovery.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--The patient must be kept in bed until there is complete\\r\\nrecovery. He should be clothed in flannel.\\r\\n\\r\\nDiet and Nursing.--This must be of milk, water or mineral water in large\\r\\nquantities; milk or buttermilk should be the main article of food. You can\\r\\ngive gruels made of arrowroot or oatmeal, barley water, beef tea and\\r\\nchicken broth. But it is better to stick strictly to milk. As the patient\\r\\ngets better, bread and butter, lettuce, watercress, grapes, oranges, and\\r\\nother fruits may be given. The return to a meat diet should be gradual.\\r\\nThe patient should drink freely of mineral waters, ordinary water or\\r\\nlemonade, these keep the kidneys flushed and wash out the \"debris\" from\\r\\nthe tubes. One dram of cream of tartar in a pint of boiling water, add the\\r\\njuice of half a lemon and a little sugar; this when taken cold is a\\r\\npleasant satisfactory diluting drink. Cream of tartar one dram, juice of\\r\\nlemon, sugar sufficient, water one pint, may be given whenever desired.\\r\\nThere should be hot water baths daily or oftener; or you can produce\\r\\nsweating by placing hot water jars around the patient, and watch to see\\r\\nwhether it is too weakening. It can also be done by introducing steam\\r\\nunderneath the bedding, that is then lifted a little, so that the steam\\r\\nvapor can circulate about the patient. Be careful not to burn the patient\\r\\nwith the hot steam. This, of course, is done through a hose attached to a\\r\\nsteaming kettle. Also see treatment of dropsy under \"scarlet fever.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBowels, Attention to.--They should be moved every morning by a saline\\r\\n(salt) cathartic, if necessary, especially if the dropsy continues.

There is moderate increase of interstitial tissue. In other\\r\\ncases, the \"small white kidney,\" the kidney is small and pale either at\\r\\nfirst or as a later stage of the large white kidney. The surface is pale,\\r\\nrough and granular; the capsule is thickened and partially adherent; the\\r\\nsurface is thin with white and yellowish areas of fatty degenerations. The\\r\\ninterstitial tissue is much increased; epithelial degeneration in the\\r\\ntubules extensive. There is also the large red kidney, and with any of\\r\\nthese types the left heart may be enlarged and the arteries thickened.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--If it occurs after acute nephritis the symptoms of acute\\r\\nnephritis subside, but anemia and the changes in the urine persist.\\r\\nUsually there is a gradual onset with paleness and puffiness of the\\r\\neyelids, ankles or hands in the morning. Later there is difficult\\r\\nbreathing, increased watery swelling of the face, extremities and\\r\\ndependent portions of the body; worse in the morning. There is a pasty\\r\\nyellowish pallor, afterwards dropsy of the abdominal and chest cavities.\\r\\nThe urine is diminished, high colored, specific gravity usually 1020 to\\r\\n1025 with much albumin. Many casts which are named hyaline, granular,\\r\\nepithelial and fatty. The action of the heart is bad. There may be trouble\\r\\nwith the stomach and bowels, constipated, etc. The digestion is poor and\\r\\nthe patient frequently suffers with much gas. Recovery is rare after it\\r\\nhas lasted one year.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment. Diet.--Milk or buttermilk should be the main article of food.\\r\\nYou can give gruels made of arrowroot or oatmeal, barley water, beef tea,\\r\\nand chicken broth, but it is better to keep strictly to milk. As the\\r\\npatient gets better, bread and butter, lettuce, watercress, grapes,\\r\\noranges and other fruits may be given. The return to the meat diet should\\r\\nbe gradual. The patient should drink freely of mineral water, ordinary\\r\\nwater, or lemonade. These keep the kidneys flushed and wash out the\\r\\n\"debris\" from the tubes. One dram (teaspoonful) of cream of tartar in a\\r\\npint of boiling water, add the juice of a half a lemon and a little sugar.\\r\\nThis when taken cold is a pleasant, satisfactory drink. Medical treatment\\r\\nis not satisfactory. The only thing to do is to give medicines to meet the\\r\\nindications; fifteen to twenty grain doses of lactate of strontium.\\r\\nDiuretin also is used. Basham\\'s mixture for anemia is of help in some\\r\\ncases. It can be bought at any drug store.\\r\\n\\r\\n[KIDNEY AND BLADDER 159]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHRONIC INTERSTITIAL NEPHRITIS. (Sclerosis or Cirrhosis of the Kidneys.\\r\\nGranular, Contracted or Gouty Kidney).--This is met with, (a) as a\\r\\nsequence of the large white kidneys forming the so-called pale granular or\\r\\nsecondary contracted kidney; (b) as an independent primary affection; as a\\r\\nsequence of arterio-sclerosis.\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses.--The primary form is chronic from the onset, and is a slow\\r\\ncreeping degeneration of the kidney substance, and in many respects an\\r\\nanticipation of the gradual changes which take place in the organ in\\r\\nextreme old age. Families in which the arteries tend to degenerate early\\r\\nare more prone to this disease. Doctor Osler says: \"Among the better\\r\\nclasses in this country Bright\\'s disease is very common and is caused more\\r\\nfrequently by over-eating than by excesses in alcohol.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nArterio-Sclerotic Form.--This is the most common form in this country, and\\r\\nis secondary to arterio-sclerosis. The kidneys are not much, if at all,\\r\\ncontracted; very hard, red and show patches of surface atrophy. It is seen\\r\\nin men over forty who have worked hard, eaten freely, and taken alcohol to\\r\\nexcess. They are conspicuous victims of the \"strenuous life,\" the\\r\\nincessant tension of which is felt first in the arteries. After forty, in\\r\\nmen of this class, nothing is more salutary than to experience the shock\\r\\nbrought on by the knowledge of albumin and cast tubes in the urine.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--Perhaps a majority of the cases are latent (hidden) and are not\\r\\nrecognized until the occurrence of one of the serious and fatal\\r\\ncomplications. There may have been no symptoms to suggest to the patient\\r\\nthe existence of a dangerous malady. In other cases the general health is\\r\\ndisturbed. The patient is tired, sleepless; he must get up two or three\\r\\ntimes at night to pass urine; the digestion is disordered, the tongue is\\r\\ncoated; the patient complains of a headache, failing sight, and gets out\\r\\nof breath by exercising. There may be vomiting, headache, neuralgia, and\\r\\nincrease of the quantity of urine is common. This is light in color, of\\r\\nlow specific gravity, 1005 to 1012; frequently there is a trace of albumin\\r\\nand a few casts of the hyaline and granular kind. In the late stages the\\r\\nalbumin may be increased with high specific gravity and a less quantity of\\r\\nurine. The disease often lasts for a year.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the arterio-sclerotic variety the urine may be normal or diminished in\\r\\nquantity, specific gravity normal or increased, the casts are more\\r\\nnumerous, and the albumin is usually more abundant. There is an\\r\\nenlargement of the heart; the pulse is increased in tension; the wall of\\r\\nthe artery is thickened. The skin is usually dry, with eczema common, but\\r\\ndropsy is rare, except when it is due to heart failure. There may be\\r\\nbronchial and lung troubles; attacks of uraemia, or hard breathing caused\\r\\nby the heart, frequently occurs. There may be hemorrhage of the brain or\\r\\nhemorrhage of the membranes, and these are often fatal.\\r\\n\\r\\n[160 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nRecovery.--Chances are unfavorable, but life may be prolonged for years,\\r\\nespecially with care and especially if it is discovered early.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--A quiet life without mental worry, with gentle but not\\r\\nexcessive exercise, and residence in a climate that is not changeable\\r\\nshould be recommended. A business man must give up his worry; his rush;\\r\\nhis hurried eating, and rest. The bowels should be kept regular; there\\r\\nshould be a tepid water bath daily, and the kidneys should be kept acting\\r\\nfreely by drinking daily a definite amount of either distilled water or\\r\\nsome pleasant mineral water. Alcohol, tobacco, excessive eating and\\r\\nimproper food must not be allowed. Weak tea and coffee may be allowed. The\\r\\ndiet should be light and nourishing. Meat should not be taken more than\\r\\nonce a day. If it is possible, the patient should be urged to move to a\\r\\nwarm equable climate during the winter months, from November to April,\\r\\nlike that of southern California. Medicines must be given to meet the\\r\\nindications. No special directions can be given. The heart, stomach, and\\r\\nbowels must be watched.\\r\\n\\r\\nDIET as Allowed by a Prominent Hospital.--\\r\\n\\r\\nMay Take:--\\r\\n\\r\\nSoups.--Broths with rice or barley, vegetable or fish soup.\\r\\n\\r\\nFish.--Boiled or broiled fresh fish, raw oysters, raw clams.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeats.--Chicken, game, fat bacon, fat ham (sparingly).\\r\\n\\r\\nFarinaceous.--Hominy, oatmeal, wheaten grits, rice, stale bread, whole\\r\\nwheat bread, toast, milk toast, biscuits, maccaroni.\\r\\n\\r\\nVegetables.--Cabbage, spinach, celery, water-cresses, lettuce, mushrooms,\\r\\nmashed potatoes, cauliflower, onions.\\r\\n\\r\\nDesserts.--Rice and milk puddings, stewed fruits, raw ripe fruits.\\r\\n\\r\\nMust Not Take:--\\r\\n\\r\\nFried fish, pork, corned beef, veal, heavy bread, hashes, stews,\\r\\nbattercakes, lamb, beef, mutton, gravies, peas, beans, pastry, ice cream,\\r\\ncakes, coffee, tobacco, malt or spirituous liquors.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[KIDNEY AND BLADDER 161]\\r\\n\\r\\nPYELITIS.--This is an inflammation of the pelvis of the kidney and may be\\r\\ncaused by bacteria from the blood, or by ascending pus, infection or\\r\\ntuberculous infection from the lower tracts like the ureter, bladder and\\r\\nurethra.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--There is pain in the back, with tenderness and pressure,\\r\\ncloudy-looking urine, either acid or alkaline, containing pus, mucus, and\\r\\nsometimes red blood cells; chills, high fever, and sweating occur. This\\r\\nmay become chronic and then it becomes quite serious. Anemia and\\r\\nemaciation are then marked. Mild cases usually recover; pus cases may end\\r\\nin other diseases or death from exhaustion.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment. Diet.--In mild cases fluids should be taken freely,\\r\\nparticularly the alkaline mineral water to which citrate of potash can be\\r\\nadded. Tonics should be given when called for, and milk diet and\\r\\nbuttermilk may be taken freely. When a tumor has formed, and even before,\\r\\nit is perceptible, if the symptoms are serious and severe, an operation\\r\\nmay be necessary.\\r\\n\\r\\nKIDNEY STONE. (Renal Calculus. Nephro-Leithiasis).--Forming of a stone or\\r\\ngravel in the kidney or its pelvis may occur in intra uterine, (before the\\r\\nchild is born), in the womb, or at any age. A family tendency, sedentary\\r\\nlife, excesses in eating and drinking and very acid urine predispose. They\\r\\nvary in size from that of fine sand to that of a bean.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--Patients may pass gravel for years without having an attack of\\r\\nrenal (kidney) colic, and a stone may never lodge in the ureter. A person\\r\\nmay pass an enormous number of calculi. Dr. Osler speaks of having had a\\r\\npatient who had passed several hundred kidney stones (calculi) with\\r\\nrepeated attacks of kidney colic. His collection filled an ounce bottle. A\\r\\npatient may pass a single stone and may never be troubled again. A stone\\r\\nremaining in the kidney may cause dull aching pain in the affected kidney,\\r\\nor the pain may be referred to the other side and sometimes there may be\\r\\nblood or pus in the urine, with chill and fever due to pyelitis. Kidney\\r\\n(renal) colic comes on when a stone enters the ureter, if it is at all\\r\\nlarge. At attack may set in abruptly, without any apparent reason, or it\\r\\nmay follow a strain in lifting. The pain may be agonizing in character,\\r\\nwhich starts in the flank of the affected side, passes down along the\\r\\ncourse of the ureter and is felt in the testicle and along the inner side\\r\\nof the thighs. The testicle is drawn back. The pain may also go through\\r\\nthe abdomen and chest, and be very severe in the back. In severe attacks\\r\\nnausea and vomiting are present and the patient is collapsed; sweating\\r\\nbreaks out in his face and the pulse is feeble and weak. The pain lasts\\r\\nfrom an hour to several days, until the stone reaches the bladder, partial\\r\\nsuppression of the urine during the attack occurs, but a large quantity of\\r\\nurine is usually passed after it and a feeling of soreness may, be present\\r\\nfor several days. The stone may again cause pain in passing through the\\r\\nurethra, or it may remain in the bladder as a nucleus for a bladder\\r\\ncalculus (stone). Dr. Osler gives Montaigne\\'s description as follows;\\r\\n\"Thou art seen to sweat with pain, to look pale and red, to tremble, to\\r\\nvomit well nigh to blood, to suffer strange contortions and convulsions,\\r\\nby starts to let tears drop from thine eyes, to urine thick, black and\\r\\nfrightful water, or to have it suppressed by some sharp and craggy stone\\r\\nthat cruelly pricks and tears thee.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n[162 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--Great relief is experienced in the attacks by the hot baths or\\r\\nfomentations which sometimes are able to cause the spasm to relax. If the\\r\\npain is very severe morphine should be given by the hypodermic method and\\r\\ninhalations of chloroform given until morphine has had time to act. Local\\r\\napplications are sometimes grateful,--hot poultices or cloths wrung out of\\r\\nhot water may be helpful. Cloths wrung out of steaming hop, wormwood, or\\r\\nsmartweed teas, are of benefit sometimes. Change of position often gives\\r\\nrelief; when the stone is large an operation may be needed. The patient\\r\\nshould drink freely of hot lemonade, soda water, barley water. When the\\r\\npatient is free from the attack, he should live a quiet life and avoid\\r\\nsudden exertion of all kinds. There should be a free passage of urine\\r\\nalways. The patient should drink daily a large but definite quantity of\\r\\nmineral, or distilled water which is just as satisfactory. You may take\\r\\nthe citrate or bicarbonate of potash. Mineral springs are good to visit,\\r\\nsuch as Saratoga, Hot Springs, Arkansas, etc. Abstain from alcohol and eat\\r\\nmoderately. Live an open-air life with plenty of exercise and regular\\r\\nhours. The skin should be kept active; a cold friction bath in the morning\\r\\nis good, if one is strong; but if he is weak and debilitated the evening\\r\\nwarm bath should be substituted. The patient should dress warmly, avoid\\r\\nrapid alterations in temperature, and be careful not to allow the skin to\\r\\nbecome suddenly chilled.\\r\\n\\r\\nDiet.--Most persons over forty eat too much. One should take plenty of\\r\\ntime to eat, and not too much meat should be eaten.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Queen of the Meadow.\"--The Indians used this medicine quite frequently in\\r\\nthe treatment of kidney and bladder troubles. A lady, whom I know well,\\r\\ntold me that she had a cousin who was affected with the kidney stone\\r\\ncolic. At one time, when he was suffering from an attack, an Indian\\r\\nhappened in their home and saw him suffering. He went into the meadow and\\r\\ndug some of this remedy and made a tea of it. It seemed to do the work,\\r\\nfor while he gave it, the pain was eased and he never had any more\\r\\nattacks. I give this for what it is worth. The remedy will certainly do no\\r\\nharm for it is a good diuretic.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nINFLAMMATION OF THE BLADDER. (Cystitis). Causes.--It may occur from injury\\r\\nfrom passing a catheter, etc., from the use of drugs like cantharides,\\r\\nfrom the presence of a stone, from stricture of the urethra and from\\r\\ngonorrhea or cold.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--The urine is passed more frequently, sometimes the desire to\\r\\npass the urine is almost constant. The distress is relieved for only a few\\r\\nminutes by passing the urine; sometimes only a few drops are passed, and\\r\\nit gives no relief from the desire for passing urine. The straining is\\r\\nextremely severe. Sometimes the patient will lean over the vessel\\r\\nquivering with the muscular effort to pass urine. The bowels often move at\\r\\nthe same time from the straining. The urine becomes thick with much mucus,\\r\\nthen scanty, and then tinged with blood.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[KIDNEY AND BLADDER 163]\\r\\n\\r\\nBLADDER TROUBLE. Mothers\\' Remedies. 1. English Oil of Sandal Wood\\r\\nfor.--\"Get one ounce of the pure English oil of sandal wood, take four\\r\\ndrops three times a day in a little water. As you urinate more freely\\r\\nreduce the dose. This is a splendid remedy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Bladder Trouble, Effective Herb Teas for.--\"Make a tea of half ounce of\\r\\nbuchu leaves, half ounce of uva ursi leaves (barberry leaves), one pint of\\r\\nboiling water. Dose: Two or three tablespoonfuls three times a day, or may\\r\\ndrink quite freely.\" A tea made of cornsilk is a common and standard\\r\\nremedy.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--Remove cause if possible. Fomentations of hops, smartweed,\\r\\nwormwood are good, even hot water over the bladder. Hot hip bath is good,\\r\\nand also the warm foot bath. The bowels should be kept open with saline\\r\\nlaxatives. Buchu tea is very good. Use about one-half ounce of the leaves\\r\\nto a pint of warm water and let it steep, not boil. Drink freely of this.\\r\\nPumpkin seed tea or watermelon seed tea is good, also flaxseed tea. Dr.\\r\\nHare recommends the following at the beginning if there is fever:\\r\\n\\r\\n    Tincture of Aconite             3 drams\\r\\n    Sweet Spirits of Nitre          1 ounce\\r\\n    Solution of Citrate of Potash   enough to make 6 ounces\\r\\n\\r\\nMix.\\r\\n\\r\\nGive a dessertspoonful every four hours until all fever ceases and the\\r\\npulse is quiet. The patient should be kept quiet.\\r\\n\\r\\nDiet.--Should be milk only.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHRONIC INFLAMMATION OF THE BLADDER.--Causes.--It follows repeated\\r\\nattacks; partial retention of urine in the bladder, decomposing there;\\r\\nBright\\'s disease, inflammation of the urethra, injury, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--Wash out the bladder with pure warm water or water containing\\r\\nabout one to two teaspoonfuls of boric acid to the pint of warm water.\\r\\nThis should be given once or twice a day; or enough permanganate of potash\\r\\ncan be put into the water to give the water a tinge of the color. An\\r\\ninjection of golden seal, one teaspoonful to the pint of warm water, is\\r\\ngood if there is much mucus. The best way to give the irrigation is to\\r\\nattach a small funnel to a soft rubber catheter and fill the bladder by\\r\\nraising the funnel when full of water above the patient\\'s belly; or you\\r\\ncan attach the rubber tube of a fountain syringe to a catheter at one end\\r\\nand to a funnel at the other and raise the funnel to the desired height;\\r\\nor you can attach a catheter to the rubber tube of a fountain syringe\\r\\n(clean one) and raise syringe high enough to allow the water to run into\\r\\nthe bladder gently. The patient will stand just about so much water. The\\r\\nrubber can then be detached from the catheter and the water allowed to run\\r\\nout.\\r\\n\\r\\n[164 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nDISEASE OF THE PROSTATE GLAND. The prostate, which both in structure and\\r\\nin function is rather a muscle than a gland, is situated at the neck of\\r\\nthe bladder and around the first inch of the urethra. It is divided into\\r\\ntwo lateral (side) lobes (parts) by a deep notch behind and a furrow at\\r\\nthe upper and lower surfaces. The so-called middle or third lobe is the\\r\\nportion which is between the two side lobes at the under and posterior\\r\\npart of the gland, just beneath the neck of the bladder. The urethra (the\\r\\nchannel for the urine to pass through from the bladder out through the\\r\\npenis) usually passes through the gland at about the junction of its upper\\r\\nand middle third.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHYPERTROPHY OF THE PROSTATE.--This is a general enlargement of the gland\\r\\nin all directions. All the three lobes may enlarge and in about one-third\\r\\nof the men who have passed middle life some enlargement takes place, and\\r\\nin about one-tenth of all men over fifty-five this enlargement becomes of\\r\\nimportance in regard to the size. The middle lobe may enlarge so much that\\r\\nit may extend up into the bladder and block the opening into the urethra;\\r\\nthe side lobes may compress the urethra into a mere slit, or may lengthen\\r\\nit so that the prostatic portion measures three or four inches, or may\\r\\ntwist and distort it so that the most flexible instrument can only be made\\r\\nto pass through it with difficulty.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--The earliest symptom may be increased frequency in passing\\r\\nurine, especially at night. Soon some urine is retained in the bladder,\\r\\nand this may increase so much that only an ounce or two can be passed\\r\\nspontaneously, although the bladder contains one pint or more. The stream\\r\\nof urine is feeble, and will drop perpendicularly towards the feet of the\\r\\npatient. In some cases an inflammation of the prostate and bladder is set\\r\\nup, and then the symptoms felt are very distressing. There is an almost\\r\\nconstant desire to pass urine; there is much pain and straining with it; a\\r\\nslight bleeding may follow and night rest is broken; the general strength\\r\\nfails from the continual suffering; the urine becomes foul, smells like\\r\\nammonia, and is reduced in quantity; inflammation of the kidneys develops\\r\\nalso; general poisoning occurs; and the patient dies of uraemia and in a\\r\\n\"coma\" condition.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment. Preventive.--The patient should avoid taking cold in this\\r\\ndisease. Light and easily digested diet is necessary. The bowels must be\\r\\nkept regular. Alcohol of any kind should not be used. The bladder should\\r\\nbe emptied at regular intervals. Some patients keep a catheter and \"draw\"\\r\\ntheir own urine. Unless the patient takes great care, the bladder and\\r\\nurethra will be irritated and perhaps infected through neglect of\\r\\ncleanliness. Medicines are not very useful in severe cases. Operation is\\r\\nthe only reliable cure especially when some urine is always retained.\\r\\n\\r\\nURINARY PASSAGE. Mother\\'s Remedy.--1. Dandelion Root Will Clean.--\"A\\r\\ndecoction made of the sliced root of dandelion in white wine is very\\r\\neffectual for cleansing and healing inward ulcers in the urinary passage.\\r\\nIf the fresh root cannot be obtained, buy extract of dandelion and give\\r\\ntwo teaspoonfuls in water once in two or three hours as the case requires.\\r\\nIt also acts on the liver, gall and spleen.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[KIDNEY AND BLADDER 165]\\r\\n\\r\\nDROPSY.--Dropsy should be regarded as a symptom, which may arise from many\\r\\ncauses, such as heart disease, lung disease or kidney disease, or it may\\r\\ndepend upon obstruction to the normal flow of blood and lymph through the\\r\\nvessels and tissues.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom Heart Disease.--In heart disease dropsy is due to a weak heart. The\\r\\nheart is unable to supply the arteries with enough blood to maintain the\\r\\nnormal pressure, or to damming up of blood in the venous system as the\\r\\nresult of imperfect emptying of the heart cavities. In kidney trouble the\\r\\ndropsy depends more on the lack of proper nourishing processes in the\\r\\ncapillary walls and upon changes in the blood and blood pressure. If the\\r\\nkidneys are diseased, they may not be able to eliminate the proper amount\\r\\nof liquids which accumulate and finally escape into the tissues. Liver\\r\\ntroubles cause dropsy by producing pressure upon the large blood-vessels\\r\\ngoing to the liver, and consequently the fluid is generally confined to\\r\\nthe lower limbs and abdomen.\\r\\n\\r\\nMOTHERS\\' REMEDIES. Dropsy, 1. Juniper Berries Fresh or Dry for.--\"The\\r\\nberries of the juniper tree are regarded as excellent home remedies in\\r\\ndropsy. They may be eaten fresh or dry, or make a decoction and drink. Two\\r\\nteaspoonfuls of the berries two or three times a day is considered a dose.\\r\\nIt is well to bruise them thoroughly by breaking the seeds with a hammer\\r\\nbefore taking.\" The decoction is more effective. This helps the dropsy by\\r\\nacting on the kidneys.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Dropsy, Wild Milkweed for.--\"Steep the root of the wild milkweek and\\r\\ndrink the tea in doses of a wineglass three times a day. This is a sure\\r\\ncure if taken in early stages.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Dropsy, White Bay Buds for.--\"White bay buds steeped in water.\" The\\r\\nwhite bay buds can be secured at any drug store, and are easily prepared.\\r\\nMake a tea of these the same as you would make green tea for the table,\\r\\nonly stronger. Take several times a day. This is an excellent remedy.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Dropsy, Canada Thistle for.--\"Steep dwarf elder root, or Canada thistle\\r\\nroot, and drink the tea.\" This is an old tried remedy that our\\r\\ngrandmothers used to use, and can be depended upon. We all know that in\\r\\nolden times mothers had to use these herb remedies, as doctors could not\\r\\nbe secured as easily as they can in these days.\\r\\n\\r\\n5. Dropsy, Very Effective Remedy for.--\"Make a decoction of fresh\\r\\ndandelion root slices, one ounce to one pint of water boiled down to\\r\\none-half pint, strain, adding two drams of cream of tartar.

A disease may be infectious but not contagious.\\r\\nMalaria is an instance. Infection means an ability to enter the body from\\r\\nany source, wind, water, food or other persons and produce a\\r\\ncharacteristic disease. The agency doing this is known as a germ.\\r\\nContagion is properly a poisoning of one individual from contact with a\\r\\ndiseased individual in some way known or unknown. It may be conveyed\\r\\nindirectly through clothes, etc., or other person; but always comes from\\r\\nsome person sick with the same disease. Diseases may be both infectious\\r\\nand contagious. Nearly all the epidemic diseases of infancy are both\\r\\ninfectious and contagious and accompanied by fever. In nursing children,\\r\\nsuffering from infectious diseases the mother or nurse should avoid their\\r\\nbreath and handle them as little as possible. All secretion from bowels\\r\\nand kidneys should fall in a vessel containing a disinfecting solution of\\r\\nCopperas, bichloride of mercury, etc., and should be emptied into the\\r\\nsewer or buried. Following are the solutions as made. Copperas:--Put a\\r\\nlump as big as a walnut in the chamber with one-half pint of water, to\\r\\nreceive feces, urine, sputum and vomited matter from infectious and\\r\\ncontagious patients.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Solution of chlorinated soda, four fluid ounces; water ten ounces,\\r\\nuseful for hands and dishes, not silverware. Dissolve eight corrosive\\r\\nsublimate tablets, also called bichloride, in a gallon of water. This is\\r\\nused to disinfect floors, woodwork, rubber, and leather, but not metal\\r\\nparts. Great care must be taken to have the hands washed after handling\\r\\nsuch a patient, so as not to infect the food, eyes, mouth, or any small\\r\\nskin sores.\\r\\n\\r\\n[INFECTIOUS DISEASES 167]\\r\\n\\r\\nDiet in Infectious Diseases.--Foods that can be used: Milk, milk-water,\\r\\nmilk and lime-water, Mellin\\'s food, malted milk, imperial granum, albumin\\r\\nwater, rice water, oatmeal water, barley water, egg (white part), and\\r\\nbarley water, arrowroot water, whey, whey and cream mixture, cream and\\r\\nrice mixture, beef tea, beef extract, mutton broth, beef juice. Chewing\\r\\nbroiled steak and only swallowing the juice, dry toast and soft boiled\\r\\neggs, milk toast, dried beef broth, soups, rice, cornstarch, tapioca, etc.\\r\\nThe diet must not consist of solid food in any severe case of fever. Small\\r\\nquantities of cold drinks can be given, frequently repeated if there is no\\r\\nvomiting. Frequent washing with tepid water or cool water lessens the\\r\\nfever and produces sleep. The bowels should be kept open at least once a\\r\\nday, and castor oil or salts usually can be given.

Definition.--Scarlet fever is an acute infectious disease,\\r\\nwith a characteristic eruption.\\r\\n\\r\\nModes of Conveying.--The nearer a person is to a patient the more likely\\r\\none is to take or convey the disease. Clothing, bedding, etc., may retain\\r\\nthe poison for months. Scales from the skin of a patient, dried\\r\\nsecretions, the urine if inflammation of the kidneys (nephritis) exists,\\r\\nthe discharges (feces) from the bowels, are all means of infection. The\\r\\nlonger a person remains near the patient the more likely he is to convey\\r\\nthe disease. Foods handled by those sick of the disease, or by those who\\r\\nmay have been near patients may convey the disease. This is especially\\r\\ntrue of milk. Epidemics of scarlet fever have been started by dairy-men\\r\\nwho had scarlet fever in their family. I once attended a family where the\\r\\nonly known cause for it in that family was a long-haired dog of a neighbor\\r\\nwho had scarlet fever in the family. The dog was in the room with the sick\\r\\nones, and visited the neighbor\\'s family and played with the children who\\r\\nafterwards came down with the fever. Discharges from the ear, caused by\\r\\nscarlet fever, are said to be capable of giving it.\\r\\n\\r\\n[168 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nRemains in the Room, how long?--It may remain for months in a room, and\\r\\nextend over two years as recorded by Murchison. We do not yet know how the\\r\\npoison obtains entrance to the body. Hence, the need for thorough\\r\\ndisinfection.\\r\\n\\r\\nAge, Occurrence, Susceptibility.--All children exposed to the disease do\\r\\nnot contract the disease. It is less contagious than measles. A person who\\r\\nis exposed once, and does not take it, may take it at a future exposure.\\r\\nIt occurs at any age and in all countries. It occurs oftener in autumn\\r\\n(September) and winter (February). Isolated cases occur, and then it is\\r\\ncalled sporadic. This disease attacks nursing children less frequently\\r\\nthan older children. It is not often seen during the first year of life.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow Often?--As a rule, it attacks a person only once; yet there are\\r\\nrecorded cases of well observed second and third attacks, but fortunately\\r\\nthese are very rare. I once attended a family where they had it and\\r\\nclaimed to have had it before, but very lightly.\\r\\n\\r\\nIncubation.--The vast majority of cases develop within three to five days\\r\\nafter exposure. If eleven days elapse without the appearance of symptoms\\r\\nwe may reasonably expect that the danger is past, at least in the great\\r\\nmajority of cases exposed.\\r\\n\\r\\nContagiousness.--There is danger of catching the disease during the stages\\r\\nof incubation, eruption and scaling. It is most contagious in the last two\\r\\nstages.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnset.--Sometimes the onset is sudden; there may be a convulsion, preceded\\r\\nby a sharp rise in the temperature. An examination in such cases may\\r\\nreveal a marked sore throat or a membranous deposit on the tonsils\\r\\npreceding the eruption, and nothing more. A chill followed by fever and\\r\\nvomiting ushers in a large number of cases. These may be mild or severe.\\r\\nThe severity of these symptoms usually indicates the gravity of the\\r\\nattack.\\r\\n\\r\\nRash.--The rash or eruption appears from twelve to thirty-six hours after\\r\\nthe onset, usually on the second day, and looks like a very severe heat\\r\\nrash, but is finer and thicker. It consists of a very finely pointed\\r\\nrose-colored rash. In mild cases it is hardly noticeable. Usually it first\\r\\nappears on the upper part of the chest around the collar bones, spreads\\r\\nover the chest and around upon the back. Also it is now seen on the neck,\\r\\nbeneath the jaw, behind the ears and on the temples, thence spreads over\\r\\nthe body. There is a paleness about the mouth and wings of the nose, while\\r\\nthe cheeks are flushed with a flame-like redness. There is much itching if\\r\\nthe rash is severe. It attains the full development at the end of two or\\r\\nthree days, and then gradually declines. In some cases the rash is seen\\r\\nonly twenty-four hours.\\r\\n\\r\\nFever.--The fever rises rapidly in the first few hours to 104 or 105-8/10\\r\\ndegrees. It remains high except in the morning, until the eruption reaches\\r\\nits full development and falls with the fading eruption, and in\\r\\nuncomplicated and typical cases, within six days becomes normal.\\r\\n\\r\\n[INFECTIOUS DISEASES 169]\\r\\n\\r\\nSore Throat.--This we find on the pillars of the fauces, uvula, tonsils,\\r\\nand pharynx, reddened and inflamed. Sometimes it is very severe, and a\\r\\nmembrane comes on one or both tonsils and pillars of the fauces. There is,\\r\\ngenerally a severe sore throat, and this makes swallowing difficult.\\r\\n\\r\\nTongue.--The tongue is covered with a coating at the onset, and may\\r\\npresent a slightly reddened appearance at the borders and tip. The\\r\\npapillae are prominent and covered and look like a strawberry sometimes,\\r\\nor like the tongue of a cat. In fatal poisonous cases it becomes dry and\\r\\ncracked.\\r\\n\\r\\nScaling.--As the disease subsides the outer layer of the skin dries and\\r\\npeels off. The extent of this depends upon the severity of the attack. In\\r\\nsome cases the scaling is hardly perceptible, and sometimes it appears\\r\\nonly on certain parts, such as on the toes and inner parts of the thighs.\\r\\nThere is always some scaling. This is called \"desquamation.\" Generally\\r\\nspeaking, scaling begins where the eruption first appeared on the upper\\r\\npart of the chest and neck. The scales may be fine and branny or as is\\r\\nmost common, the skin peels in large particles. Some scaling is always\\r\\npresent. The length of the scaling time is variable. It usually lasts from\\r\\nthree to four weeks, but often longer. This stage is considered by many as\\r\\nthe most contagious, as the fine scales fly in the air.\\r\\n\\r\\nComplications. Nose.--The nose is affected at the same time if the \"sore\\r\\nthroat\" is very severe. A membrane may also form in the nose.\\r\\n\\r\\nEar.--This may be affected in as high as one-fifth of the cases and needs\\r\\ncareful watching and attention. Both ears may be diseased and deafness\\r\\nfrequently results from it. Ten per cent of those who suffer from\\r\\n\"deaf-mutism\" can trace their affliction to scarlet fever. The ears\\r\\nusually become afflicted in the third week. The fever rises and there is\\r\\npain in the ears or ear. The onset may not appear alarming and not be\\r\\nsuspected until the discharge makes its appearance This is unfortunate;\\r\\nthese complications are serious, as meningitis and abscess of the brain\\r\\nmay result. The ear trouble (otitis) usually occurs during the scaling.\\r\\nThe patient may be up and around. There is a rise of the temperature to\\r\\n103 or 104 degrees, the patient begins to vomit food and has a headache.\\r\\nAt night the child starts from its crib and cries as if in pain. They do\\r\\nnot always locate the pain in the ear. The face and hands may twitch. The\\r\\nfever may fall to normal and rise sharply again. Such symptoms should call\\r\\nfor a thorough examination.\\r\\n\\r\\nEye.--Inflammation of the (conjunctiva) red membrane of the eyes, often\\r\\noccurs.\\r\\n\\r\\n[170 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nKidneys.--There may be a mild form of inflammation in the earlier stages.\\r\\nThe severe form comes, if at all, usually in the third week. It occurs in\\r\\nfive to seven per cent of the cases. It may occur in the mildest case, as\\r\\nsuch cases are not so closely watched. The first symptom is a slight\\r\\nbloating of the eyes and face and spreads over the whole body. Sometimes\\r\\nthe swelling is very slight; at other times it is extreme. The urine\\r\\ndiminishes early and sometimes is wholly suppressed. It may be light\\r\\ncolored, smoky or straw colored. This trouble usually runs for weeks. The\\r\\npatient may get uremia and result fatally.\\r\\n\\r\\nHeart.--This also may be affected as the valves may become diseased.\\r\\n\\r\\nJoints.--Rheumatism also may occur, and other complications.\\r\\n\\r\\nChorea.--Follows scarlet fever also, especially in girls from twelve to\\r\\nfifteen years.\\r\\n\\r\\nDiagnosis.--In most cases it is easy to distinguish from other diseases.\\r\\nDermatitis, inflammation of the skin (\"Itis\" always means inflammation).\\r\\nIn dermatitis the throat symptoms and strawberry tongue are absent.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom Measles.--By the rapid onset, absence of cold symptoms of the nose,\\r\\neyes, and bronchial tubes, blotchy eruptions that occur in measles. There\\r\\nis no strawberry tongue in measles and no coughing at beginning.\\r\\n\\r\\nRecovery.--The prognosis is favorable in uncomplicated cases. It also\\r\\ndepends upon the character of the epidemic type of the disease. In England\\r\\nit varies from thirteen to fourteen per cent. In this country it is\\r\\nsometimes as low as two to four per cent. The kidney trouble is always\\r\\nfeared for it may result in uremia and death, or the acute may be followed\\r\\nby chronic nephritis or Bright\\'s disease, which will ultimately prove\\r\\nfatal.\\r\\n\\r\\nSanitary Care of Room and Patient.--If you are exposed to this disease\\r\\nwhat can you do? If a child, it must be put in a room by itself. If\\r\\nseveral children have been exposed they should be put in separate rooms.\\r\\nThese rooms should have no carpet, curtains, rugs, etc., or any\\r\\nunnecessary furniture, for everything must be disinfected afterward, and\\r\\nsometimes destroyed. The clothes worn just before the sickness should be\\r\\nsterilized in steam or boiled and then aired in the sun. Anyone suffering\\r\\nfrom sore throat who has been about the patient should not be allowed to\\r\\nbe near the healthy. All the children must be kept from school. It is well\\r\\nfor them to spray their throats with a simple cleansing solution morning\\r\\nand night, with a full teaspoonful of boric acid to a glass full of warm\\r\\nwater; or you can use common salt, but not strong enough to irritate the\\r\\nthroat, about one teaspoonful to a glass of water. If you have listerine\\r\\nor glyco-thymoline or any such disinfectant use them, one teaspoonful to\\r\\nsixteen spoonfuls of water. Hot water itself is a very good gargle, very\\r\\nhealing and cleansing. Anyone who enters the sick room and comes out again\\r\\nshould wear a sheet all over him. On coming out, he or she should leave\\r\\nthis sheet outside the window of another room. If the person has a beard\\r\\nhe should wash his face with a 1 to 2000 solution of corrosive sublimate,\\r\\nand the hands also, before leaving the sick room. The one who waits upon\\r\\nthe sick one should remain there, but everyone can not do so. They must\\r\\nstay away from the healthy if possible.\\r\\n\\r\\n[INFECTIOUS DISEASES 171]\\r\\n\\r\\nCity and State Supervision.--If you live in the city your physician should\\r\\nnotify the health board who will probably send someone to instruct you\\r\\nregarding cautions and some cities have private rules, laws, etc., for\\r\\nthem to follow while under quarantine. A copy is usually furnished also to\\r\\nyour close neighbors. Also some of the state departments of health have\\r\\nmade up pamphlets which are circulated free on request dealing with the\\r\\nsanitary science of infectious and contagious diseases. Some colleges use\\r\\nthese same pamphlets in their study of sanitary science. Much valuable\\r\\ninformation is contained in them. Comparatively few people learn of these\\r\\npamphlets. For the benefit of those who have not read or seen them we\\r\\nquote from their scarlet fever subjects as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\nHOW TO AVOID AND PREVENT SCARLET FEVER.\\r\\n\\r\\nDo not let a child go near a case of scarlet fever. This is especially\\r\\nimportant to be observed.\\r\\n\\r\\nChildren are in much greater danger of death from scarlet fever than are\\r\\nadults; but adult persons often get and spread the disease, and sometimes\\r\\ndie from it. Mild cases in adults may cause fatal cases among children.\\r\\nUnless your services are needed keep away from the disease yourself. If\\r\\nyou do visit a case, bathe yourself and change and disinfect your clothing\\r\\nand hair, beard, if any, and hands before you go where there is a child.\\r\\nDo not permit any person or thing or a dog or cat, or other animal to come\\r\\nfrom a case of scarlet fever to a child. No cat or dog should be permitted\\r\\nto enter the sick room.\\r\\n\\r\\nDo not permit a child to wear or handle clothing worn by a person during\\r\\nsickness or convalescence from scarlet fever.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeware of any person who has sore throat. Do not kiss or come near to such\\r\\na person. Do not drink from the same cup, blow the same whistle, or put\\r\\nhis pen or pencil in your mouth. Whenever a child has sore throat and\\r\\nfever, and especially when this is accompanied by a rash on the body, the\\r\\nchild and attendant should immediately be isolated until the physician has\\r\\nseen it and determined whether it has scarlet fever. Strict quarantine\\r\\nshould be established and maintained throughout the course of the disease.\\r\\nExposed persons should be isolated until such time has elapsed as may\\r\\nprove that they are not infected. The period of incubation, that is the\\r\\ninterval of time between exposure to the contagion of scarlet fever and\\r\\nthe first sign of the disease in the person so exposed, varies. In many\\r\\ncases it appears in seven days, in some cases in fourteen days, and in\\r\\nsome cases twenty-one days; the average period is about nine days.\\r\\nQuarantine of persons exposed should not be raised under four weeks.\\r\\n\\r\\n[172 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nChildren believed to be uninfected may be sent away from the house in\\r\\nwhich there is scarlet fever to families in which there are no persons\\r\\nliable to the disease, or to previously disinfected convalescent wards in\\r\\nhospitals; but in either case they should be isolated from the public\\r\\nuntil the expiration of the period of incubation. This time may vary, but\\r\\nfor full protection to the public isolation should be observed for four\\r\\nweeks.\\r\\n\\r\\nPersons who are attending upon children or other persons suffering from\\r\\nscarlet fever, and also the members of the patient\\'s family, should not\\r\\nmingle with other people nor permit the entrance of children into their\\r\\nhouse.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSANITARY CARE OF INFECTED AND SICK PERSONS AND ROOMS.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll persons known to be sick with this disease (even those but mildly\\r\\nsick) should be promptly and thoroughly isolated from the public and\\r\\nfamily. In ordering the isolation of infected persons, the health officer\\r\\nmeans that their communication with well persons and the movement of any\\r\\narticle from the infected room or premises shall be absolutely cut off.\\r\\n\\r\\nExcept it be disinfected, no letter or paper should be sent through the\\r\\nmail from an infected place. That this is of more importance than in the\\r\\ncase of smallpox is indicated by the fact of the much greater number of\\r\\ncases of sickness and of deaths from scarlet fever,--a disease for which\\r\\nno such preventive as vaccination is yet known.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe room in which one sick with this disease is to be placed should\\r\\npreviously be cleared of all needless clothing, drapery and other\\r\\nmaterials likely to harbor the germs of the disease; and except after\\r\\nthorough disinfection nothing already exposed to the contagion of the\\r\\ndisease should be moved from the room. The sick room should have only such\\r\\narticles as are indispensable to the well-being of the patient, and should\\r\\nhave no carpet, or only pieces which can afterwards be destroyed.\\r\\nProvision should be made for the introduction of a liberal supply of fresh\\r\\nair and the continual change of the air in the room without sensible\\r\\ncurrents or drafts.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoiled clothing, towels, bed linen, etc., on removal from the patient\\r\\nshould not be carried about while dry; but should be placed in a pail or\\r\\ntub covered with a five per cent solution of carbolic acid, six and\\r\\nthree-fourths ounces of carbolic acid to one gallon water. Soiled clothing\\r\\nshould in all cases be disinfected before sending away to the laundry,\\r\\neither by boiling for at least half an hour or by soaking in the five per\\r\\ncent solution of carbolic acid.\\r\\n\\r\\n[INFECTIOUS DISEASES 173]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe discharges from the throat, nose, mouth, and from the kidneys and\\r\\nbowels of the patient should be received into vessels containing an equal\\r\\nvolume of a five per cent solution of carbolic acid, and in cities where\\r\\nsewers are used, thrown into the water closet; elsewhere the same should\\r\\nbe buried at least one hundred feet distant from any well, and should not\\r\\nby any means be thrown into a running stream, nor into a cesspool or\\r\\nprivy, except after having been thoroughly disinfected. Discharges from\\r\\nthe bladder and bowels may be received on old cloths, which should be\\r\\nimmediately burned. All vessels should be kept scrupulously clean and\\r\\ndisinfected. Discharges from the nose, ears, etc., may be received on soft\\r\\nrags or pieces of cloth and which should be immediately burned.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll cups, glasses, spoons, etc., used in the sick room, should at once on\\r\\nremoval from the room, be washed in the five per cent solution of carbolic\\r\\nacid and afterwards in hot water, before being used by any other person.\\r\\n\\r\\nFood and drink that have been in the sick room should be disinfected and\\r\\nburied. It should not be put in the swill barrel.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerfect cleanliness of nurses and attendants should be enjoined and\\r\\nsecured. As the hands of the nurses of necessity become frequently\\r\\ncontaminated by the contagion of the disease, a good supply of towels and\\r\\nbasins, one containing a two per cent solution of carbolic acid (two and\\r\\nthree-fifths ounces of carbolic acid to a gallon of water) and another for\\r\\nplain soap and water should always be at hand and freely used.\\r\\n\\r\\nPersons recovering from scarlet fever, so long as any scaling or peeling\\r\\nof the skin, soreness of the eyes or air passages or symptoms of dropsy\\r\\nremain, should be considered dangerous, and, therefore, should not attend\\r\\nschool, church or any public assembly or use any public conveyance. In a\\r\\nhouse infected with scarlet fever, a temporary disinfection after apparent\\r\\nrecovery may be made, so as to release from isolation the members of the\\r\\nhousehold who have not had the disease.\\r\\n\\r\\nDiet and Nursing.--Food should be given every two to four hours. Only\\r\\nwater can be given as long as there is nausea and vomiting, and sometimes\\r\\nnot even that. After they have stopped you can give milk and water and\\r\\nthen milk. You should give it to a child every two to three hours, about\\r\\none-fourth of a glass full and warm if possible. A child can take at least\\r\\none quart in twenty-four hours. Watch the stomach and bowels for bad\\r\\nsymptoms; if necessary you can put in one teaspoonful of lime water after\\r\\nthe milk has been heated. If the child will not take milk, use one of the\\r\\nprepared foods. Mellins\\' malted milk, Borden\\'s malted milk, peptonized\\r\\nmilk, Imperial Granum, and follow the directions on the bottle. The\\r\\ndifferent food waters mentioned above are to use when milk and other food\\r\\npreparations cannot be given. Albumen (white of an egg and water, not\\r\\nwhipped) can be given and always cold. Cold milk also tastes better.\\r\\n\\r\\n[174 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the Sickness, etc.--The linen, bedding, etc., of the patient should\\r\\nbe put into a one to five-thousand solution of corrosive sublimate (you\\r\\ncan buy that strength tablet) before being boiled, dried and aired in the\\r\\nsun. The sick room must be kept well ventilated, but no drafts should be\\r\\nallowed to go over the patient. The temperature is better at 68 degrees F.\\r\\nThe patient should be kept in bed during all the feverish stage and during\\r\\nthe scaling stage also.\\r\\n\\r\\nCare must be taken lest the patient take cold. During this time there is a\\r\\ngreat danger of ear and kidney trouble. It would be safer to keep the\\r\\npatient in bed until the peeling is done. Children are naturally lively,\\r\\nrisky, and a little careless. To keep the scales from flying you can\\r\\ngrease the patient with cold cream, vaselin, lard, etc. This will also\\r\\nhelp to ease the itching. The peeling is aided by bathing the patient\\r\\nevery day with warm, soapy water.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpecial Treatment.--In ordinary cases little treatment is needed except to\\r\\nkeep the throat and nose free from excessive secretions. The urine should\\r\\nbe examined daily, and the bowels should move once or twice a day. Cold\\r\\nwater should be given frequently after the nausea has passed away. Milk is\\r\\nthe usual food, but must not be given during the vomiting stage. Equal\\r\\nparts of milk and water can be given after the vomiting stage, if the\\r\\npatient will not take pure milk.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the vomiting stage very little water even can be given. The\\r\\ngreatest danger in scarlet fever comes from the throat complications and\\r\\nthe high fever.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the fever is high the patient suffers from delirium. A temperature of\\r\\n105 is dangerous and such patients must be bathed well in water,\\r\\ncommencing at 90 degrees and rubbed well all over while in the water,\\r\\nallowing the temperature of the bath to fall to 85 or 80 degrees while so\\r\\ndoing; bath to last five to fifteen minutes. Bathe the head with water, at\\r\\nthe temperature of 50 degrees, all the time the temperature is at 103\\r\\ndegrees or higher. Always use the thermometer to determine the temperature\\r\\nof the water. Weakly children often do not stand the bath well, so you\\r\\nmust exercise discretion in giving it often. The temperature must be kept\\r\\ndown to 102 to 103-1/2, and baths must be used often to do so. Where baths\\r\\ncannot be used, frequent washing with water at 60 to 70 degrees must be\\r\\nadopted without drying the child afterwards. A mother should always\\r\\nremember that a feverish, restless child needs a bath or a good washing\\r\\nwith cool soap and water. If the bowels and kidneys do not act freely\\r\\nenough give the following:\\r\\n\\r\\n    Epsom Salts        2 ounces\\r\\n    Cream of Tartar    2 ounces\\r\\n\\r\\nMix and give one-half teaspoonful in water every three hours until the\\r\\nbowels move freely.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is the dose for a child one year old.\\r\\n\\r\\n[INFECTIOUS DISEASES  175]\\r\\n\\r\\nDropsy in Scarlet Fever.--In this case you must have a doctor. A simple\\r\\nway to make a dropsy patient sweat is to place the patient upon a cane\\r\\nseated chair, pin a blanket around the neck, covering the whole body.\\r\\nUnder the chair place a wooden pail half full of cool water and into this\\r\\nput a brick baked as hot as possible; or you can introduce steam under the\\r\\nblanket while the patient is sitting on a chair, or lying in bed, taking\\r\\ncare not to scald the patient. This will cause sweating, and relieve the\\r\\ndropsy and also congested kidneys.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow Soon May a Scarlet Fever Patient Associate with the Healthy?--It is\\r\\nbest to wait a few weeks after scaling ends. Give the patient a bath in a\\r\\none to 10,000 corrosive sublimate solution first.\\r\\n\\r\\nCaution.--An ordinary case of scarlet fever does not need much medicine.\\r\\nNursing and care are essential. Even the slightest case should be watched.\\r\\nThere is always danger of the eyes, ears and kidneys becoming affected. If\\r\\nthe child complains of pain in the head the ear must be examined. If the\\r\\nurine passed is small in quantity, or if there are any signs of dropsy,\\r\\ntreatment must be given at once. You have heard very much lately about the\\r\\nsting of the honey bee for rheumatism. I often use a preparation of this\\r\\nfor the kidney troubles in scarlet fever. The name is Apis Mel. I use the\\r\\nsecond or third homeopathic attenuation in tablet form and give one to two\\r\\nabout every two hours. I have found this effective in such cases where the\\r\\nurine is small in quantity, and there is some dropsy. The lightest cases\\r\\ncan have dropsy, especially if special care is not taken when scaling goes\\r\\non.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was once attending three children for scarlet fever. The one that had it\\r\\nin a mild form became affected with dropsy. For this I steamed her. In her\\r\\ncase I placed her in a cane-seated chair, pinned a blanket tightly around\\r\\nher so as to thoroughly cover her, put a pail of cool water under her\\r\\nchair and dropped into the pail a hot baked brick. The hot brick caused\\r\\nsteam to rise from the water and enveloped the child, producing sweating.\\r\\nThis was done frequently, and the child considered it a joke, but it\\r\\nrelieved her of the bloat. It was in the country and these crude means\\r\\nproduced the desired result. By attaching a rubber tube to a steaming\\r\\nkettle and introducing the steam under the covering the same result can be\\r\\nproduced. Sometimes you may not have all things you wish, then you must\\r\\nmake use of what is handy. You would be surprised perhaps to know how much\\r\\ncan be done to relieve sickness by what can be found in every house. (For\\r\\ndisinfectants see chapter on nursing.)\\r\\n\\r\\n[176 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMEASLES.--Measles is an acute infectious disease, distinguished by a\\r\\ncharacteristic eruption on the mucous membranes and skin. It is very\\r\\ncontagious and spreads through the atmosphere. Almost everyone is\\r\\nsusceptible to measles and suffers at least one attack. The disease is not\\r\\nfrequent during the first year of life. It prevails in all countries.\\r\\n\\r\\nIncubation.--This varies from thirteen to fifteen days. In calculating\\r\\nthis period we include the time from exposure to the appearance of the\\r\\neruption. One attack generally protects the person from another attack.\\r\\nThe period of the greatest danger of taking it extends through the period\\r\\nof the eruption. It diminishes as the eruption fades. From this we learn\\r\\nthat the infection in measles takes place generally in the incubation\\r\\nstage.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms and Description of Ordinary Type.--The first symptoms may be only\\r\\na headache or a slight disturbance of the stomach. There may be some fever\\r\\nin the evening. There is now a redness and watery condition of the eyes,\\r\\nand general feeling of weariness. The cold symptoms (coryza) are not yet\\r\\nmarked, but if we look in the mouth we may see a few spots on the mucous\\r\\nmembrane of the cheek. Then follow the sneezing, running at the nose, sore\\r\\nand red eyes; running water, sensitiveness to the light, cough and fever.\\r\\nThe eruption now appears, and is first noticed on the side of the head and\\r\\nthe wings of the nose, as a red spotted eruption, which soon looks like a\\r\\npimple, and then \"blotchy.\" Older people feel quite sick. The aching all\\r\\nover, and headache are sometimes almost unbearable, especially when there\\r\\nis much coughing. The face, eyes and scalp are soon covered by the red\\r\\nrose irregularly shaped pimples, which next appear rapidly on the back of\\r\\nthe hands, fore-arms, front of the trunk, on the back and lower\\r\\nextremities. This order is not always maintained. Sometimes it first\\r\\nappears on the back.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe eruptive stage generally lasts three or four days, during which time\\r\\nthe symptoms are all aggravated, especially by any strong light, on\\r\\naccount of the sore eyes for the measles are also in them. We have active\\r\\ncold symptoms like sneezing, running at the nose, snorting, snuffling,\\r\\nhawking. The cough is terribly severe, annoying, making the lungs and\\r\\nstomach very sore. The head feels as if it would split. The patient holds\\r\\nhis chest and \"stomach\" while coughing. Symptoms of acute bronchitis\\r\\ndevelop. Sometimes there is much diarrhea. Pneumonia often develops\\r\\nthrough carelessness. The fever reaches its height when the eruption is\\r\\nfully developed. The eruption fades after it has been out for three or\\r\\nfour days, and then all the symptoms decrease, the fever lessens and\\r\\nbecomes normal by gradual morning remissions. Scaling begins when the\\r\\npinkish hue of the rash has disappeared and continues until the last\\r\\nvestige of reddish spots has disappeared. As a rule it is completed in two\\r\\nto four weeks after the first eruption has appeared. Sometimes the scaling\\r\\nis difficult to see, but it is never absent in measles: It is best seen on\\r\\nthe front part of the chest, shoulders, and the inner surface of the\\r\\nthighs. The temperature may reach 104 to 105-8/10 without complications.\\r\\nThis description gives a picture of a typical case. The eruption that\\r\\nappears in the mucous membrane of the mouth appears three to four days\\r\\nbefore the skin rash. It is accompanied by redness of the pharynx and of\\r\\nthe front and back pillars of the fauces. The soft palate is studded with\\r\\nirregular shaped, rose colored spots or streaks and the hard palate\\r\\npresents small whitish vesicles. They are also found on the colored mucous\\r\\nmembrane of the cheeks and on that opposite the gums of the upper and\\r\\nlower teeth. The rash of measles is a characteristic eruption of rose\\r\\ncolored or purple colored papules (pimples). As a rule the whole face is\\r\\ncovered with the eruption and is swollen. Diphtheria may complicate\\r\\nmeasles. Bronchitis and brancho-pneumonia also may occur, especially if\\r\\nthe patient is careless and takes cold. Diarrhea is frequently present.\\r\\n\\r\\n[INFECTIOUS DISEASES 177]\\r\\n\\r\\nEyes.--Following severe cases fear of light, spasm of the orbicularis\\r\\nmuscle, inflammation of the lachrymal duct, conjunctivitis, ulceration of\\r\\nthe cornea and amaurosis (general blindness) may result. Hence the\\r\\nnecessity of careful attention to the eyes. Never read anything during the\\r\\nattack of the measles. The ear may also become afflicted. There are other\\r\\ncomplications, but these mentioned are the important ones.\\r\\n\\r\\nMortality in Measles.--The mortality in childhood and infancy is about\\r\\neight per cent. Mortality is greatest for number of cases during the first\\r\\nyear. Six per cent between fifth and eighth years.\\r\\n\\r\\nDiagnosis.--Presents few difficulties in a typical case. The mode of onset\\r\\nis cold symptoms of the nose and eye, cough; appearance of the mouth,\\r\\nthroat and the blotchy eruptions are very characteristic.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment. Prevention.--As soon as you know it to be the measles, separate\\r\\nthe case and put the patient in a well-aired room where you can have air\\r\\nwithout a draft and where the room can be made and kept dark. Those\\r\\npersons who must go in the room should put over them a linen robe, and\\r\\nhang it outside of the sick room. It should thoroughly cover them. When\\r\\nnot in use hang it in the open air. An attendant who wears a beard should\\r\\ndisinfect his beard, face, head and hands before mingling with the well.\\r\\n\\r\\nMOTHERS\\' REMEDIES.--1. Measles, Lemon Remedy from a Canadian\\r\\nMother.--\"Give child all cold lemonade it can drink and keep in warm room.\\r\\nThis acts just as well as if the drinks are hot. We tried both on our\\r\\nchildren and cured both ways.\" Don\\'t give so much of the cold as to chill.\\r\\nThe cold drink makes child sweat, just as hot does. Also helps to carry\\r\\noff impurities by flushing bowels, just as clear water would.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Measles, Elder Blossom Tea to Drive Out.--\"Elder blossom tea is good\\r\\nfor a cold or fever. Gather the blossoms, and make a tea. Pleasant to\\r\\ntake. Sweeten if desired. This is also good to drive out the measles.\"\\r\\nThis remedy should be taken warm and is especially good to bring out the\\r\\nrash in children. Take a teaspoonful every hour.\\r\\n\\r\\n[178 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral Treatment.--An ordinary case of measles does not need much\\r\\ntreatment. If the patient has a high fever and is very hot and restless,\\r\\nbathe with tepid or cool water every two or three hours, till the patient\\r\\nbecomes quite restful. Sometimes they have too much covering and that\\r\\nmakes them hot and restless. Remove a little at a time. Bathing will not\\r\\nhurt the rash, for it can be done under the clothes and without any danger\\r\\nto the patient.\\r\\n\\r\\nCold Drinks.--These are refreshing and beneficial, if not given too\\r\\nfreely. One-third of a glass of water is enough at one time, but it can be\\r\\ngiven often, if it does not chill the patient. After the feverish days\\r\\nhave passed, diluted milk or plain milk can be given in greater amount.\\r\\n\\r\\nCough in Measles.--It is likely to be severe, straining and barking and\\r\\nhard to relieve. If it is too severe you can give, for a child one year\\r\\nold:\\r\\n\\r\\n    Acetanelid       1/2 dram\\r\\n    Dover\\'s Powder   1/2 dram\\r\\n\\r\\nMix and make into thirty powders.\\r\\n\\r\\nGive one-half powder every two hours when awake or restless.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. For a child two years old:\\r\\n\\r\\n    Paregoric       2 to 5 drops\\r\\n    Syrup Ipecac    3 drops\\r\\n\\r\\nMix.\\r\\n\\r\\nGive every three hours, according to age, one to three hours for a child\\r\\ntwo years old.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. For Irritation of the Skin.--Sponge once a day with water at 100\\r\\ndegrees F. containing a little alcohol or a pinch of sodium bicarbonate or\\r\\nsoda.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. For Scaling.--Use ointment of benzoinated lard, combined with five per\\r\\ncent of boric acid.\\r\\n\\r\\nDiet.--The food should be light; milk, broths, and when the fever is gone\\r\\nchicken and soft boiled eggs, jelly, toasted bread, crackers, cereals,\\r\\nwith cocoa for drink. Orange juice or lemon juice may be given in\\r\\nmoderation. Milk, one pint per day for every fifty pounds in weight of the\\r\\npatient, during a fever sickness, is a safe and liberal allowance. Smaller\\r\\nchildren in proportion. Mothers will be apt to give too much and it may\\r\\nthen prevent rest and steep. When the fever subsides you can give more\\r\\nmilk and some of the above foods. Water, as before stated, can be given\\r\\nfor the thirst quite frequently.\\r\\n\\r\\n[INFECTIOUS DISEASES 179]\\r\\n\\r\\nTeas.--The laity gives lots of these to bring out the rash. It seems to me\\r\\nbefore the rash is out the patient is feverish and chilly and the skin is\\r\\ndry, and a small amount of tea given every hour or two might do good\\r\\nunless the patient is made warmer. There are many varieties given. Elder\\r\\nblossom seems to have the call. For some time after the patient is well he\\r\\nmay be bothered with a cough; it better be looked after if it continues,\\r\\nfor there might be bronchitis or some lung trouble left and unknown.\\r\\n\\r\\nCaution.--A person who has had the measles or German measles, should be\\r\\nvery careful about taking cold, for if they do they are liable to have\\r\\nserious trouble, especially in the chest. It is very easy to take\\r\\nbronchitis or pneumonia during and after an attack of measles. The mucous\\r\\nmembrane of these parts is left somewhat swollen and it remains\\r\\nsusceptible to disease for some time. \"An ounce of prevention is worth a\\r\\npound of cure.\" Remain in the house three or four days longer than may\\r\\nseem necessary and you will be paid for so doing by having good bronchial\\r\\ntubes and lungs,--as good as before if you were careful during the attack.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGERMAN MEASLES.--This is an acute self-limited disease and contagious. It\\r\\nhas a mild fever, watery eyes, cough, sore throat and enlargement of the\\r\\nglands of the neck, not seen in the common measles. It has an eruption\\r\\nthat may come the first day to the fourth.\\r\\n\\r\\nIncubation Period Runs.--From fifteen to twenty days.\\r\\n\\r\\nRash.--Just before the rash appears there is a headache, nausea and\\r\\nirritation of the bronchial tubes. The eruption is so similar to that of\\r\\nmeasles at the outset that it is hard to differentiate between them. The\\r\\neruption in the mouth, however, is not so characteristic. Before the\\r\\nappearance of the eruption, the glands on the back of the neck and angles\\r\\nof the jaw may be enlarged. At the time of its appearance the glands in\\r\\nthe armpits and groin become enlarged to the size of a bean and bigger,\\r\\nand they remain enlarged for weeks after the eruption has disappeared.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--Similar to the measles if any is needed.\\r\\n\\r\\nCHICKEN POX (Varicella).--This is an acute infectious disease,\\r\\ncharacterized by a peculiar eruption. Children are the ones usually\\r\\nattacked. It generally occurs before the tenth year. It is transmitted\\r\\nthrough the atmosphere. The period of coming on is usually fourteen days,\\r\\nbut it may extend to nineteen days. It is perhaps the simplest and mildest\\r\\ndisease of childhood. It occurs but once, is contagious, is very common,\\r\\nand resembles varioloid. It has a mild light fever and large vesicles\\r\\nalmost the size of a split pea, scattered over the body. There may be few\\r\\nand there may be hundreds. They are reddish gray and appear first on the\\r\\nhead and face, then on the body, one crop following another on the body.\\r\\nThey are filled at first with a clear liquid, which soon turns yellowish,\\r\\nthen breaks and dries up. They leave no scar unless they are scratched or\\r\\nare very large. The patient is usually well in a week, but the scars last\\r\\nlonger.\\r\\n\\r\\nMOTHER\\'S REMEDY.--1. Chicken Pox, Catnip Tea and Soda Water for.--\"Put\\r\\nthe patient to bed and give catnip tea. A daily bath of saleratus water is\\r\\ngood and the bowels should be kept open.\" One of the most essential things\\r\\nis to keep the patient warm.\\r\\n\\r\\n[180 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nPHYSICIANS\\' TREATMENT FOR CHICKEN POX.--Exclude other children. The child\\r\\nshould be lightly fed and on ordinary food. Large vesicles on the face,\\r\\nwhen yellow, should be pricked with a needle that has been boiled, then\\r\\nwash them with a disinfecting lotion twice daily.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following is a good lotion:\\r\\n\\r\\n    Boric Acid       1/2 ounce (4 teaspoonfuls)\\r\\n    Boiled Water       1 pint\\r\\n\\r\\nMix thoroughly and use twice a day on the eruption.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe child should not pick the sores on his face, as this may cause delay\\r\\nin healing and leave a mark.\\r\\n\\r\\nMUMPS (Parotitis).--This is an acute infectious disease of one or both of\\r\\nthe parotid glands, located at the angle of the jaw, and extending up to\\r\\nthe ear, and, also, to other salivary glands. It appears only once. One\\r\\nattack gives immunity. It may come at any age; but appears mostly before\\r\\nthe age of fifteen. It comes on one side first and may pass over to the\\r\\nother side in a few days, as it usually does, and gives the face a broad\\r\\nappearance, under the ears, or ear, and makes chewing and swallowing\\r\\nalmost impossible. There is no soreness of the throat in mumps. In\\r\\nwell-marked cases there is considerable fever and pain. It may last from a\\r\\nfew days to a week. The usual length of time the disease lasts is one\\r\\nweek. There is no tendency to form pus, even when the face is very hard\\r\\nand swollen and tender. It will occasionally leave the face and appear in\\r\\nthe breasts and ovaries in the females or in the testicles of the males,\\r\\nand in both places it causes much pain.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--The patient should be kept in the house and isolated in bed as\\r\\nlong as the symptoms last. When there is much pain, laudanum diluted\\r\\none-third with water may be applied continually with a soft warm cloth.\\r\\nOil of hyoscyamus applied twice daily to the sore parts is good if\\r\\nlaudanum is not used. When the swelling goes down I know of nothing as\\r\\ngood as a hot bean poultice, which must be changed often so as to keep\\r\\nhot. Bean poultice.--Simply boil the beans in water until they are soft\\r\\nand thick enough to use as a poultice. The bowels should be kept open with\\r\\nsalts. The food must be liquid, such as milk, soups and gruels. If there\\r\\nis not much fever, soft boiled eggs and milk toast from the beginning. Do\\r\\nnot use vinegar, acids or astringents.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[INFECTIOUS DISEASES 181]\\r\\n\\r\\nWHOOPING-COUGH (Pertussis).--Whooping cough is an acute specific\\r\\ninfectious, disease caused by a micro-organism. It is characterized in a\\r\\nmajority of cases by a spasmodic cough, accompanied by a so-called whoop.\\r\\nIt is not only infectious, but very contagious. It is propagated through\\r\\nthe atmosphere in schools and public places; the air of which is\\r\\ncontaminated with the specific agent of the disease. This agent is thought\\r\\nto reside in the sputum and the secretions of the nose and air passages of\\r\\nthe patient. It is very contagious at the height of the attack. The sputum\\r\\nof the first or catarrhal stage is thought to be highly contagious. The\\r\\nsputum in the stage of decline is also thought to be capable of carrying\\r\\nthe disease. It prevails in all countries and climates. During the winter\\r\\nand spring months it is most frequent. At times it prevails as an\\r\\nepidemic. It occurs most frequently in infancy and childhood, but a person\\r\\ncan take it at any age. Second attacks are rare. It is most frequent\\r\\nbetween the first and second year; next most frequent between the sixth\\r\\nand twelfth month. After the fifth year the frequency diminishes up to the\\r\\ntenth year, after which the disease is very infrequent. Not everyone who\\r\\nis exposed contracts the disease. It seems that whooping-cough, measles,\\r\\nand influenza frequently follow one another in epidemic form. This is one\\r\\nof the diseases much dreaded by parents. It is very tedious and endangers\\r\\nthe life of weak and young children by exhaustion. It is a terrible thing\\r\\nto watch one with this disease, day in and day out. It can be known by the\\r\\nimpetuous, continuous and frequent coughing spells, following each other\\r\\nrapidly until the patient is out of breath, with a tendency to end in\\r\\nvomiting. When it comes in the fall or winter months there will likely be\\r\\nspasmodic coughing until summer through the usual colds contracted. Summer\\r\\nis the best time to have it.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--There is an incubation stage, but it is hard to determine its\\r\\nlength. After the appearance of the symptoms there are three stages; the\\r\\ncatarrhal, the spasmodic, and the stage of decline.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe First Stage.--This is characterized by a cough which is more\\r\\ntroublesome at night. One can be suspicious, when instead of getting\\r\\nbetter in a few days, it gets worse and more frequent, without any seeming\\r\\ncause. After four or five days the cough may be accompanied by vomiting,\\r\\nespecially if the cough occurs after eating. There may be some bronchitis,\\r\\nand if so there will be one or more degrees of fever. Fever is present as\\r\\na rule, only during the first few days, unless there is bronchitis. As the\\r\\ncase passes into the spasmodic or second stage, the paroxysms of coughing\\r\\nlast longer, the child becomes red in the face and spits up a larger\\r\\namount of mucus than in ordinary bronchitis. This period of the cough\\r\\nwithout a whoop, may last from five to twelve days. In some cases there is\\r\\nnever a whoop. The child has a severe spasmodic cough, followed by\\r\\nvomiting. Usually at the close of this stage the incessant cough causes\\r\\nslight puffiness of the eyelids and slight bloating of the face.\\r\\n\\r\\n[182 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nSpasmodic or Second Stage.--The peculiar whoop is now present. The cough\\r\\nis spasmodic. The child has distinct paroxysms of coughing which begin\\r\\nwith an inspiration (in-breathing) followed by several expulsive,\\r\\nexplosive coughs, after which there is a deep, long-drawn inspiration\\r\\nwhich is characterized by a loud crowing called the \"whoop.\" This paroxysm\\r\\nmay be followed by a number of similar ones. When the paroxysm is coming\\r\\non the face assumes an anxious expression, and the child runs to the\\r\\nnearest person or to some article of furniture and grasps him or it with\\r\\nboth hands. It is so severe sometimes that the child will fall or claw the\\r\\nair, convulsively. In the severest and most dangerous types, a convulsion\\r\\nmay come on in a moderate degree, the face is red or livid, the eyes bulge\\r\\nand when the paroxysm ends a quantity of sticky tenacious mucus is spit\\r\\nup. In other cases there is vomiting at the end of the paroxysm. There is\\r\\nfrequently nose-bleed. In the intervals the face is pale or bluish,\\r\\neyelids are puffy and face swollen. There is little bronchitis at this\\r\\nperiod in the majority of cases. In some cases the number of paroxysms may\\r\\nbe few. There are generally quite a number during the twenty-four hours.\\r\\n\\r\\nStage of the Decline.--In this stage the number and severity or the\\r\\nparoxysms lessen. They may subside suddenly or gradually after four to\\r\\ntwelve weeks. The whoop may reappear at times. The cough may persist, more\\r\\nor less, for weeks after the whoop is entirely gone.\\r\\n\\r\\nComplications.--Bronchitis is common, it may be mild or severe. It may run\\r\\ninto capillary bronchitis and this is dangerous.\\r\\n\\r\\nDiagnosis.--Continued cough, getting worse and spasmodic, worse at night,\\r\\nlivid face when coughing, causes great suspicion as to its being\\r\\nwhooping-cough. The whoop will confirm it.\\r\\n\\r\\nMortality is quoted as twenty-five per cent during the first year. Between\\r\\nfirst and fifth year about five per cent, from fifth to tenth year about\\r\\none per cent. Rickets, or wasting disease (marasmus) and poor hygienic\\r\\nsurroundings makes the outlook less favorable.\\r\\n\\r\\nMOTHERS\\' REMEDIES. 1. Whooping-Cough, Chestnut Leaves for.--\"Steep\\r\\nchestnut leaves, strain, add sugar according to amount of juice and boil\\r\\ndown to a syrup; give plenty of this. A friend of mine gave this to her\\r\\nchildren. She said they recovered rapidly and the cough was not severe.\"\\r\\nThey are not the horse-chestnut leaves.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Whooping-Cough, Chestnut Leaves and Cream for.--\"Make an infusion of\\r\\ndry chestnut leaves, not too strong, season with cream and sugar, if\\r\\ndesired. The leaves can be purchased at a drug store in five cent\\r\\npackages.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Whooping-Cough, Mrs. Warren\\'s Remedy for.--\\r\\n\\r\\n    \"Powdered Alum         1/2 dram\\r\\n    Mucilage Acacia          1 ounce\\r\\n    Syrup Squills          1/2 ounce\\r\\n    Syrup Simple, q. s       4 ounces\\r\\n\\r\\nMix this.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is one of the best remedies known to use for whooping cough. It has\\r\\nbeen used for many years, and some of our best doctors use it in their\\r\\npractice. I do not hesitate to recommend it as a splendid remedy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Whooping-Cough, Raspberry Tincture for.--\"Take one-half pound honey,\\r\\none cup water; let these boil, take off scum; pour boiling hot upon\\r\\none-half ounce lobelia herb and one-half ounce cloves; mix well, then\\r\\nstrain and add one gill raspberry vinegar. Take from one teaspoonful to a\\r\\ndessertspoonful four times a day. Pleasant to take.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n[INFECTIOUS DISEASES 183]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPHYSICIANS\\' TREATMENT for Whooping-Cough.--The patient should be isolated\\r\\nand sleep in a large, well ventilated room. In spring and summer weather,\\r\\nthe child is better in the open air all day. In the winter the child\\r\\nshould be warmly clothed. Pine wood and a fairly high altitude are\\r\\nprobably the best. The greatest care should be taken in all seasons to\\r\\nkeep from taking cold, or bad bronchitis or pneumonia may result. All\\r\\ncomplications are serious, especially in nursing children. There should be\\r\\nno appreciable fever, and when the paroxysm of cough is over the child\\r\\nshould sleep or play quite well, until the next one returns. So if there\\r\\nis much fever the case needs watching.\\r\\n\\r\\nMedical Treatment.--Medicines have little effect in controlling the\\r\\ndisease. The severity can be lessened. If the child is much disturbed at\\r\\nnight, the following is good:\\r\\n\\r\\n1.    Acetanelid       1/2 dram\\r\\n      Dover\\'s Powder   1/2 dram\\r\\n\\r\\nMix thoroughly and make up into thirty powders; for one year old one-half\\r\\na powder every two hours while awake or restless.\\r\\n\\r\\n2.    Syrup of Dover\\'s Powder         1 fluid dram\\r\\n      Tincture of Aconite            10 drops\\r\\n      Simple Syrup enough to make   two ounces.\\r\\n\\r\\nMix and give one-half teaspoonful every two hours for a child one year\\r\\nold. Shake bottle.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. But the best treatment I know is the following: Go to any good drug\\r\\nstore and get a fifty-cent bottle of vapo-cresolene. Burn this, according\\r\\nto the directions given on the bottle in the evening. Use a small granite\\r\\ncup, put about one-third of an inch of the medicine in this, set cup on a\\r\\nwire frame above a lamp, (can buy a regular lamp with the medicine) close\\r\\nwindows and let the child inhale the fumes. This will give the patient a\\r\\ngood night\\'s sleep. I have used this for years, and know it is good and\\r\\neffective. A tea made of chestnut leaves is said to be good, and is often\\r\\nused as a home remedy. The leaves of the chestnut that we eat, not the\\r\\nhorse-chestnut.\\r\\n\\r\\nDiet.--This is an extremely important part of the treatment. As the child\\r\\nvomits frequently, especially after eating, the food is generally vomited,\\r\\nso there should be frequent feeding in small quantities. The food should\\r\\nbe digestible and nourishing. Milk is a good food for older children. In\\r\\nnursing infants they should be nursed oftener, especially if they vomit\\r\\nsoon after nursing. In older children, you must not feed too heavy and\\r\\nhearty foods; meat and potatoes should not be given to young children\\r\\nhaving the disease. When vomiting is severe the food should be fluid and\\r\\ngiven often. The child must be nourished. If this disease occurs in the\\r\\nwinter the person attacked, after he is seemingly well, must be careful\\r\\nnot to take cold. The condition of the mucous membrane of the air tube\\r\\nafter an attack of this disease, makes it very easy for the person to\\r\\ncontract inflammation of that part and have in consequence laryngitis,\\r\\nbronchitis, or pneumonia. Thc cough in very many cases will last all\\r\\nwinter without any additional cold being added.\\r\\n\\r\\n[184 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nDIPHTHERIA.--Diphtheria is an acute disease and always infectious. There\\r\\nis a peculiar membrane which forms on the tonsils, uvula, soft palate and\\r\\nthroat and sometimes in the larynx and nose. It may form in other places\\r\\nsuch as in the vagina, bowels, on wounds or sores of the skin. I once cut\\r\\noff the fingers for a child under the care of another doctor. The child\\r\\ncame down with diphtheria, and the membrane formed on the fingers. Also it\\r\\nis often epidemic in the cold autumn months. Its severity varies with\\r\\ndifferent epidemics. Children from two to fifteen years old are most\\r\\nfrequently attacked with it. Catarrhal inflammations of the respiratory\\r\\nmucous membrane predisposes to it.\\r\\n\\r\\nCause.--The exciting cause is a bacillus called after the\\r\\ndiscoverers--Klebs-Loeffler--and this may be communicated directly to\\r\\nanother person from the membrane or discharges from the nose and mouth,\\r\\nsecretions of convalescents, or from the throat of normal persons. The\\r\\nlocal condition (lesion) may be a simple catarrhal inflammation, or a\\r\\ngreenish or gray exudate, involving chiefly the tonsils, pharynx, soft\\r\\npalate, nose, larynx and trachea, less often the conjunctiva and\\r\\nalimentary tract. It is firmly adherent at first and leaves a bleeding\\r\\nsurface when detached; later it is soft and can be removed.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--Incubation period usually lasts from two to seven days after\\r\\nexposure, usually two, generally there is chilliness, sometimes\\r\\nconvulsions in young children, pain in the back and extremities and a\\r\\nfever of 102-1/2 to 104 degrees.\\r\\n\\r\\nPHARYNGEAL DIPHTHERIA.--In typical cases this begins with slight\\r\\ndifficulty in swallowing, and reddened throat (pharynx), then there is a\\r\\ngeneral congestion of these parts, and membrane is seen on the tonsils. It\\r\\nis grayish white, then dull or yellowish; adherent and when removed it\\r\\nleaves a bleeding surface upon which a fresh membrane quickly forms. If\\r\\nthe disease runs on, in a few days the membrane covers the tonsils and\\r\\npillars of the fauces, often the uvula. The glands around the neck often\\r\\nenlarge. Temperature 102 to 103 degrees. Pulse 100 to 120. The\\r\\nconstitutional symptoms are usually in proportion to the local condition,\\r\\nbut not always. The membrane frequently extends into the nostrils and\\r\\nfrequently there is a burning discharge. In malignant cases all the\\r\\nsymptoms are severe and rapidly progressive ending in stupor and death in\\r\\nthree to five days. Death may occur from sudden heart failure or\\r\\ncomplications.\\r\\n\\r\\n[INFECTIOUS DISEASES 185]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Diphtheria (view of infected throat)]\\r\\n\\r\\nLARYNGEAL DIPHTHERIA, Formerly Called Membranous Croup.--Diphtheria in\\r\\nthe larynx may occur alone or with the pharyngeal kind, and was formerly\\r\\ncalled \"Membranous Croup.\" After several days of hoarseness and coughing\\r\\nthe breathing suddenly becomes hard, generally at night, and it is at\\r\\nfirst in paroxysms, but later it is constant. The space above the breast\\r\\nbone (sternum) is depressed and there is a drawing in of the spaces\\r\\nbetween the ribs during inspiration accompanied with a husky voice and\\r\\nblue look. The fever is slight. If the obstruction in the larynx is severe\\r\\nthe cyanosis,--blueness,--and difficulty of breathing increase, and\\r\\ngradual suffocation leads to (coma) deep sleep and death.\\r\\n\\r\\nDiagnosis.--Diagnosis can only be made certain by proper chemical tests.\\r\\nThe presence of membrane on a tonsil and a small patch streak, or speck of\\r\\nmembrane, on the adjacent surface of the uvula or tip of the uvula; a\\r\\npatch of membrane on the tonsil and an accompanying patch on the posterior\\r\\nwall of the pharynx; the presence of a croupy cough and harsh breathing\\r\\nwith small patches of membrane on the tonsil or epiglottis. These symptoms\\r\\nare very suspicious and warrant separation of the patient. If such\\r\\nconditions are seen in any one, it will be the part of prudence to send\\r\\nfor your doctor immediately. You give the patient a better chance by\\r\\nsending early, protect yourselves and also your neighbors.\\r\\n\\r\\nRecovery.--Chances in mild cases are good. Antitoxin has brought the death\\r\\nrate down from forty to twelve per cent. Death may occur from sudden heart\\r\\nfailure, obstruction in the pharynx, severe infection, complications or\\r\\nparalysis.\\r\\n\\r\\nMOTHERS\\' REMEDIES.--Diphtheria is such a dangerous disease and so rapidly\\r\\nfatal that the family physician should be promptly called. Until he\\r\\narrives the following may be used to give some relief:\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Diphtheria, Kerosene Good for.--\"Kerosene oil applied to the throat of\\r\\nchild or adult is very good.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Diphtheria, Hops and Hot Water Relieves.--\"Make two flannel bags and\\r\\nfill with hops which have been moistened with hot water; place bags in a\\r\\nsteamer and heat. Keep one bag hot and the other around the throat. Change\\r\\noften, relief in short time.\" Mrs. Shaw has tried this in a case of\\r\\ndiphtheria and other throat trouble and recommends it as an excellent\\r\\nremedy.\\r\\n\\r\\n[186 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nPHYSICIANS\\' TREATMENT for Diphtheria. Prevention.--The patient should be\\r\\nisolated as soon as the spots or membrane are seen. Other children who\\r\\nhave been with the sick one should at once be given \"immunizing\" doses of\\r\\nantitoxin, and the furniture of the sick room such as hangings, carpets.\\r\\nrugs, etc., should be removed and disinfected, only the necessary articles\\r\\nbeing kept in the room. The room should be kept well ventilated, but no\\r\\ndraught should get to the patient. The one nursing the patient should not\\r\\ncome near the other members of the family. All articles of clothing worn\\r\\nby the patient should be dipped in a 1 to 2000 solution of corrosive\\r\\nsublimate before they are removed from the sick room. (Other solutions may\\r\\nbe used; see Nursing Department). Dishes, etc., should be treated in the\\r\\nsame way and foods left over should be put in a vessel containing an\\r\\nantiseptic solution, and then burned. Everyone going into the sick room\\r\\nshould cover their head with a cap and wear a robe-covering over their\\r\\nclothes, and on leaving the room should gargle or rinse their mouth with a\\r\\nsolution of boric acid, about one or two teaspoonfuls to a glass of water,\\r\\nThe infant should not be nursed at the breast lest the breast become\\r\\ninfected; the milk should be pumped out and fed to the infant with a\\r\\nbottle. If the infant has diarrhea milk must be stopped, the bowels\\r\\nirrigated, and no milk given until all danger from this source is past.\\r\\nThe nurse must be careful of the discharges from the nose, mouth and\\r\\nbowels. Discharges from the bowels and the urine must be received in a\\r\\nvessel with an antiseptic solution in it like copperas, lime, etc. Cloths\\r\\nused to receive the discharge from the nose and mouth should be thrown in\\r\\na vessel containing a solution of 1 to 2000 of corrosive sublimate and\\r\\nthen burned. The nurse should wear a gauze protection over her nose and\\r\\nmouth when she is near the patient, and glasses, so that no sputum or\\r\\ndischarge from the patient can enter these organs. When the nurse leaves\\r\\nthe sick room for a rest or walk, she should change her clothes in an\\r\\nunused room and put them where they can air, wash her hands, face and hair\\r\\nin an antiseptic solution. Great care must be taken by the nurse, or she\\r\\nwill carry the disease. The doctor also must take the same care.\\r\\n\\r\\nPHYSICIANS\\' MEDICAL TREATMENT.--Antitoxin is the best. 1/100 grain of\\r\\ncorrosive sublimate or more according to age is frequently given in the\\r\\nsevere cases and is beneficial.\\r\\n\\r\\nLocal Treatment.--In older persons, inhaling steam may benefit. Gargling\\r\\nthe throat or spraying the nose and throat is cleansing and helpful; but\\r\\nin children it is sometimes hard to do this, for they may struggle and\\r\\nthus injure and weaken themselves more than they can be benefited by the\\r\\nspraying or gargling. Swab the throat if you can with solution of\\r\\ncorrosive sublimate, 1 to 1000. Peroxide of hydrogen, one-sixth to one-\\r\\nhalf to full strength, is good in many cases, used as a gargle and a swab.\\r\\nWash out the nose with a normal salt solution. One dram to a pint of\\r\\nwater. The persons doing this must take great care or the patient will\\r\\ncough and the discharge will go over them.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen in the Larynx.--Steam inhalations without or with medicine in them\\r\\nand the application of cold or hot to the neck are good. Compound tincture\\r\\nof benzoin is good to use in the water for steaming; one-half to one\\r\\ntablespoonful to a quart of water. A tent can be made by putting a sheet\\r\\nover the four posts of the bed and steam vapor introduced under this\\r\\ncovering.\\r\\n\\r\\nDiet.--The main food is milk, albumin water, broths, eggs given every two\\r\\nhours. Some doctors give stimulants with the food.\\r\\n\\r\\n[INFECTIOUS DISEASES 187]\\r\\n\\r\\nCautions.--Members of the family have no idea how much they can aid the\\r\\nphysician in this terrible disease. Pay particular attention  to the\\r\\ndirections the doctor gives you, if you are doing the nursing, watch so\\r\\nthat you may detect any bad symptom, and immediately inform the physician.\\r\\nA harsh cough with increased difficulty in breathing may mean that the\\r\\ndisease has extended to the larynx. If such symptoms are first noticed in\\r\\nthe physician\\'s absence, he should be sent for at once so he can treat it\\r\\nproperly at the start. If the kidneys do not act properly he should be\\r\\ninformed. One may take nephritis in diphtheria also. I was called one\\r\\nmorning at 3 a. m., to see a case I was attending; she seemed to the\\r\\nparents to be worse; she was, but today she is living, and I believe her\\r\\nlife was really saved by her parents. I would rather a loving mother and\\r\\nfather nurse a case any time than a selfish, lazy professional nurse. Good\\r\\nnurses are a blessing; selfish ones are a curse; I have met both kinds.\\r\\nAfter an attack of this disease the patient is left \"weak\" in many organs.\\r\\nHe should be careful, not only of taking cold, but of over-doing. The\\r\\nheart and nervous system in some cases have been terribly wrecked. Take\\r\\nlife easy for some time, for you may be thankful that you are alive.\\r\\n\\r\\nACUTE TONSILITIS. (Follicular Inflammation of the Tonsils). Causes.--\\r\\nAuthors regard this as an infectious disease. It is met with more\\r\\nfrequently in the young; infants may take it. Some authors state it can be\\r\\ncommunicated either through the secretions or by direct contact, as in the\\r\\nact of kissing (Koplik). It is frequent in children from the second to the\\r\\nfourth year, but it is more common after than before the fourth year. Sex\\r\\nhas no influence. In this country it is more common in the spring. The\\r\\npredisposing causes are exposure to wet and cold and bad hygienic\\r\\nsurroundings. One attack renders a person more susceptible. It spreads\\r\\nthrough a family in such a way that it must be regarded as contagious. The\\r\\nsmall openings (Lacunae) of the tonsils become filled with products which\\r\\nform cheesy-looking masses, projecting from the openings of the (Crypts)\\r\\nhidden sacs. These frequently join together, the intervening tissue is\\r\\nusually swollen, deep red in color and sometimes a membrane forms on it in\\r\\nwhich case it may look like diphtheria.\\r\\n\\r\\n[188 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--Chilly feelings or even a chill and aching pains in the back\\r\\nand limbs may precede the onset. The fever rises rapidly and in the young\\r\\nchild may reach 105 degrees in the evening of the first day. The infant is\\r\\nrestless, peevish and wakeful at night; it breathes rapidly, and there is\\r\\nhigh fever and great weakness. Nursing is difficult, not only on account\\r\\nof the pain in swallowing, but because in the majority of cases there is\\r\\nmore or less inflammation of the nose. The bowels are disturbed as a\\r\\nresult of swallowing infectious secretions from the mouth with the food.\\r\\nThe tonsils are enlarged and studded with whitish or yellowish white\\r\\npoints. The glands at the angle of the jaws may be enlarged. In older\\r\\nchildren the tonsils are enlarged and the crypts plugged with a creamy\\r\\ndeposit. The surface is covered with a deposit and the pillars of the\\r\\nfauces, uvula and pharynx may all be inflamed. The tongue is coated, the\\r\\nbreath is bad, the urine high colored, swallowing is painful; the pain\\r\\nfrequently runs to the ear and the voice sounds nasal, as if one had mush\\r\\nin his mouth when talking. In severe cases the symptoms all increase, and\\r\\nthe parts become very much swollen. Then the inflammation gradually\\r\\nsubsides, and in a week, as a rule, the fever is gone and the local\\r\\nconditions have greatly improved. The tonsils, though, remain somewhat\\r\\nswollen. The weakness and general symptoms are often greater than one\\r\\nwould suppose. The trouble may also extend to the middle ear through the\\r\\neustachian tubes.\\r\\n\\r\\nDiagnosis Between Acute Tonsilitis and Diphtheria.--Follicular form. \"In\\r\\nthis form the individual, yellowish, gray masses, separated by the reddish\\r\\ntonsilar tissue are very characteristic, whereas in diphtheria the\\r\\nmembrane is of ashy gray and uniform, not patch.\"--Osler. A point of the\\r\\ngreatest importance in diphtheria is that the membrane is not limited to\\r\\nthe tonsils, but creeps up the pillars of the fauces or appears on the\\r\\nuvula. The diphtheric membrane when removed leaves a raw, bleeding, eroded\\r\\nsurface; whereas, the membrane of follicular tonsilitis is easily\\r\\nseparated as there is no raw surface beneath it.\\r\\n\\r\\nMOTHERS\\' REMEDIES. 1. Tonsilitis, Raw Onion and Pork for.--\"Take a raw\\r\\nonion and some salt pork, chop together, make a poultice on which put a\\r\\nlittle turpentine and wrap around the throat.\" This is a very good remedy\\r\\nand should be used for some time. Change as often as necessary.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Tonsilitis, Peppermint Oil Good for.--\"Apply peppermint oil thoroughly\\r\\non the outside of the throat from well up behind the ear nearly to the\\r\\nchin, also just in front of the ear. This will soon penetrate through to\\r\\nthe tonsils; apply freely if the case is severe and later apply hot cloths\\r\\nif relief does not follow without.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Tonsilitis, Borax Water for.--\"One-fourth teaspoonful borax in one cup\\r\\nof hot water, gargle frequently.\" This may be used for ordinary sore\\r\\nthroat not quite so strong.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Tonsilitis, Salt and Pepper Will Relieve.--\"Apply salt pork well\\r\\ncovered with pepper to the swollen parts; will often give relief.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n5. Tonsilitis, Peroxide of Hydrogen Will Cure.--\"Tonsilitis and contagious\\r\\nsore throats are just now extremely popular. Persons having a tendency to\\r\\nthem will seldom be sick if they gargle daily with a solution of peroxide\\r\\nof hydrogen and water in equal parts for adults. Peroxide diluted with\\r\\nfive parts of water and used as a head spray will prevent catarrhal\\r\\ncolds.\" Children, are often sent to school immediately after an attack of\\r\\ntonsilitis, when they should be at home taking a tonic and building up by\\r\\na week of outdoor play.\\r\\n\\r\\n6. Tonsilitis, a Remedy Effective for.--\"Rub the outside of the throat\\r\\nwell with oil of anise and turpentine, and keep the bowels open.\" Care\\r\\nshould be taken not to take cold. The anise is very soothing and the\\r\\nturpentine will help to draw out the soreness. This would be a good remedy\\r\\nfor children.\\r\\n\\r\\n[INFECTIOUS DISEASES 189]\\r\\n\\r\\nPHYSICIANS\\' TREATMENT for Tonsilitis. 1. First Home Treatment.--Put the\\r\\npatient to bed alone in a pleasant room, comfortably warm; for this\\r\\ndisease is recorded as contagious in this form. Cold applied externally\\r\\naround the sore spot is good. Use an ice bag if you have it; or wring\\r\\ncloths out of cold water and put just under the jaw and a flannel over\\r\\nthat, bound around the neck. It must be changed often to keep cold.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Smartweed.--Cloths wrung out of smartweed tea are very good when\\r\\napplied under the jaw.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Salt Pork.--Salt pork, well salted and peppered, sewn to a cloth and\\r\\napplied on both sides, if both are diseased, directly to the lumps is very\\r\\ngood. These can be kept on indefinitely. I have used them.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Liniment.--A strong blistering liniment applied externally where the\\r\\nlumps are is also good. These applications tend to withdraw some of the\\r\\nblood from the sore tonsils, and of course, that relieves them. There are\\r\\nmany such that can be used. Poultices should not be applied for this form\\r\\nas they tend to hasten formation of pus.\\r\\n\\r\\n5. Internally.--Dip your clean moistened finger tip into dry bicarbonate\\r\\nof soda (baking soda), rub this gently on the sore tonsil and repeat it\\r\\nevery hour. You can also put one teaspoonful of it in one-half glass of\\r\\nvery hot water and gargle if you do not use it locally.\\r\\n\\r\\n6. Hot Water.--Gargling frequently with very hot water is splendid. If you\\r\\nwish you can use one teaspoonful of some antiseptic, like listerine, in\\r\\nit.\\r\\n\\r\\n7. Thyme.--You can make a tea of the common garden thyme and gargle or\\r\\nrinse your mouth and throat with it every half to one hour. This is not\\r\\nonly healing and soothing, but it is also antiseptic. This is a\\r\\nconstituent of many of the antiseptic preparations.\\r\\n\\r\\n8. Steaming With Compound Tincture of Benzoin.--Tincture of benzoin is\\r\\nsplendid. Put one tablespoonful in a quart of hot water and inhale the\\r\\nsteam. Put a sheet over your head and pitcher; or put it in a kettle, and\\r\\nroll white writing paper into a funnel, tie one part over the spout and\\r\\nput the other end in your mouth if possible; or you can inhale simple\\r\\nsteam in the same way. I know this is excellent and often recommended;\\r\\neveryone has it, and it costs literally nothing, except to heat the water.\\r\\n\\r\\n9. For the Pain.--Dissolve two drams of chloral hydrate in an ounce of\\r\\nwater, use a camel\\'s hair pencil if you have it, or a soft piece of cloth\\r\\ntied on a smooth stick, and apply directly to the diseased parts. This is\\r\\nfor older persons, relieves the pain very much. There are many other\\r\\nsimple remedies that can be used in this way.\\r\\n\\r\\n[190 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\n10. MEDICINES. Parke, Davis & Co., Anti-Tonsilitis Tablet No. 645 is very\\r\\ngood. This can be bought at any drug store. For a child give one-half a\\r\\ntablet every two hours for four doses, then every three hours. An adult\\r\\ncan take one to two every one to three hours according to the severity of\\r\\nthe case.\\r\\n\\r\\n11. Aspirin.--Aspirin is another good remedy; five grains every four hours\\r\\nfor an adult; but used only under doctor\\'s directions.\\r\\n\\r\\n12. Dr. Hare of Philadelphia, uses 1/200 grain mercurius biniodide (pink\\r\\npowder) every four to six hours to abort tonsilitis. I would recommend the\\r\\nfollowing:--Give one-tenth drop dose of a good tincture of aconite and\\r\\n1/200 grain of the mercury biniodide (one to two tablets a dose) every\\r\\nhour, alternately, one of them one hour and the next, etc. If there is\\r\\nmuch deposit I would put ten tablets of mercury protoiodide (one-tenth of\\r\\na grain in a tablet) in one-half glass of water and give two teaspoonfuls\\r\\nevery hour until the bowels move freely, then every three to four hours.\\r\\nThe aconite can be used if there is much fever, with hot, dry skin,\\r\\nalternately everyone-half hour. I prefer the pink powder when there is no\\r\\ndeposit or membrane. These I have used for years, and know them to be\\r\\nexcellent. For children the dose is about one-half. After twelve hours the\\r\\nremedies should be given only every three to four hours.\\r\\n\\r\\nQUINSY. (Suppurative Tonsilitis).--In from two to four days the enlarged\\r\\ngland becomes softer and finally may break, sometimes in the pharynx; the\\r\\nbreaking gives the patient great relief. Suffocation has sometimes\\r\\nfollowed the rupture of a large abscess and the entrance of the pus into\\r\\nthe larynx. This form of tonsilitis was formerly called quinsy. By this\\r\\nterm now is meant an abscess around the tonsils, (Peri-tonsilar abscess).\\r\\nThe structures are very much swollen.\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses are somewhat similar to what has produced the regular tonsilitis.\\r\\nIt may follow exposure to cold and wet, and is very liable to recur. It is\\r\\nmost common between fourteen and twenty-five years. The inflammation here\\r\\nis more deeply seated. It involves the main tissue of the tonsil and tends\\r\\nto go on to suppuration.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--The general disturbance is very great. The fever goes to 104 or\\r\\n105 degrees; the pulse 110 to 120. Delirium at night is not uncommon. The\\r\\nweakness may be extreme. The throat is dry and sore, hurts terribly to\\r\\nswallow, this being the first thing of which the patient complains. Both\\r\\ntonsils may be involved. They become large, firm to the touch, dusky red\\r\\nand swollen, and the surrounding parts are also much swollen. The swelling\\r\\nmay be so great that the tonsils may touch each other or one tonsil may\\r\\npush the uvula aside and almost touch the other tonsil. There is much\\r\\nsaliva. The glands of the neck enlarge, the lower jaw is almost immovable\\r\\nand sometimes it is almost impossible to open the mouth at all.\\r\\n\\r\\nQUINSY. Mothers\\' Remedies. 1. Willow Gargle for.--\"Steep pussy willow and\\r\\ngargle throat with it. This remedy if taken in time, will cure quinsy and\\r\\nit will not return.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n[INFECTIOUS DISEASES 191]\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Quinsy, Liveforever Root Good Poultice for.--\"Get the root of\\r\\nliveforever, pound it up and bind on throat as you would a poultice.\" We\\r\\nhave tried this, and it has always given relief, if done in time.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Quinsy, Plaster of Lard and Salt for.--\"Take one tablespoonful lard and\\r\\nstir into as much table salt as possible making it about like mortar.\\r\\nSpread on a cloth and apply.\" Splendid for sore throat and quinsy.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Quinsy, Oil of Anise Effective for.--\"Rub inside of throat with oil of\\r\\nanise.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n5. Quinsy, Quick Remedy for.--\"In severe cases of quinsy where the tonsils\\r\\nare inflamed and almost meet, a third of a grain of mercury and chalk, or\\r\\n\"gray powder,\" acts very quickly. Cold compresses used nightly to harden\\r\\nthe throat is very good. At night use a gargle made of a teaspoonful\\r\\ntincture of cayenne pepper to half pint of water.\" This remedy is very\\r\\ngood and is sure to give relief.\\r\\n\\r\\n6. Quinsy, Pleasant Peppermint Application for.--\"There is nothing better\\r\\nfor this disease than oil of peppermint applied externally to the neck and\\r\\nthroat.\" This is an excellent remedy.\\r\\n\\r\\n7. Quinsy, Kerosene Good for.--\"A cloth wet with kerosene oil applied to\\r\\nthe throat is very good; also gargling with kerosene oil.\" Repeat the\\r\\napplication of the wet cloths every two or three hours.\\r\\n\\r\\n8. Quinsy, Raw Beef Has Cured.--\"Bind raw beefsteak over the tonsils on\\r\\none or both sides of the throat as required.\" The beefsteak acts as a\\r\\npoultice and counter-irritant, drawing the inflammation out in a short\\r\\ntime. This is very good, and is easily prepared.\\r\\n\\r\\n9. Quinsy, Easy and Simple Remedy for.--\"Strong sulphur water. Broke up\\r\\ntwo cases I know.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPHYSICIANS\\' TREATMENT for Quinsy.--The external applications used should\\r\\nnow be hot. Hot water; hot poultices, cloths wrung out of smartweed hot,\\r\\nand thyme tea or golden seal teas. The same steaming process and hot water\\r\\ngargles can be used as given under follicular tonsilitis. But if it\\r\\ncontinues the tonsils or tonsil must be opened to save pain and life. Just\\r\\nas soon as there is suppuration they should be opened. It will feel softer\\r\\nto the finger touch when ready for opening.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrevention of Attacks.--By taking care a good many attacks of tonsilitis\\r\\ncan be avoided. A person subject to this trouble must be careful about\\r\\ntaking cold. He should not sit down with wet clothes, or feet, or shoes\\r\\nthat are wet. Girls should wear rubbers and keep dry feet and skirts.\\r\\nSleeping in damp unused beds is bad. Putting on underwear that has not\\r\\nbeen dried thoroughly and aired, and the use of bedding, pillows, etc., in\\r\\nthe same condition should not be tolerated. Sleeping on the first floor is\\r\\ngenerally unhealthy for such persons, for it is generally damp.\\r\\n\\r\\n[192 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nDo not get chilled; wear sufficient clothing. Drying clothes in a kitchen\\r\\nis an abomination and terrible to one subject to this disease or\\r\\nrheumatism. You can keep from having it so often by proper care. It is\\r\\nlikely to return, and repeated attacks will cause permanently enlarged\\r\\ntonsils and they will become so diseased that they, will not only be\\r\\nannoying, but dangerous to health and life. You will go around with your\\r\\nmouth open, \"talk through your nose.\" The tonsil must then be removed,\\r\\nalso the adenoids in the throat, to enjoy proper mental and physical\\r\\nhealth. Enlarged tonsils with pus in them are a menace to anyone. A person\\r\\nwho has had these troubles should be careful not to expose himself to the\\r\\ndanger of taking cold after an attack.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe parts are still tender and in danger of a return upon the least error\\r\\nin your daily life. I once had a friend who had a return of tonsilitis\\r\\nbrought on through going out too soon, and the second attack was worse\\r\\nthan the first, a genuine \"hummer.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat to do with enlarged tonsils.--Moderate enlargement of the tonsils\\r\\ngiving rise to no symptoms or inconvenience need not be interfered with.\\r\\nWhen, however, the enlargement is great, or when with moderate sized\\r\\ntonsils there are resulting troubles, such as liability to inflammatory\\r\\nrheumatism attacks, active local treatment will be called for; especially\\r\\nis this true when the tonsils contain pus and interfere with the\\r\\nbreathing. They should be removed. An anaesthetic is not usually\\r\\nnecessary, as the pain is not severe.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nINFLUENZA (La Grippe).--La Grippe is an acute infectious disease caused by\\r\\na germ. It may be epidemic, attacking a large number of persons at one\\r\\ntime, or it may continue in the same region for some time and is then\\r\\ncalled endemic. It is caused by a germ, discovered by a man named\\r\\nPfeiffer.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Onset.--The onset may be from one to four days and is usually sudden\\r\\nwith a chill and all the symptoms of an active fever due to a general\\r\\ninfection, varying according to the location. If in the organs of\\r\\nrespiration it begins like a severe cold; active fever, severe pains in\\r\\nthe eyes, back, arms, legs, and in the bones; \"aches all over\" and great\\r\\nprostration. After the fever subsides there is usually a general sore\\r\\nfeeling. Symptoms of bronchitis, pleurisy or pneumonia may develop. Then\\r\\nthere is the nervous type, generally with a bad headache, neuralgia, pains\\r\\nin the head, backache, legs and arms ache and prostration. May also have\\r\\ninflammation of nerves. Then again the stomach and bowels may be the main\\r\\nseat, for La Grippe has no respect for any organ. We have then symptoms of\\r\\nacute indigestion with fever, nausea, vomiting, stomach pains or acute\\r\\nbowel trouble with fever, colicky pain in the abdomen; diarrhea; or we may\\r\\nhave the febrile (fever) type. This may be the only symptom. The fever may\\r\\nbe continuous or remittent, and last several days or several weeks and\\r\\noften with pains accompanying it.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn all forms convalescence is often gradual on account of the bodily and\\r\\nmental prostration with general soreness for several days. Many persons\\r\\nnever fully regain their health, especially if they are careless during\\r\\nthe attack, and almost any disease like bronchitis, kidney disease,\\r\\npleurisy, pneumonia, etc., may follow.\\r\\n\\r\\n[INFECTIOUS DISEASES 193]\\r\\n\\r\\nLA GRIPPE, Mothers\\' Remedies.--1. Pepper, Red or Cayenne for.--\"Make a tea\\r\\nof red pepper or cayenne, and take a tablespoonful in a cup of hot water,\\r\\ndrink slowly, before each meal and on retiring. Larger doses in proportion\\r\\nto the intensity of the disease.\" Sponging the face, temples and neck with\\r\\nwater as hot as can be borne relieves the headache of la grippe, which is\\r\\noften very painful and annoying.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. La Grippe, Easy Remedy for.--\"Plenty of good physic with hot teas of\\r\\nany kind has helped my own family.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n3. La Grippe, Pleasant and Effective Remedy for.--\"Use the oil of\\r\\npeppermint freely; rubbing it on the forehead, in front and back of the\\r\\nears and each side of the nose. Inhale through each nostril separately. If\\r\\nthe throat is affected pour two or three drops in small dish of hot water.\\r\\nInvert a funnel over the dish with the small end in the mouth and draw\\r\\nlong breaths. Soak the feet in hot water at bedtime and take a good sweat,\\r\\nif possible.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n4. La Grippe, To Allay Fever in.--\"To produce sweating and to act on the\\r\\nkidneys and to allay restlessness in fever use the following: Lemon juice\\r\\nand water equal parts, enough to make four ounces; bicarbonate of\\r\\npotassium, one dram; water, three ounces. Make and keep in separate\\r\\nsolutions to be used in tablespoonful doses several times daily and taken\\r\\nwhile effervescing, that is, foaming and bubbling up.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n5. La Grippe. Poor Man\\'s Herb Vapor Bath for.--\"Give a Turkish or vapor\\r\\nbath every other day. A pail of hot water, with a hot brick thrown into it\\r\\nand placed under a cane-seated chair is the poor man\\'s vapor bath. The\\r\\npatient should be covered. Then take the following herb tea:\\r\\n\\r\\n    Yarrow      2 ounces\\r\\n    Vervain     2 ounces\\r\\n    Mullein     2 ounces\\r\\n    Boneset     1 ounce\\r\\n    Red Sage    2 ounces\\r\\n\\r\\nAdd two quarts of water and boil down to three pints; strain, and then add\\r\\none ounce fluid extract of ginger; sweeten with honey or syrup; take a\\r\\nwine glassful three times a day, hot. Keep the bowels open and let the\\r\\ndiet be light.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n6. La Grippe, Red Pepper Treatment From Canada for.--\"Take a bottle of\\r\\nalcohol and put enough red peppers in it so that when four drops of this\\r\\nliquid are put in a half cup of water it tastes strong. This is what I\\r\\nalways break up my grippe with.\" Peppers thus prepared stimulates and\\r\\nwarms up the stomach and bowels, and increases the circulation.\\r\\n\\r\\n[194 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nPHYSICIANS\\' TREATMENT for La Grippe.--All discharges from the nose, throat\\r\\nand lungs should be disinfected, for the disease is contagious. Go to bed\\r\\nand stay there. You have no business to be around if you value your\\r\\nhealth. I am not writing of common cold. A great many people say they have\\r\\nhad this disease when they have not had it. One who has had this disease\\r\\nis sick enough to go to bed, and there is where he should be. For the\\r\\nchill a sweat should be produced by putting hot water in fruit jars,\\r\\nwrapping them and placing them around the patient\\'s feet, legs and body.\\r\\nHot tea drinks can be given; hot lemonade, teas made from hoarhound,\\r\\nginger, hops and catnip are good.\\r\\n\\r\\nCorn Sweat.--The corn sweat can be used. Put from ten to twenty-five ears\\r\\nof corn in a boiler, boil thoroughly until the boiled corn smell appears,\\r\\nthen put the corn ears into five packs, putting from two to five ears in a\\r\\npack, according to the age of the patient. Use cloths or towels, but do\\r\\nnot put the ears in contact, wrap the cloth between them. Put one pack to\\r\\nthe feet and one at each side of the hips, and in each armpit. This will\\r\\nsoon cause sweating and restore the external (capillary) circulation. It\\r\\nwill generally produce a grateful sweat. Keep the clothes on the patient.\\r\\nAfter the patient has perspired enough you can remove one pack at a time.\\r\\nHave fresh aired sheets and night dress ready, and after bathing the\\r\\npatient slowly and carefully under the clothes with tepid water and drying\\r\\nall of the body put on the new night-dress and sheets. This remedy is also\\r\\ngood for colds and inflammatory diseases of all kinds and when used\\r\\ncarefully and thoroughly is always good. Of course, if there is great\\r\\nweakness it cannot be used, for it weakens a patient somewhat. I have\\r\\nsaved lives with this sweat, and I know I have cut short many colds and\\r\\ninflammatory diseases. After the sweat the patient should have enough\\r\\ncovering to keep comfortably warm and care must be taken to keep from the\\r\\ncold.\\r\\n\\r\\nFever.--If the disease goes on and there is high fever, so that the\\r\\npatient suffers from it, it is better to reduce it by cool sponging than\\r\\nby the coal tar products like antipyrin, acetanilid, etc. They are\\r\\nweakening and this is a weakening, prostrating disease. Good, careful cool\\r\\nsponging generally relieves the excessive fever and restlessness. The\\r\\nfever does not continue so long in this disease and it is not, therefore,\\r\\nso harmful. Delirium is present in some cases when the fever is not high.\\r\\n\\r\\nIrritating Cough.--This can frequently he controlled by steam inhalations\\r\\nas directed under tonsilitis. You can also put in the steaming water one\\r\\nteaspoonful to one tablespoonful of compound tincture of benzoin for this\\r\\ndisease. Hoarhound tea can be put in the water and the steam inhaled. If\\r\\nsuch measures do not stop the cough, medicine will be needed.\\r\\n\\r\\n[INFECTIOUS DISEASES 195]\\r\\n\\r\\nSore Throat.--Spraying the throat with a solution of boric acid, one dram\\r\\nto one pint of hot water, is good. Listerine is good in the same way and\\r\\ndose.\\r\\n\\r\\nBowels.--They should be kept open from the first. Salts are usually handy\\r\\nand good.\\r\\n\\r\\nMedicines.--Ten grains Dover\\'s powder at night is good; unless there is\\r\\nmuch weakness. Some give quinine, some salol. Quinine, one to two grains,\\r\\nis given one to three hours. Salol, five grains, every three hours,\\r\\nespecially for the backache.\\r\\n\\r\\nAspirin in five-grain doses for an adult every four hours is given very\\r\\nmuch now. The bowels should be kept open with salts.\\r\\n\\r\\nDiet.--Children should take milk if there is no vomiting or diarrhea. If\\r\\nthere is vomiting and diarrhea, give only water or diluted milk, or\\r\\nnothing if they continue. Water can generally be given.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor adults a good, nourishing diet when convalescence commences is\\r\\nnecessary. During the sickness, milk, eggs,--raw and soft boiled, broths,\\r\\nsoups, milk toast, can be given. A person must be very careful after an\\r\\nattack of the grip. He should remain in the house for some time, a week\\r\\nafter he is well and thinks he can go out.\\r\\n\\r\\nTYPHOID FEVER.--Typhoid fever is an acute infectious disease caused by a\\r\\n(Bacillus) germ, named after the discoverer (Eberth). This germ enters\\r\\ninto the system, as stated below, locates itself in different organs,\\r\\nespecially in the small intestine. It does its worst work in Peyer\\'s\\r\\nglands, situated in the small intestines. They enlarge, ulcerate, break\\r\\ndown and their structure is cast off into the bowel. This eating goes so\\r\\nfar, in some cases, that it eats through the tissue to the blood vessels\\r\\nand other bleeding follows. Sometimes it goes through all the coats, the\\r\\nperitoneal being the last one. If this occurs we have what is called\\r\\nperforation of the bowel and the peritoneum around this perforation\\r\\ninflames and there is the dread complication of peritonitis. This is very\\r\\nfatal, as the patient is weakened from the inroads of weeks of fever and\\r\\nfrom the effects of the poison germ. Typhoid fever is also characterized\\r\\nby its slow (insidious), slyly, creeping onset, peculiar temperature,\\r\\nbloating of the abdomen, diarrhea, swelling of the spleen, rose-colored\\r\\nspots and a liability to complications, such as bleeding from the bowels,\\r\\nperitonitis, bronchitis and pneumonia. Its average duration is three to\\r\\nfour weeks, often longer. In order to take this disease there must first\\r\\nbe the poison germ and then this enters into the system, generally through\\r\\nwater that contains the germ, milk, oysters and other foods, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nCause.--The typhoid bacillus (typhoid). This enters into the alimentary\\r\\ncanal usually through contaminated water or with milk directly infected by\\r\\nthe milk or by water used in washing cans. Also through food to which the\\r\\ngerms are carried from the excreta (discharges) by flies, occasionally\\r\\nthrough oysters by freshening.\\r\\n\\r\\nFilth, improper drainage and poor ventilation favor the preservation of\\r\\nthe bacillus germ and lower the power of resistance in those exposed.\\r\\n\\r\\n[196 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nTime.--It occurs most frequently between August and November and in those\\r\\nof from fifteen to twenty years of age. The Peyer\\'s patches and solitary\\r\\nglands of the bowel enlarge, become reddish and are somewhat raised. These\\r\\ngo on and ulcerate until the blood vessels may be eaten into and bleeding\\r\\nsometimes results, it eats through the bowel, then there is perforation\\r\\nand peritonitis. The spleen is enlarged, the liver shows changes, the\\r\\nkidney functions are also deranged.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--The symptoms are variable. The following gives the symptoms in\\r\\na typical case:\\r\\n\\r\\nIncubation.--The period of incubation lasts from eight to fourteen and\\r\\nsometimes to twenty-three days. During the period the patient feels weak,\\r\\nis almost unable to work, has chilly feelings, headache and tiring dreams,\\r\\ndoes not know what is the matter with him, constipation or diarrhea, has\\r\\nno appetite, may have some pain in the abdomen which is occasionally\\r\\nlocalized in the right lower side. Soreness on deep pressure is often\\r\\nfound there. In some cases there is nosebleed.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst Week.--After the patient is obliged to take to his bed: During the\\r\\nfirst week there is in some cases a steady rise in the fever each evening\\r\\nshowing a degree or degree and one-half higher than the preceding evening,\\r\\nreaching 103 to 104, and each morning showing higher fever than the\\r\\npreceding morning. The pulse is characteristically low in proportion to\\r\\nthe temperature, being about 100 to 110, full of low tension, often having\\r\\ndouble beat. The tongue is coated; there is constipation or diarrhea; the\\r\\nabdomen is somewhat distended and a little tender to the touch in the\\r\\nlower right portion. There may be some mental confusion at night.\\r\\nBronchitis is often present. The spleen becomes enlarged between the\\r\\nseventh and tenth day and the eruption usually appears during this period\\r\\non the stomach and abdomen.\\r\\n\\r\\nSecond week.--All the symptoms are intensified in the second week, the\\r\\nfever is always high and the weakening type; the pulse is more frequent;\\r\\nthe headache is replaced by dullness; the bowel symptoms increase and we\\r\\nhave the \"pea soup\" discharge if there is diarrhea; there is a listless,\\r\\ndull expression on the face; the tongue is coated in the center, red along\\r\\nthe edges and the tip, becomes dry and sometimes cracked and almost\\r\\nuseless. It is hard to put it out of the mouth, it sticks to the teeth or\\r\\nlips and curls there, and sometimes the patient allows it to remain partly\\r\\nout of the mouth. There may be bleeding from the bowels and perforation of\\r\\nthe bowel, producing peritonitis.\\r\\n\\r\\n[INFECTIOUS DISEASES 197]\\r\\n\\r\\nThird week.--The temperature is lower in the morning with a gradual fall;\\r\\nthe emaciation and weakness are marked. Perforation of the bowel or\\r\\nbleeding may occur. Unfavorable symptoms now include low muttering,\\r\\ndelirium, shakings of the muscles, twitching of the tendons, grasping at\\r\\nimaginary things, lung complications and heart weakness.\\r\\n\\r\\nFourth week.--In a favorable case: The fever gradually falls to normal,\\r\\nthe other symptoms disappear. Death may occur at any time after the second\\r\\nweek from the disease or complications. The convalescence is very gradual\\r\\nand the appetite is very great.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpecial symptoms and variations.--It may come on with a chill sometimes it\\r\\nis observed by nervous symptoms only.\\r\\n\\r\\nWalking type.--In this type the patient is able to be around and can walk.\\r\\nThe temperature is as high, but some of the other symptoms are not so\\r\\nviolent. This is a dangerous kind because the patient is able to walk and\\r\\nthinks it foolish to remain quiet in bed. Walking and being around are\\r\\nlikely to injure the bowels, and there is then more danger of bleeding\\r\\nfrom the bowels. A typhoid fever patient should always go to bed and\\r\\nremain there until he has fully recovered.\\r\\n\\r\\nDigestive Symptoms.--The tongue is coated, white and moist at first, and\\r\\nin the second week it becomes red at the tip, and at the edges. Later it\\r\\nis dry, brown and cracked. The teeth and lips are covered with a brown\\r\\nmaterial, called sordes.\\r\\n\\r\\nDiarrhea.--In some cases constipation is prominent, in others diarrhea is\\r\\na prominent symptom. Bloating is frequent, and an unfavorable symptom,\\r\\nwhen it is excessive. Bleeding from the bowel occurs usually between the\\r\\nend of the second and the beginning of the fourth week. A sudden feeling\\r\\nof collapse, and rapid fall of the temperature mark it. It is not always\\r\\nfatal.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerforation of the bowel is usually shown by a sudden sharp pain coming in\\r\\nparoxysms generally localized in the right lower side. The death rate\\r\\nvaries very much; in hospitals it is seven to eight per cent. Unfavorable\\r\\nsymptoms are continued high fever, delirium and hemorrhage. Persons who\\r\\nare hard drinkers do badly and very many of them die.\\r\\n\\r\\nTREATMENT. Prevention. Sanitary Care.--Do away with the causes. Keep your\\r\\ncellars clean; do not have them damp, filthy, and filled with decaying\\r\\nmatter, as these all tend to weaken the system and make you more\\r\\nsusceptible to the poison. In the country, no drainings should come near\\r\\nthe wells or springs. Not all water that looks clear and nice is pure. The\\r\\n\"out-houses\" must be kept clean, and emptied at least twice each year. In\\r\\nthe small cities, especially, the water should be boiled during the months\\r\\nwhen the supply is limited and the wells are low. If more attention was\\r\\npaid to our water supply to make certain that it was not contaminated, and\\r\\nto our foods, especially milk, and to keeping our cellars and drains in a\\r\\ngood clean and dry condition, we would have little typhoid fever.\\r\\nCarelessness is the real cause of this terrible disease. The milk should\\r\\nbe boiled as well as the water when there is an epidemic of typhoid.\\r\\n\\r\\n[198 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nSanitary Care of the Household Articles.--Dishes must be isolated, washed,\\r\\ndried separately and boiled daily. Thermometers must be isolated, kept in\\r\\na corrosive sublimate solution one to one thousand, which must be removed\\r\\ndaily. Linen when soiled must be soaked in carbolic acid, one cup of\\r\\ncarbolic acid to twenty of water, for two hours before being sent to the\\r\\nlaundry. Stools must be thoroughly mixed with an equal amount of milk of\\r\\nlime and allowed to stand for one hour. Urine must be mixed with an equal\\r\\namount of carbolic acid, one to twenty, and allowed to stand one hour. Bed\\r\\npans, urinals, must be isolated and scalded after each time of using.\\r\\nSyringes and rectal tubes must be isolated, and the latter boiled after\\r\\nusing. (See Nursing Department). Tubs should be scrubbed daily, canvasses\\r\\nchanged daily and soaked in carbolic acid as the linen is. Hands must be\\r\\nscrubbed and disinfected after giving tubs or rubbing over typhoid fever\\r\\npatients. Blankets, mattresses, and pillows must be sterilized after use\\r\\nin steam sterilizer. I know some people have not all the necessary\\r\\nconveniences, especially in the country, but the greatest care must be\\r\\ntaken. A professional nurse was once taking care of a very severe case of\\r\\ntyphoid for me. I was continually cautioning her to be more careful of\\r\\nherself. She did not heed it, and finally took the disease and battled\\r\\neight long weeks with it, before there was much improvement. Careful\\r\\nnursing and a well regulated diet are the essentials in a majority of\\r\\ncases. Put the patient in a well ventilated room, and confine him to the\\r\\nbed from the beginning, and have him remain there until well. The woven\\r\\nwire bed with soft hair mattress, upon which there are two folds of\\r\\nblanket, combines the two great qualities of a sick bed, smoothness and\\r\\nelasticity. A rubber cloth should be placed under the sheet. An\\r\\nintelligent nurse should be in charge; when this is impossible, the\\r\\nattending physician should write out special instructions, regarding diet,\\r\\ntreatment of the discharges and of the bed linen.\\r\\n\\r\\nMuch of the above on typhoid is from the world-wide authority, Dr. Osler,\\r\\nand should be-followed in all cases if possible.\\r\\n\\r\\nDiet and Nursing in Typhoid Fever.--Milk is the most suitable food. Three\\r\\npints every twenty-four hours may be given when used alone, diluted with\\r\\nwater or lime-water.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe stools will show if the milk is digested. Peptonized milk, if not\\r\\ndistasteful, may be used. Curds are seen in the stools if too much milk is\\r\\ngiven and is undigested. Mutton or chicken broth or beef juice can be\\r\\nused; fresh vegetable juices can be added to these, instead of milk. The\\r\\nanimal broths are not so good when diarrhea is present. Some patients will\\r\\ntake whey, buttermilk, kumiss, when ordinary milk is distasteful. Thin\\r\\nbarley gruel well strained is an excellent food for this disease. Eggs may\\r\\nbe given, either beaten up in milk or better still, in the form of albumin\\r\\nwater, This is prepared by straining the whites of eggs through a cloth\\r\\nand mixing them with an equal quantity of water, which may be flavored\\r\\nwith lemon. Water can be given freely; iced tea, barley water, or lemonade\\r\\nmay be used, and there is no objection to weak coffee or cocoa in moderate\\r\\nquantities. Feed the patient at stated intervals. In mild cases it is well\\r\\nnot to arouse the patient at night. When there is stupor, the patient\\r\\nshould be aroused for food at the regular intervals night and day. Do not\\r\\ngive too much food. I once had a case in which I did not give more than\\r\\none quart of liquid food in four weeks, as it distressed her. She made a\\r\\ngood recovery on plenty of water.\\r\\n\\r\\n[INFECTIOUS DISEASES 199]\\r\\n\\r\\nCold Sponging.--The water may be warm, cool, or ice cold, according to the\\r\\nheight of the fever. A thorough sponge bath should take from fifteen to\\r\\ntwenty minutes. The ice cold sponging is quite as formidable as the full\\r\\ncold bath, for which there is an unsuperable objection in private\\r\\npractice.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bath.--This should be given under the doctor\\'s directions, and I will\\r\\nnot describe it.\\r\\n\\r\\nMedical Treatment.--Little medicine is used in hospital practice. Nursing\\r\\nis the important essential in typhoid fever.\\r\\n\\r\\nManagement of the Convalescent.--An authority writes, My custom has been\\r\\nnot to allow solid food until the temperature has been normal for ten\\r\\ndays. This is, I think, a safe rule, leaning perhaps to the side of\\r\\nextreme caution; but after all with eggs, milk toast, milk puddings, and\\r\\njellies, the patient can take a fairly varied diet. You cannot wait too\\r\\nlong before you give solid foods, particularly meats, They are especially\\r\\ndangerous. The patient may be allowed to sit up for a short time about the\\r\\nend of the first week of convalescence, and the period may be prolonged\\r\\nwith a gradual return of strength. He should move about slowly, and when\\r\\nthe weather is favorable should be in the open air as much as possible.\\r\\nKeep from all excitement. Constipation now should be treated with an\\r\\nenema. A noticeable diarrhea should restrict the diet to milk and the\\r\\npatient be confined to the bed. There are many who cannot have a\\r\\nprofessional nurse. Good nursing is necessary in typhoid fever. Any\\r\\nsensible person who is willing to follow directions can do well. But she\\r\\nmust do as the doctor directs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese are some things you need to do: Look out for bad symptoms; twitching\\r\\nof the tendons, grasping at imaginary things are bad symptoms. Inform the\\r\\ndoctor and soon. Never allow the patient to sit up in bed. The stool must\\r\\nbe passed lying flat and you must place the bed pan without the patient\\'s\\r\\naid. Bleeding may be started by the least exertion. I knew of one woman\\r\\nwho lost her life through necessity of getting up and passing the stool\\r\\nsitting on a chamber. Bleeding came on suddenly, and before the doctor\\r\\ncould get there she was nearly gone. Cough and sudden pain in the lungs\\r\\nneed prompt attention. I dismissed a boy on one Wednesday as convalescent.\\r\\nThat night it became suddenly cold and he became chilled. The mother sent\\r\\nfor me the next day, and we pulled him through pneumonia. Suppose she had\\r\\nwaited another day? She was not that kind of a mother. Your greatest trial\\r\\nwill come in convalescence, when the patient is so hungry. Be careful or\\r\\nyou will kill the patient by kindness. A minister I knew killed himself by\\r\\ngoing against the doctor\\'s orders and eating a hearty dinner. The doctor\\r\\nwas rather profane, and when he went to see the preacher, after the\\r\\nrelapse caused by the dinner, he relieved his mind in no gentle manner.\\r\\nAgain allow no visitors in the sick room or one adjacent. They are an\\r\\nabomination. Many people are killed by well-intentioned ignoramuses. Do\\r\\nnot whisper; the Lord save the patient who has a whisperer for a nurse. I\\r\\ncannot urge too strongly proper nursing in this disease. It is an absolute\\r\\nnecessity. A nurse to be successful must have good sense and also must\\r\\nobey all directions. A diet is a necessity in this disease. The patient\\r\\nmust not move any more than is absolutely necessary for his comfort. He\\r\\nmust never try to help move himself. The muscles of the abdomen must\\r\\nremain lax and quiet. The danger, I think, is in the bowels. The mucous\\r\\ncovering in the interior is inflamed and ulcerated, and there is always\\r\\nsome danger of the ulceration eating through the coating into the blood\\r\\nvessels, causing more or less bleeding and even eating the bowel enough to\\r\\ncause an opening (perforation) and the escape of the bowel contents into\\r\\nthe abdominal cavity causing inflammation of the peritoneum (peritonitis)\\r\\nand almost certain death. Walking typhoid is dangerous for that reason.\\r\\nThe food must be of such nature that it is all digested. It must not leave\\r\\nlumps to press upon the sore places in the bowels causing more trouble\\r\\nthere and more diarrhea.\\r\\n\\r\\n[200 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nTYPHUS FEVER, (Filth Disease).--Typhus fever is an acute, infectious\\r\\ndisease, characterized by a sudden onset, marked nervous symptoms, and\\r\\nspotted rash and fever ending quickly after two weeks. Also called jail,\\r\\ncamp, hospital, or ship fever. Filth has a great deal to do with its\\r\\nproduction. There is no real characteristic symptom except the eruption.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--It generally lasts two weeks. Incubation period of twelve days\\r\\nor less, marked at times by slight weary feeling. The onset is usually\\r\\nsudden, by one chill or several, with high fever, headache, pain in back\\r\\nand legs, prostration, vomiting, and mild and active delirium. Pulse does\\r\\nnot have the double beat, often there is bronchitis.\\r\\n\\r\\nEruption.--\"This appears on the third to fifth day; the fever remaining\\r\\nhigh. During the second week all the symptoms increase and are weakening\\r\\nwith marked delirium and coma vigil\" (unconscious, delirious, but with the\\r\\neyes open). When death occurs it usually comes at the end of the second\\r\\nweek from exhaustion. Favorable cases terminate at this time by crisis;\\r\\nthe prostration is extreme; but convalescence is rapid.\\r\\n\\r\\n[INFECTIOUS DISEASES 201]\\r\\n\\r\\nFever.--Sudden onset to even 104 to 105 degrees; steady rise for four or\\r\\nfive days with slight morning remissions; terminating by crisis on the\\r\\ntwelfth to fourteenth day, falling in some cases below normal; in fatal\\r\\ncases there is a rapid rise to 108 or 109 degrees. The eruption appears on\\r\\nthe abdomen on the third to fifth day.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment like Typhoid.--Mortality, twelve to twenty per cent.\\r\\n\\r\\nSMALLPOX or Variola.--Smallpox is an acute infectious disease. It has a\\r\\nsudden onset with a severe period of invasion which is followed by a\\r\\nfalling of the fever, and then the eruption comes out. This eruption\\r\\nbegins as a pimple, then a watery pimple (vesicle) which runs into the pus\\r\\npimple (pustule) and then the crust or scab forms. The mucous membrane in\\r\\ncontact with the air may also be affected. Almost all persons exposed, if\\r\\nnot vaccinated, are almost invariably attacked. It is very contagious. It\\r\\nattacks all ages, but it is particularly fatal to young children.\\r\\n\\r\\nCause.--An unknown poison in the contents of the pustules or crusts in\\r\\nsecretion and excretion, apparently, and in the exhalations of the lungs\\r\\nand skin; one attack does not always confer immunity for life. It is\\r\\ncontagious from an early period. Direct contact does not seem to be\\r\\nnecessary, for it can be carried by one who does not have it.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--Incubation lasts from ten to fourteen days, and is usually\\r\\nwithout symptoms. Invasion comes suddenly with one or more chills in\\r\\nadults, or convulsions in children, with terrible headache, very severe\\r\\npain in the back and extremities, vomiting, the temperature rising rapidly\\r\\nto 103 or 104 degrees.\\r\\n\\r\\nEruptions.--This usually appears on the fourth day as small red papules on\\r\\nthe forehead, along the line of the hair and on the wrists, spreading\\r\\nwithin twenty-four hours over the face, extremities, trunk and mucous\\r\\nmembrane.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms of fever diminish with the appearance of the rash, which is most\\r\\nmarked on the face and ripens first there. The papules become hollowed\\r\\nvesicles and a clear fluid fills them on the fifth or sixth day. They fill\\r\\nwith pus about the eighth day, and their summits become globular, while\\r\\nthe surrounding skin is red, swollen and painful. The general bodily\\r\\nsymptoms again return and the temperature rises for about twenty-four\\r\\nhours. Drying of the eruption begins the tenth or eleventh day. The\\r\\npustules dry, forming crusts, while the swelling of the skin disappears\\r\\nand the temperature gradually falls. The crusts fall off, leaving scars\\r\\nonly where the true skin has been destroyed.\\r\\n\\r\\nConfluent form.--All the symptoms are more severe. The eruption runs\\r\\ntogether and all the skin is covered.\\r\\n\\r\\nVarioloid.--This is smallpox modified by vaccination. The invasion may be\\r\\nsudden and severe. It is usually mild and gradual, but with severe pain in\\r\\nthe back and head. A scanty eruption of papules, often only on the face\\r\\nand hands, appears on the third or fourth day, with disappearance of\\r\\nconstitutional symptoms.\\r\\n\\r\\n[202 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--Vaccinate the children the second or third month, and all\\r\\npersons about every six years, and always after exposure to the disease or\\r\\nduring epidemics. Put the patient in a room cleared of all furniture,\\r\\ncarpets, curtains, rugs, etc.; keep the patient thoroughly clean, and the\\r\\nlinen should be frequently changed. The bed clothing should be light.\\r\\nDisinfect and sterilize everything thoroughly that has been in contact\\r\\nwith the patient. Get a good experienced nurse, and one who has been\\r\\naround the disease.\\r\\n\\r\\nDiet.--Give the supporting diet early. During the first stage give milk,\\r\\nbroths of different kinds, albumin water. Relieve the intense thirst by\\r\\nwater and lemonade. When the first (initial) fever subsides and the\\r\\npatient feels improved, give milk, eggs, chops, steak, or rare roast meat,\\r\\nbread or toast; vegetables, such as potato, spinach, celery, asparagus\\r\\ntips, cauliflower tops. When the second fever returns go back to the\\r\\nliquid diet again, and give regularly and as much as possible every two or\\r\\nthree hours during the day, and every three or four hours during the\\r\\nnight. Milk, plain or peptonized; milk punch, raw eggs, broths, beef\\r\\njuice. If swallowing is difficult, give food cold and oftener, and in less\\r\\nquantity. Increase the diet rapidly during convalescence.\\r\\n\\r\\nCold drinks should be freely given. Barley water and oatmeal water are\\r\\nnutritious and palatable. Milk broths, and articles that give no trouble\\r\\nto digest.\\r\\n\\r\\nNursing.--Nursing is the main thing. The bowels should be kept open with\\r\\nsalts. There is no special medicine we can claim will do good. Aconite may\\r\\nbe used for the fever at first, in drop doses every hour for twenty-four\\r\\nhours. But the least medicine that is given the better it will generally\\r\\nbe.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is, I believe, something in protecting the ripening papules from the\\r\\nlight. The constant application on the face and hands of lint soaked in\\r\\ncold water, to which antiseptics such as carbolic acid or bichloride may\\r\\nbe added, is perhaps the most suitable treatment. It is very pleasant for\\r\\nthe patient at least, and for the face it is well to make a mask of lint\\r\\nwhich can be covered with oiled silk. When the crusts begin to form, the\\r\\nchief point is to keep them thoroughly moist, which may be done with oil\\r\\nor glycerin; vaselin is particularly useful, and at this stage can be\\r\\nfreely used upon the face. It frequently relieves the itching also. For\\r\\nthe odor, which is sometimes so characteristic and disagreeable, the\\r\\ndiluted carbolic acid solutions are probably the best. If the eruption is\\r\\nabundant on the scalp the hair should be cut short. During, convalescence\\r\\nfrequent bathing is advisable. It should be done daily, using carbolic\\r\\nsoap freely in order to get rid of the crusts and scabs. There is danger\\r\\nto others as long as the skin is not smooth and clean, and not free from\\r\\nany trace of scabs. As you must have a physician, I give but little\\r\\nmedical treatment. Nursing is the main thing in this disease.\\r\\n\\r\\n[INFECTIOUS DISEASES 203]\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral Rules for Disinfection.--The walls, woodwork, and ceiling may be\\r\\ncleaned by washing with one to one thousand solution of corrosive\\r\\nsublimate solution, or a five per cent carbolic acid solution, Or by\\r\\nrubbing with bread if solutions would injure. All dust must be removed.\\r\\nPlastered walls and ceilings may be white-washed. Woodwork must then be\\r\\nscrubbed with soap and thoroughly wiped. Then fumigate, at least three\\r\\npounds of sulphur should be burned in the room for each 1,000 cubic feet\\r\\nof space. Placing it in a pan supported in another containing water to\\r\\nguard against fire. After scrubbing or fumigating, the room and its\\r\\ncontents should be freely aired for several days, admitting sunlight if\\r\\npossible. All useless articles and badly soiled bedding should be burned.\\r\\nSuch pieces of clothing as will not be injured may be boiled or soaked in\\r\\na one to one thousand formaldehyde solution (one ounce of twelve per cent\\r\\nsolution in one gallon of water), or two per cent carbolic acid solution.\\r\\nClothing, bedding, etc., may be disinfected in the steam sterilizer.\\r\\n\\r\\nHands, Body, etc.--Special outer garments may be worn while in the sick\\r\\nroom and removed, and clothing aired before leaving. Hands of the\\r\\nattendant should be washed in one to one thousand corrosive sublimate\\r\\nsolution.\\r\\n\\r\\nVaccination and Re-vaccination and its Prevention of Smallpox. We quote in\\r\\npart from an article prepared by the State of Michigan. It is well known\\r\\nthat smallpox can be prevented or modified by vaccination; and a\\r\\nwidespread epidemic of the disease can be attributed only to an equally\\r\\nwidespread ignorance or willfulness concerning smallpox and its prevention\\r\\nby vaccination and re-vaccination.\\r\\n\\r\\nA Good Time to be Vaccinated.--Smallpox is usually most prevalent in the\\r\\nwinter and spring months, reaching the highest point in May. The rarity of\\r\\nsmallpox in Michigan for several years led to a feeling of security and to\\r\\nneglect vaccination, resulting in an increased proportion of inhabitants\\r\\nnot protected by recent vaccination. This made possible a widespread\\r\\nepidemic. The proper preventive of such an epidemic is general vaccination\\r\\nand re-vaccination of all persons not recently thus protected. There is no\\r\\nbetter settled fact than that vaccination does protect against smallpox.\\r\\nBut after a time the protection is weakened, therefore after a lapse of\\r\\nfive years there should be re-vaccination.\\r\\n\\r\\n[204 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy Vaccinate.--Because vaccination is a preventive of all forms of\\r\\nsmallpox, and because by traveling, or by travelers, by articles received\\r\\nin the mail or from the stores or shops, or other various ways anyone at\\r\\nany time, may, without knowing it, be exposed to smallpox, it becomes\\r\\nimportant so far as possible without injury to health to render every\\r\\nperson incapable of taking the disease. This may be done so perfectly by\\r\\nvaccination and re-vaccination with genuine bovine vaccine virus that no\\r\\nquestion of ordinary expense or trouble should be allowed for a day to\\r\\nprevent the careful vaccination of every man, woman and child in Michigan,\\r\\nand the re-vaccination of every one who has not been vaccinated within\\r\\nfive years. It is well established that those who have been properly\\r\\nvaccinated are far less likely to take smallpox if exposed to it, and that\\r\\nthe very few who have been properly vaccinated and have smallpox have it\\r\\nin a much milder form and are much less disfigured by it than those who\\r\\nhave not been thus vaccinated. The value of vaccination is illustrated by\\r\\nthe following facts: On March the 13th, 1859, Dr. E. M. Snow, of\\r\\nProvidence, R. 1., found in a cluster of seven houses twenty-five\\r\\nfamilies, and in these families ten cases of smallpox, all apparently at\\r\\nabout the same stage of the disease. In the same families there were\\r\\ntwenty-one children, who had never been vaccinated. The ten cases and the\\r\\nremaining members of the families, including the twenty-one children, were\\r\\nquarantined at home, and the children were all vaccinated and compelled to\\r\\nremain with the sick. Several other cases of smallpox occurred in the\\r\\npersons previously exposed, but not one of the twenty-one children\\r\\nreferred to had the slightest touch of the disease.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Sweden, the average number of deaths in each year from smallpox per\\r\\nmillion inhabitants was:\\r\\n\\r\\n  Before the introduction of vaccination          (1774-1801),  1,973;\\r\\n  During the period of optional vaccination       (1802-1816),    479;\\r\\n  And during the period of obligatory vaccination (1817-1877),    189.\\r\\n\\r\\nVaccination was introduced in England near the beginning of the nineteenth\\r\\ncentury, and since 1853 compulsory vaccination has been attempted. In\\r\\nEngland the number of deaths in each year from smallpox per one million\\r\\ninhabitants was:\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the close of the eighteenth century, 3,000.\\r\\n             From 1841 to 1853 (average), 304.\\r\\n             From 1854 to 1863 (average), 171.\\r\\n\\r\\nSmallpox entirely prevented by re-vaccination.--In the Bavarian army re-\\r\\nvaccination has been compulsory since 1843. From that date till 1857, not\\r\\neven a single case of unmodified smallpox occurred, nor a single death\\r\\nfrom smallpox. During the year of duty, Dr. Marson, physician of the\\r\\nLondon Smallpox Hospital, has never observed a single case of smallpox in\\r\\nthe officers and employees of the hospital, who are re-vaccinated when\\r\\nthey enter the service, and who are constantly exposed to the infection.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Out of more than 10,000 children vaccinated at Brussels with animal\\r\\nlymph, from 1865 to 1870, and who went through the terrible epidemic of\\r\\nsmallpox, which in 1870 and 1871 frightened the world, not a single one\\r\\nwas to my knowledge reported as being attacked by  the disease. The same\\r\\nimmunity was shared by those, a much larger number, whom I had\\r\\nre-vaccinated and who at the same time were living in epidemic\\r\\ncenters.\"--Dr. Warlemont, of Brussels.\\r\\n\\r\\n[INFECTIOUS DISEASES 205]\\r\\n\\r\\nWho should be Vaccinated.--Everybody, old and young, for his own interest,\\r\\nand that he may not become a breeding place for the distribution of\\r\\nsmallpox to others, should seek that protection from smallpox which is\\r\\nafforded by vaccination alone. It is believed that all persons except\\r\\nthose mentioned in the following paragraph may, if the operation is\\r\\nproperly performed, at the proper time, and with pure bovine virus, be\\r\\nvaccinated with perfect safety to themselves. Even those who have had\\r\\nsmallpox should be vaccinated, for otherwise they may take the disease;\\r\\nand it seems to be proved that a larger proportion, of those who have\\r\\nsmallpox a second time, die than of those who have the disease after\\r\\nvaccination.\\r\\n\\r\\nWho should not be Vaccinated.--Unless exposure to smallpox is believed to\\r\\nhave taken place or likely to take place, teething children, pregnant\\r\\nwomen, persons suffering from measles, scarlet fever, erysipelas, or\\r\\nsusceptible to and recently exposed to one of these diseases, persons\\r\\nsuffering with skin diseases or eruption, and in general feeble persons\\r\\nnot in good health, should not be vaccinated. In all cases in which there\\r\\nis any doubt as to the propriety of vaccinating or postponing vaccination\\r\\nthe judgment of a good physician should be taken. The restriction, as to\\r\\nvaccinating teething children makes it important that children should be\\r\\nvaccinated before the teething process has begun, because smallpox is very\\r\\nmuch more dangerous than vaccination. Smallpox is exceedingly dangerous to\\r\\npregnant women.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen should a person be Vaccinated.--The sooner the better as a rule, and\\r\\nespecially whenever there is much liability of exposure to smallpox.\\r\\nChildren should be vaccinated before they are four months old; those who\\r\\nhave never been vaccinated, should, except teething children, be\\r\\nvaccinated at once. Because the vaccination often loses its protective\\r\\npower after a time, those who have been vaccinated but once or twice\\r\\nshould, in order to test and to increase the protective power of the\\r\\nformer vaccination, be vaccinated again, and as often as the vaccination\\r\\ncan be made to work. In general, to insure full protection from smallpox,\\r\\none should be vaccinated as often as every five years. It has been found\\r\\nthat of those who have smallpox the proportion of deaths is very much less\\r\\namong those who have three or four good vaccination scars than among those\\r\\nwho have but one scar.\\r\\n\\r\\nVaccination after exposure to Smallpox.--Vaccination as late as the second\\r\\nday after known exposure to smallpox is believed to have prevented the\\r\\nsmallpox; vaccination the third day after exposure has rendered the\\r\\ndisease much milder than usual, and in a case in Iowa, vaccination on the\\r\\nseventh or eighth day after exposure to smallpox ran a partial course and\\r\\nwas believed to have modified the attack of smallpox, which, however, it\\r\\ndid not wholly prevent. A recent case in Michigan was vaccinated three\\r\\ndays after exposure, as were also the wife, mother, and two children, both\\r\\nunder five years of age; all vaccinated again six days after the exposure.\\r\\nThe health officer reported as follows: \"The results were gratifying.\\r\\nDuring the first week of the eruption it was evidently aborting and\\r\\nwithout doubt as the result of vaccination eight days before the eruption.\\r\\nA complete and fine recovery. Certainly an aborted course, with scarcely a\\r\\nmark left, and not another case in the above family, whom necessity\\r\\ncompelled to occupy the same house, the same rooms, continual contact with\\r\\nthe contagion, scores one more big credit mark for vaccination.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n[206 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nWith what should one be Vaccinated.--Because the potency of virus depends\\r\\nlargely upon its being fresh, and it is so easy to obtain pure and fresh\\r\\nbovine virus, and because such bovine virus is efficient it is better in\\r\\nall cases to use only the pure and fresh bovine virus.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhere should Vaccination be Performed.--In a room or place free from\\r\\npersons suffering from disease, and from dust which may convey to the\\r\\nscratched surface germs of any communicable disease; certainly not in or\\r\\nnear a room where there is erysipelas or consumption, nor in the presence\\r\\nof one who has just come from a person sick with erysipelas, diphtheria,\\r\\nor scarlet fever.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy whom should one be Vaccinated.--The operation of vaccination should be\\r\\nperformed always by a competent and responsible physician. To try to\\r\\nvaccinate one\\'s self or one\\'s family is poor economy, for it often results\\r\\nnot only in a waste of money and of time, but in a false and dangerous\\r\\nfeeling of security. To trust to vaccination by nurses and midwives is\\r\\nequally foolish. A well-educated and experienced physician has the skill,\\r\\nand the special knowledge necessary to the best judgment on all of the\\r\\nquestions involved, without which the operation may be a failure or worse\\r\\nthan a failure. In work of this kind the best is the cheapest, whatever it\\r\\ncosts.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Vaccination.--Let the vaccinated place alone. Do not scratch it or\\r\\notherwise transfer the virus where it is not wanted. Protect it by a\\r\\nbandage, or cloth which has been boiled and ironed with a hot iron. Try to\\r\\nkeep the pustule unbroken, as a protection against germs of diseases and\\r\\nagainst unnecessary discomfort. A bad sore arm may not be and probably is\\r\\nnot true vaccination, but may be due to lack of care during and after\\r\\nvaccination to keep out septic germs.\\r\\n\\r\\nCommon appearances after Vaccination.--For a day or two nothing unusual\\r\\nshould appear. A few days after that, if it succeeds regularly, the skin\\r\\nwill become red, then a pimple will form, and on the pimple a little\\r\\nvesicle or blister which may be plainly seen on the fifth or sixth day. On\\r\\nthe eighth day the blister (vesicle) is, or should be, plump, round,\\r\\ntranslucent, pearly white, with a clearly marked edge and a depression in\\r\\nthe center; the skin around it for about half an inch is red and swollen.\\r\\nThis vesicle and the red, inflamed circle about it (called the areola) are\\r\\nthe two points which prove the vaccination to be successful. A rash, and\\r\\neven a vesicular eruption, sometimes comes on the child\\'s body about the\\r\\neighth day, and lasts about a week; he may be feverish, or may remain\\r\\nquite well. The arm may be red and swollen down as far as the elbow, and\\r\\nin the adult there will usually be a tender or swollen gland in the\\r\\narm-pit, and some disturbance of sleep for several nights. The vesicle\\r\\ndries up in a few days more, and a crust forms which becomes of a brownish\\r\\nmahogany color, and falls off from the twentieth to the twenty-fifth day.\\r\\nIn some cases the several appearances described above may be delayed a day\\r\\nor two. The crust or scab will leave a well-marked, permanent scar.\\r\\n\\r\\n[INFECTIOUS DISEASES 207]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat to do during and after Vaccination.--Do nothing to irritate the\\r\\neruption, do not pull the scab off, when it drops off throw it in the\\r\\nfire. When the eruption is at its height show it to the doctor who\\r\\nperformed the vaccination. If it is satisfactory, ask him for a\\r\\ncertificate stating when and by whom you were vaccinated, whether with\\r\\nbovine or humanized lymph, in how many places and with what result at each\\r\\nplace. When the arm is healed, if the vaccination did not work well, be\\r\\nvaccinated again as soon as possible, and in the best manner possible.\\r\\nThis will be a test to the protection secured by the former vaccination,\\r\\nand will itself afford increased protection. Do not be satisfied with less\\r\\nthan four genuine vaccine scars, or with four if it is possible to secure\\r\\nmore than four. This vaccination a second or third time in close\\r\\nsuccession is believed to be hardly less important than vaccination the\\r\\nfirst time, and hardly less valuable as a protection against smallpox.\\r\\nWithout doubt many persons are living in a false sense of security from\\r\\nsmallpox because at some time in their lives they have had a little sore\\r\\non their arm caused by a supposed or real vaccination, or because an\\r\\nimperfect vaccination failed to work, or because they were successfully\\r\\nvaccinated, or had the varioloid, or the unmodified smallpox many years\\r\\nago. Until smallpox is stamped out throughout the world so that exposure\\r\\nof the disease shall be practically impossible, the only personal safety\\r\\nis in such perfect vaccination that one need not fear an exposure to\\r\\nsmallpox through the recklessness of the foolish.\\r\\n\\r\\nMake a record of your Vaccination.--Do not fail to procure and preserve\\r\\nthe certificate mentioned in the preceding paragraph, and also to make a\\r\\npersonal record of the facts with regard to any vaccination of yourself or\\r\\nin your family. From it you may sometime learn that it is ten years since\\r\\nyou or some member of your family was vaccinated, when you thought it only\\r\\nfive.\\r\\n\\r\\nLives saved from smallpox in Michigan.--Since the State Board of Health\\r\\nwas established, many thousands of people in Michigan have been vaccinated\\r\\nbecause of its recommendations; and the statistics of deaths, published by\\r\\nthe Secretary of State, show that at the close of the year 1906, the death\\r\\nrate from smallpox in Michigan had been so much less than before the board\\r\\nwas established as to indicate that over three thousand lives had been\\r\\nsaved from that loathsome disease. The average death rate per year, for\\r\\nthe five years, 1869-1873, before the board was established, was 8.5 per\\r\\n100,000 inhabitants, and since the board was established, for the\\r\\nthirty-three years, 1874-1907, it was only 1.5. Since 1896 an uncommon\\r\\nmild type of the disease has prevailed very extensively, but the death\\r\\nrate has been exceedingly low, being for the eleven years, 1897-1907,\\r\\nslightly less than one death for each 100,000 inhabitants. The great\\r\\nsaving of life from smallpox in civilized countries has been mainly\\r\\nbecause of vaccination and revaccination.\\r\\n\\r\\n[208 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nVACCINATION, Symptoms.--At first a slight irritation at the place of\\r\\nvaccination. The eruption appears on the third or fourth day as a reddish\\r\\npimple surrounded by a reddened surface. On the fifth or sixth day this\\r\\npimple becomes a vesicle with a depressed center and filled with clear\\r\\ncontents. It reaches its greatest size on the eighth day. By the tenth day\\r\\nthe contents are pus-like and the surrounding skin is more inflamed and\\r\\noften quite painful. These symptoms diminish, and by the end of the second\\r\\nweek the pustule has dried to a brownish scab, which falls off between the\\r\\ntwenty-first and twenty-fifth days, and leaves a depressed scar. Fever and\\r\\nmild constitutional symptoms usually go with the eruption and may last\\r\\nuntil about the eighth day.\\r\\n\\r\\nReliable lymph points should always be used. Clean the skin near the\\r\\ninsertion of the deltoid muscle on the arm, and with a clean (sterile)\\r\\nknife or ivory point, a few scratches are made, deep enough to allow a\\r\\nslight flow of liquid, but no bleeding. The vaccine virus moistened, if\\r\\ndried on a point, is rubbed into the wound and allowed to dry. A piece of\\r\\nsterile gauze, or a \"shield,\" is used as a dressing. This shield can be\\r\\nbought at any drug store. One vaccination may give immunity for ten to\\r\\ntwelve years, but it is better to be vaccinated every six years at least.\\r\\n\\r\\nDENGUE. Break-bone Fever, Dandy Fever.--This is an acute infectious\\r\\ndisease characterized by pains in the joints and muscles, fever, an\\r\\ninitial reddish swollen eruption and a terminal eruption of variable type.\\r\\nIt occurs in the tropical regions and the warmer portions of the temperate\\r\\nzone. The disease appears in epidemics, rapidly attacking many persons.\\r\\n\\r\\n[INFECTIOUS DISEASES 209]\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--Incubation lasts from three to five days without any special\\r\\nsymptoms. The onset is marked with chilly feelings, an active fever with\\r\\ntemperature gradually rising. There is severe pain in the muscles and in\\r\\nthe joints which become red and swollen. There is intense pain in the\\r\\neyeballs, head, back and extremities. Face looks flushed, eyes are sunken,\\r\\nthe skin looks flushed and mucous membrane looks red. This is the\\r\\nbeginning rash. The high fever falls quickly after three or four days,\\r\\nsometimes with sweating, diarrhea or nose bleed. The patient feels stiff\\r\\nand sore then, but comparatively well. A slight fever returns after two to\\r\\nfour days, although this sometimes remains absent. Pains and eruptions,\\r\\nlike scarlet fever or hives, appear. An attack usually lasts seven to\\r\\neight days. Convalescence is often long and slow, with stiffness and pain\\r\\nin the joints and muscles and great weakness. A relapse may return within\\r\\ntwo weeks.\\r\\n\\r\\nPHYSICIANS\\' TREATMENT for Dengue.--An anti-plague serum is sometimes used,\\r\\nthough with doubtful results. The pain is controlled by doses of morphine\\r\\nof one-eighth to one-fourth of a grain every four or five hours. Hyoscin,\\r\\none hundredth of a grain, is also given for the pain. The high temperature\\r\\ncan be relieved by cold and tepid sponging. Tonics are given during the\\r\\nconvalescence and continued for some time.\\r\\n\\r\\nCEREBRO-SPINAL MENINGITIS.--This is an acute infectious disease. It comes\\r\\nin epidemics, when there are many cases, or appears here and there as a\\r\\nseparate case (sporadic). It is caused by a specific organism (germ) and\\r\\nthe disease attacks the membranes of the brain and spinal cord.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf late years great progress has been made by patient investigation, and a\\r\\nserum is now prepared for the treatment of this disease. The results of\\r\\nthis treatment are better than the treatments formerly used, and there is\\r\\ngood reason to believe that in a few years this treatment will be as\\r\\neffective in this disease as antitoxin is in diphtheria.\\r\\n\\r\\nCause.--Young adults and children are affected most often. Bad\\r\\nsurroundings and over-exertion are predisposing factors.\\r\\n\\r\\nConditions.--There is congestion of the membranes of the brain and spinal\\r\\ncord which are covered with an exudate confined on the brain, chiefly to\\r\\nthe base.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms. Ordinary Form.--Incubation is of unknown length and occasionally\\r\\nmarked by want of appetite, headache, and pain in the back. The invasion\\r\\nis usually sudden, chill, projectile vomiting, throwing forward, severe\\r\\nheadache, pain and rigidity of the back of the neck, pain in various parts\\r\\nof the body, skin over-sensitive, irritable, and temperature about 102\\r\\ndegrees, with all symptoms of an active fever. Later, pains are very\\r\\nsevere, especially in the head, neck and back; the head is drawn back;\\r\\noften the back is rigid; the muscles of the neck and back are tender and\\r\\nattempts to stretch them cause intense pain. The vomiting now is less\\r\\nprominent. Temperature is extremely irregular, 99 to 105 degrees or more.\\r\\nPulse is slow, often 50 to 60, and full and strong at first. The delirium\\r\\nis of a severe and variable type in common, alternating with partial or\\r\\ncomplete coma, the latter predominating toward the close of fatal attacks.\\r\\nStimulation of nerve centers causes cross-eyed look, drooping of upper\\r\\neyelid, movement of eyeballs unequal, contracted, dilated, or sluggish\\r\\npupils; acute and painful hearing, spasmodic contractions of the muscles\\r\\nfollowed by paralysis of the face muscles, etc. The disease may last\\r\\nseveral hours or several months. Many die within five days. In fatal cases\\r\\nthe patient passes into seemingly deep sleep with symptoms of a very\\r\\nprostrating and weakening fever, and often retention of urine. Mild cases\\r\\noccur with only a little fever, headache, stiff muscles of the neck,\\r\\ndiscomfort in back and extremities. The malignant type occurs epidemically\\r\\nor sporadically.\\r\\n\\r\\n[210 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIEs]\\r\\n\\r\\nMalignant type.--Sudden invasion with severe chills, slight rise in\\r\\ntemperature, pain in the back of the neck, headaches, stupor, muscular\\r\\nspasms, a slow pulse, often purple bleeding, eruption, coma and death\\r\\nwithin hours, rather than days. This is a terrible disease, and a\\r\\nphysician is needed from the first. The death rate varies from twenty to\\r\\nseventy-live per cent. Treatment must be given by a physician. Spinal\\r\\nmeningitis is inflammation of the membrane of the spinal cord along with\\r\\nthe accompanying back and extremity symptoms, while the head remains clear\\r\\nand free from complications.\\r\\n\\r\\nMENINGITIS.--This is an inflammation of the membranes covering the brain\\r\\nalone, and generally commences with fever and severe headaches, with\\r\\navoidance of light and noise as these are painful. In some cases we have\\r\\ndelirium, stupor and coma.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--Treatment must be given by a physician, but cold applications\\r\\nto the head and back are generally good. The bowels also must be kept\\r\\nopen.\\r\\n\\r\\nMENINGITIS. Tubercular, (Basilar Meningitis).--This affection which is\\r\\nalso known as acute hydrocephalus (meaning water on the brain), is\\r\\nessentially an acute tuberculosis in which the membranes of the brain,\\r\\nsometimes of the cord bear the brunt of the attack. It is more common in\\r\\nchildren than in adults. It is more frequent between the second and fifth\\r\\nyears, than in the first year. It is caused by the tubercular infection,\\r\\nand follows the usual course of this disease. Ordinary meningitis is rapid\\r\\nand well defined in its course, with \"high fever,\" severe pains in the\\r\\nhead, intense nervousness, avoidance of light and sound, loss of appetite\\r\\nand constipation. These symptoms are easily understood and are generally\\r\\nclearly read by those around the patient. Unfortunately in tubercular\\r\\nmeningitis the clearly defined symptoms are absent in the beginning, and\\r\\nwhen the physician is called the condition is dangerous. Usually the\\r\\npatient complains but little. There is a slight headache, low fever, no\\r\\nheat in the head, patient is pale most of the time, has little appetite,\\r\\nvomits occasionally and desires to sleep. He is nervous, stupid and lies\\r\\non his side curled up with eyes away from the light. This disease appears\\r\\nmostly in delicate children, who are poor eaters and fond of books;\\r\\nusually in those inheriting poor constitutions. The mortality is very\\r\\nhigh. Parents who have thin, pale sallow children with dainty appetites,\\r\\nwho frequently complain of headaches and are fond of books, should be\\r\\nafraid of infection from tuberculosis and make the little ones live in the\\r\\nopen air and keep away from school. But earlier in the lives of these\\r\\nchildren care must be taken. A child with that pale, thin, sallow,\\r\\ndelicate face and poor body should be fed with the best of food and live\\r\\nin the open air. I once had a family who lost their only two babies\\r\\nthrough this disease. After the first one died I instructed them carefully\\r\\nhow to treat the second child. However, they loved their child foolishly\\r\\nand not wisely and fed it everything it wanted, and you know the children\\r\\ntake an advantage of their parents. Give plenty of good, wholesome\\r\\ndigestible food. Dress them comfortably and warm and keep them out in the\\r\\nopen air. No cakes, candy, peanuts or any food that is not nourishing and\\r\\neasy to digest.\\r\\n\\r\\n[INFECTIOUS DISEASES 211]\\r\\n\\r\\nTUBERCULOSIS. (CONSUMPTION).--Tuberculosis is an infectious disease caused\\r\\nby the bacillus, tuberculosis, and characterized by the formation of\\r\\nnodules or diffuse masses of new tissue. Man, fowls and cows are chiefly\\r\\naffected.\\r\\n\\r\\nIndians, negroes and Irish are very susceptible. The disease is less\\r\\ncommon at great altitudes. Dark, poorly ventilated rooms, such as\\r\\ntenements and factories and the crowding of cities favors infection, as do\\r\\nin-door life and occupations in which dust must be inhaled. Certain\\r\\ninfections such as measles, whooping-cough, chronic heart, kidney and\\r\\nliver diseases and inflammation of the air tract are predisposing factors.\\r\\nInhalation is the chief mode of transmission. Hereditary transmission is\\r\\nrare.\\r\\n\\r\\nForms. The Lungs.--Consumption. This is caused by a germ. Some have the\\r\\nform called galloping consumption. This person is attacked suddenly,\\r\\nwastes away and dies, in a very short time. There is rapid loss of\\r\\nstrength and weight, high fever, night sweats, fast breathing, pains in\\r\\nthe chest, cough and profuse expectoration, and rapid loss of strength.\\r\\n\\r\\nOrdinary Consumption.--Begins slowly and the patient is not aware of the\\r\\ndanger. He may have loss of appetite, dyspepsia, diarrhea and distress\\r\\nafter meals. He looks pale, is weak and loses flesh. Soon he has a hacking\\r\\ncough, worse in the morning, with a scanty, glairy sputum. His weight\\r\\ncontinues to decrease, his heart is weak and beats faster. He has pain in\\r\\nhis chest below the shoulder blades. He may have a slight bleeding from\\r\\nthe lungs. His cough becomes worse, the expectoration gets thicker and\\r\\nmore profuse, with night sweats, high fever, and shortness of breath. The\\r\\neyes are bright; the cheeks are pale or flushed. Chronic looseness of the\\r\\nbowels may be present. Bleeding from the lungs may occur at any time, but\\r\\nit is most frequent and profuse during the last stages. The patient\\r\\nbecomes very weak, thin and pale, emaciated. The brain action remains\\r\\ngood, and he remains hopeful almost until the last. Tuberculosis may exist\\r\\nin almost every part of the body and we have many forms. It is not\\r\\nnecessary to discuss all. It would tend to confusion. I will name the most\\r\\nof them:\\r\\n\\r\\n  1. Acute Miliary Tuberculosis.\\r\\n    (A.) Acute General Miliary Tuberculosis.\\r\\n    (B.) Pulmonary (lung) type.\\r\\n    (C.) Tubercular Meningitis.\\r\\n\\r\\n  2. Tuberculosis of the lymph nodes (glands). This was formerly called\\r\\n  Scrofula. This is more curable and will be treated more fully elsewhere.\\r\\n\\r\\n  3. Tuberculous Pleurisy.\\r\\n\\r\\n  4. Tuberculous Pericarditis.\\r\\n\\r\\n  5. Tuberculous Peritonitis. (Of this there are a good many cases.)\\r\\n\\r\\n  6. Tuberculosis of the Larynx.\\r\\n\\r\\n  7. Acute Pneumonia (Pulmonary Tuberculosis) or \"Galloping Consumption.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n  8. Chronic Ulcerative Pulmonary Tuberculosis.\\r\\n\\r\\n  9. Chronic Miliary Tuberculosis.\\r\\n\\r\\n  10. Tuberculosis of the Alimentary Canal.\\r\\n\\r\\n  11. Tuberculosis of the Brain.\\r\\n\\r\\n  12. Tuberculosis of the liver, kidneys, bladder, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\n  13. Tuberculosis of joints, this will be treated more fully elsewhere.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[212 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nCERVICAL, TUBERCULOSIS (Scrofula).--This is common in children that are\\r\\nnot well nourished, living in badly ventilated and crowded houses, and in\\r\\nthe negroes. Chronic catarrh of the nose and throat and tonsilitis\\r\\npredispose to it. The glands under the lower jaw are usually the first\\r\\ninvolved. They are enlarged, smooth, firm and often become matted\\r\\ntogether. Later the skin may adhere to them and suppuration occurs, that\\r\\nis, pus forms. An abscess results that breaks through the skin and leaves\\r\\na nasty looking sore or scar. The glands in the back of the neck may\\r\\nenlarge also; or in the arm pit or under the collar bone and also the\\r\\nbronchial glands. There is usually secondary anemia. A long course and\\r\\nspontaneous recovery are common. Lung or general miliary tuberculosis may\\r\\noccur.\\r\\n\\r\\nMesenteric Kind.--Symptoms are loss of flesh and strength, anemia,\\r\\ndistended abdomen (pot-belly) and bloated, with offensive diarrhea.\\r\\n\\r\\nMOTHERS\\' REMEDIES.--1. Consumption, Simple Home Method to Break up.--\"A\\r\\ncloth saturated with kerosene oil, bound around the chest at night and\\r\\nfrequently repeated, will remove lung soreness, and it may be taken\\r\\ninwardly with advantages, eight to ten drops three or four times a day in\\r\\nsarsaparilla. It has been tried efficaciously as a cure for consumption.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Consumption, Physicians\\' Remedy for.--\\r\\n\\r\\n      Arsenic Acid           1 part\\r\\n      Carbonate of Potash    2 parts\\r\\n      Cinnamyllic Acid       3 parts\\r\\n\\r\\nHeat this until a perfect solution is obtained, then add twenty-five parts\\r\\ncognac and three parts of watery extract of opium which has been dissolved\\r\\nin twenty-five parts of water filtered. Dose:--At first take six drops\\r\\nafter dinner and supper, gradually increasing to twenty-two drops. Mild\\r\\ncases are cured in two months, but the severe cases may require a year or\\r\\ntwo. This treatment should be given under the care of a physician, as it\\r\\nis poisonous and needs close watching.\\r\\n\\r\\n[INFECTIOUS DISEASES 213]\\r\\n\\r\\nPHYSICIANS\\' TREATMENT for Consumption.--Tuberculous peritonitis is often\\r\\npresent. General better hygienic measures; fresh air, nourishing food;\\r\\ncod-liver oil. The glands are now often cut.\\r\\n\\r\\nSanitary Care. Prevention of Tuberculosis.--The sputum of consumptives\\r\\nshould be carefully collected and destroyed. Patients should be urged not\\r\\nto spit about carelessly, but always use a spit cup and never swallow the\\r\\nsputum. The destruction of the sputum of consumptives should be a routine\\r\\nmeasure in both hospitals and private practice. Thorough boiling or\\r\\nputting in the fire is sufficient. It should be explained to the patient\\r\\nthat the only risk, practically is from this source.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe chances of infection are greatest in young children. The nursing and\\r\\ncare of consumptives involves very slight risks indeed, if proper\\r\\nprecautions are taken.\\r\\n\\r\\nSecond.--A second important measure, relates to the inspection of dairies\\r\\nand slaughter houses. The possibility of the transmission of tuberculosis\\r\\nby infected milk has been fully demonstrated, and in the interest of\\r\\nhealth, the state should take measures to stamp out tuberculosis in\\r\\ncattle.\\r\\n\\r\\nIndividual Prevention.--A mother with pulmonary tuberculosis should not\\r\\nnurse her child. An infant born of tuberculosis parents or of a family in\\r\\nwhich consumption prevails, should be brought up with the greatest care\\r\\nand guarded most particularly against catarrhal affections of all kinds.\\r\\nSpecial attention should be given to the throat and nose, and on the first\\r\\nindication of mouth breathing or any affection of the nose, a careful\\r\\nexamination should be made for adenoids. The child should be clothed in\\r\\nflannel, and live in the open air as much as possible, avoiding close\\r\\nrooms. It is a good practice to sponge the throat and chest night and\\r\\nmorning with cold water. Special attention should be paid to the diet and\\r\\nto the mode of feeding. The meals should be given at regular hours, and\\r\\nthe food plain and substantial. From the onset the child should be\\r\\nencouraged to drink freely of milk. Unfortunately in these cases there\\r\\nseems to be an uncontrollable aversion to fats of all kinds. As the child\\r\\ngrows older, systematically regulated exercise or a course of pulmonary\\r\\n(lung) gymnastics may be taken. In the choice of an occupation, preference\\r\\nshould be given to an out of door life. Families with a predisposition to\\r\\ntuberculosis should, if possible, reside in an equable climate. It would\\r\\nbe best for a young person belonging to such a family to remove to\\r\\nColorado or Southern California, or to some other suitable climate before\\r\\ntrouble begins. The trifling ailments of children should be carefully\\r\\nwatched. In convalescence from fevers, which so frequently prove\\r\\ndangerous, the greatest care should be exercised to prevent from catching\\r\\ncold. Cod-liver oil, the syrup of iodide of iron and arsenic may be given.\\r\\nEnlarged tonsils should be removed. \"The spontaneous healing of local\\r\\ntuberculosis is an every-day affair. Many cases of adenitis (inflammation\\r\\nof the glands) and disease of the bone or joints terminate favorably. The\\r\\nhealing of pulmonary (lung) tuberculosis is shown clinically by the\\r\\nrecovery of patients in whose sputa elastic tissue and bacilli have been\\r\\nfound.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n[214 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral Measures.--The cure of tuberculosis is a question of nutrition;\\r\\ndigestion and assimilation control the situation; make a patient grow fat,\\r\\nand the local disease may be left to take care of itself. There are three\\r\\nindications:\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst, to place the patient in surroundings most favorable for the\\r\\ngreatest degree of nutrition; second, to take such measures as in a local\\r\\nand general way influence the tuberculosis process; third, to alleviate\\r\\nthe symptoms. This is effected by the open air treatment with the\\r\\nnecessary feeding and nursing.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt Home.--In the majority of cases patients must be treated at home. In\\r\\nthe city it has many disadvantages. The patient\\'s bed should be in a room\\r\\nwhere he can have plenty of sunshine and air. Two things are\\r\\nessential--plenty of fresh air and sunshine. While there is fever he\\r\\nshould be at rest in bed. For the greater part of each day, unless the\\r\\nweather is blustering and raining, the windows should be open. On the\\r\\nbright days he can sit out-doors on a balcony or porch, in a reclining\\r\\nchair. He must be in the open air all that is possible to be. A great many\\r\\npatients spend most of the time out in the open air now. In the country\\r\\nplaces this can be easily carried out. In the summer he should be out of\\r\\ndoors from eleven to twelve hours; in the winter six to eight at least. At\\r\\nnight the room should be cool and thoroughly ventilated. \"In the early\\r\\nstages of the disease with much fever, it may require several months of\\r\\nthis rest treatment to the open air before the temperature falls to\\r\\nnormal.\" The sputum is dangerous when it becomes dry. As long as sputum is\\r\\nmoist the germs are held in the sputum; but when it is dry they are\\r\\nreleased and roam at will in the atmosphere and are inhaled. They are then\\r\\nready to lodge themselves in suitable soil. Always keep the sputum\\r\\n(expectoration) moist, and then there is no danger.\\r\\n\\r\\nDiet. Treatment.--The outlook in this disease depends upon the digestion.\\r\\nNausea and loss of appetite are serious obstacles. Many patients loathe\\r\\nfoods of all kinds. A change of air or a sea voyage may promptly restore\\r\\nthe appetite. When this is not possible, rest the patient, keep in the\\r\\nopen air nearly all day and feed regularly with small quantities either of\\r\\nbuttermilk, milk, or kumiss, alternating if necessary with meat juice and\\r\\negg albumin. Some cases which are disturbed by eggs and milk do well on\\r\\nkumiss. Raw eggs are very suitable for feeding, and may be taken between\\r\\nmeals, beginning with one three times a day, and can be increased to two\\r\\nand three at a time. It is hard to give a regular diet. The patient should\\r\\nbe under the care of a physician who will regulate the kind of diet,\\r\\namount and change. When the digestion is good there is less trouble in\\r\\nfeeding. Then the patient can eat meat, poultry, game, oysters, fish,\\r\\nanimal broths, eggs. Nothing should be fried. Avoid pork, veal, hot bread,\\r\\ncakes, pies, sweet meats, rich gravies, crabs, lobsters.\\r\\n\\r\\n[INFECTIOUS DISEASES 215]\\r\\n\\r\\nDiet in Tuberculosis furnished us by a Hospital.--\\r\\n\\r\\nMay Take.--Soups.--Turtle or oyster soup, mutton, clam, or chicken broth,\\r\\npuree of barley, rice, peas, beans, cream of celery or tomatoes, whole\\r\\nbeef tea; peptonized milk, gruel.\\r\\n\\r\\nFish.--All kinds of fresh fish boiled or broiled, oysters or clams, raw,\\r\\nroasted or broiled.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeats.--Rare roast beef or mutton, lamb chops, ham, fat bacon.\\r\\nsweetbreads, poultry, game, tender steaks, hamburger steak rare.\\r\\n\\r\\nEggs.--Every way except fried.\\r\\n\\r\\nFarinaceous.--Oatmeal, wheaten grits, mush, hominy, rice, whole wheat\\r\\nbread, corn bread, milk toast, biscuits, muffins, gems.\\r\\n\\r\\nVegetables.--Potatoes baked, boiled, or creamed, string beans, spinach,\\r\\nonions, asparagus, tomatoes, green peas, all well cooked, cresses,\\r\\nlettuce, plain or with oil dressing, celery.\\r\\n\\r\\nDesserts.--Farina, sago, tapioca, apple or milk pudding, floating island,\\r\\ncustards, baked or stewed apples with fresh cream, cooked fruits, rice\\r\\nwith fresh cream.\\r\\n\\r\\nDrinks.--Fresh milk, cool, warm, or peptonized, cocoa, chocolate,\\r\\nbuttermilk, pure water, tea, coffee, panopepton.\\r\\n\\r\\nMust Not Take.--Fried foods, salt fish, hashes, gravies, veal, pork,\\r\\ncarrots, parsnips, cabbage, beets, turnips, cucumbers, macaroni,\\r\\nspaghetti, sweets, pies, pastry, sweet wines.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWHAT EVERY PERSON SHOULD KNOW ABOUT TUBERCULOSIS,\\r\\nWHETHER HE HAS THE DISEASE OR NOT.\\r\\n\\r\\nTuberculosis is caused by a germ.\\r\\n\\r\\nTuberculosis is communicable and preventable.\\r\\n\\r\\nConsumption of the lungs is the most common form of tuberculosis.\\r\\n\\r\\nConsumption of the bowels is the next most common form.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe germ causing tuberculosis leaves the body of the person who has the\\r\\ndisease by means of the discharges; by the sputum coughed up from the\\r\\nlungs, by nasal discharge, by bowel excrement, by urine, by abscesses.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the sputum of the consumptive is allowed to dry, its infected dust\\r\\nfloats in the air, and is breathed into the lungs.\\r\\n\\r\\n[216 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nAny person breathing such air is in danger of contracting tuberculosis. It\\r\\nis best not to stand near a person suffering with tuberculosis who is\\r\\ncoughing, because in this act finely divided droplets of saliva are thrown\\r\\nfrom the mouth, and may be carried for a distance of three feet. These may\\r\\ncontain large numbers of the bacilli. They are also sometimes thrown out\\r\\nin forcible speaking. The ordinary breath of a consumptive does not\\r\\ncontain them.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the bowels or other discharges from the tuberculous person are not\\r\\ndisinfected, but are thrown into a sewer, privy, river or buried they are\\r\\na source of danger, and may pollute a source of drinking water.\\r\\n\\r\\nImpure milk, that is, milk from a tuberculous cow or milk exposed to\\r\\ninfected dust is a common source of tuberculosis. Milk from suspected\\r\\nsources should be boiled. The all-important thing to do to prevent\\r\\ntuberculosis from spreading from one person to another, and from one part\\r\\nof the body to another, is immediately to destroy all discharges from the\\r\\nbody of a person who has tuberculosis.\\r\\n\\r\\nDestroy by fire or by disinfectant all sputum, all nasal discharges, all\\r\\nbowel excrement, all urine as soon as discharged. For such a purpose use a\\r\\nfive per cent solution of carbolic acid (six and three-fourths ounces of\\r\\ncarbolic acid to one gallon of water).\\r\\n\\r\\nNo person, well or sick, should spit in public places or where the sputum\\r\\ncannot be collected and destroyed.\\r\\n\\r\\nFlies carry sputum and its infection to food, to your hands, your face,\\r\\nclothes, the baby\\'s bottle, from which the germs are taken into the mouth,\\r\\nand thus gain access to the stomach or lungs.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpitting on the sidewalk, on the floor, on the wall, on the grass, in the\\r\\ngutter, or even into a cuspidor containing no disinfectant is a very\\r\\ndangerous practice for a consumptive to indulge.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe person infected with tuberculosis should protect himself, his family,\\r\\nhis associates and the public by not spitting in public places, and by\\r\\npromptly destroying all discharges.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe well person should defend himself by insisting that the tuberculous\\r\\nperson shall destroy all discharges.\\r\\n\\r\\nWell persons should set the example of restraint and themselves refrain\\r\\nfrom spitting promiscuously. A person may appear quite healthy and yet be\\r\\ndeveloping tuberculosis without knowing it.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch a person, if he spits where he pleases, may be depositing infected\\r\\nsputum where it can endanger the health and lives of other persons.\\r\\n\\r\\nDo not sleep with a person who has tuberculosis, nor in the room occupied\\r\\nby a tuberculous person, until that room has been thoroughly disinfected.\\r\\n\\r\\n[INFECTIOUS DISEASES 217]\\r\\n\\r\\nAny person is liable to contract tuberculosis, whether he is well or not.\\r\\nSickly persons, or those having bad colds, influenza bronchitis or\\r\\npneumonia or any general weakness are much more liable to contract\\r\\ntuberculosis than a perfectly well or robust person. If you have a cough\\r\\nthat hangs on consult at once a reliable physician who has ability to\\r\\ndiagnose tuberculosis.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrevention is possible; it is cheaper and easier than cure.\\r\\n\\r\\nAny person having tuberculosis can recover from the disease if he takes\\r\\nthe proper course in time.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdvanced cases of tuberculosis, that is, those cases where the disease is\\r\\nwell developed, are the most dangerous to the public and the most\\r\\ndifficult to cure.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery advanced case of tuberculosis should be in a sanatorium.\\r\\n\\r\\nSanatoria offers the best chance, usually the only chance, of cure to an\\r\\nadvanced case.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey also protect well citizens from danger of infection from advanced\\r\\nstages of tuberculosis. There are fewer deaths from tuberculosis in those\\r\\nlocalities where sanatoria are established for the care of tuberculous\\r\\npersons.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne person out of every seven who die, dies from tuberculosis.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne child out of every ten dies from tuberculosis.\\r\\n\\r\\nHomes and school-houses greatly need more fresh air supplied to their\\r\\noccupants.\\r\\n\\r\\nDay camps are city parks, vacant lots or abandoned farms where the\\r\\ntuberculous persons of a community may go and spend the entire day in\\r\\nrest, receiving instructions in proper hygiene and skillful treatment.\\r\\nSuch camps are supplied with tents, hammocks, reclining chairs, one or\\r\\nmore nurses, milk, eggs and other nourishment.\\r\\n\\r\\nDispensaries are centers of sanitary and medical instruction for local\\r\\ntuberculous persons.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery locality should establish and maintain a dispensary for the benefit\\r\\nof tuberculous persons; for their instruction how to prevent the disease\\r\\nfrom spreading, and how to conduct themselves to insure relief and cure.\\r\\n\\r\\nHouseholders are required by law to report a case within their households\\r\\nto the local health officers. The local health officer has certain duties\\r\\nto perform under the law, and co-operation with him by the householder and\\r\\ntuberculous person, works for the suppression of this disease.\\r\\n\\r\\nDo not consider a tuberculous person an outcast, or one fit for the\\r\\npesthouse. Your crusade is against tuberculosis, not against the person\\r\\nsuffering from the disease.\\r\\n\\r\\nGive the freedom of a well person to the tuberculous who is instructed and\\r\\nconscientious in the observance of necessary precautions. Be very much\\r\\nafraid of the tuberculous person who is ignorant or careless in the\\r\\nobservance of necessary precautions.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[218 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nPNEUMONIA (Lobar) Lung Fever.--Inflammation of the lungs. This is an acute\\r\\ninfectious disease characterized by an exudative inflammation of one or\\r\\nmore lobes of the lungs, with constitutional symptoms due to the\\r\\nabsorption of toxins (poison), the fever terminating by crisis (suddenly).\\r\\nIn speaking of pneumonia you frequently hear the expression \"the lungs are\\r\\nfilling up.\" This is the real condition. The structures surrounding the\\r\\nair cells are inflamed and from the inflamed tissues a secretion exudate\\r\\nis poured out into the cells. This is expectorated, thrown out, by\\r\\ncoughing; but it is poured out into the cells faster than it can be spit\\r\\nup and consequently it remains in some of the cells and fills them up.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe air does not get into such cells and they fill, with many others, and\\r\\nmake that section solid. When the patient is improving he keeps on\\r\\nspitting this up, until all is out and the air cells resume their normal\\r\\nwork. Sometimes they remain so and we have chronic pneumonia.\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses of Pneumonia.--Pneumonia occurs frequently as a complication of\\r\\nother diseases, such as typhoid fever and measles. Yet the majority of\\r\\ncases occur spontaneously. Many times the disease seems to be induced by\\r\\nexposure to the cold, and there can be no doubt that such exposure does at\\r\\nleast promote the development of this affection. It seems, however,\\r\\nprobable that there is some special cause behind it without which the\\r\\nexposure to cold is not sufficient to induce this disease. Pneumonia may\\r\\noccur at any period of life, and is more common among males than females.\\r\\nIt occurs over the entire United States, oftener in the southern and\\r\\nmiddle, than in the Northern States; it is more frequently met with during\\r\\nthe winter and spring months than at other times in the year.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--The onset is usually abrupt with a severe chill and chills\\r\\nlasting from fifteen minutes to an hour, with the temperature suddenly\\r\\nrising and an active fever. There is usually intense pain in a few hours,\\r\\ngenerally in the lower part of the front of the chest, made worse by\\r\\nbreathing and coughing. The patient lies on the affected side so as to\\r\\ngive all chance for the other lung to work, cheeks are flushed, with\\r\\nanxious expression; the wings of the nostrils move in and out with each\\r\\nbreath. The cough is short, dry and painful. Rapid, shallow, jerky\\r\\nbreathing, increasing to difficult breathing. On the first day the\\r\\ncharacteristic expectoration mixed with blood appears (called rusty).\\r\\nPulse runs from 100 to 116, full bounding, but may be feeble and small in\\r\\nserious cases. After three or four days the pain disappears, the\\r\\ntemperature keeps to 104 or 105, but falls quickly the seventh, fifth,\\r\\neighth, sixth and ninth day in this order of frequency. In a few hours,\\r\\nusually twelve, the temperature falls to normal or below, usually with\\r\\nprofuse sweating and with quick relief to all symptoms. This relief from\\r\\ndistressing symptoms is, of course, a time of rejoicing to both patient\\r\\nand friends and the patient and nurse may feel inclined to relax a little\\r\\nfrom the strict observance of rules followed up to this time. Do not,\\r\\nunder any circumstances, yield to such folly. Keep patient properly\\r\\ncovered, as he is weak from the strain and the pores are open.\\r\\n\\r\\n[INFECTIOUS DISEASES 219]\\r\\n\\r\\nConvalescence is usually rapid. A prolonged rise of temperature after the\\r\\ncrisis may be regarded as a relapse. Death may occur at any time after the\\r\\nthird day from sudden heart failure, or from complications such as\\r\\npleurisy, nephritis, meningitis, pericarditis, endocarditis, gangrene of\\r\\nthe lungs.\\r\\n\\r\\nMOTHERS\\' REMEDIES.--1. Lungs, Salt Pork for Inflammation of.--\"Salt pork\\r\\ndipped in hot water, then covered thick with black pepper. Heat in the\\r\\noven and lay or bind on the throat and lungs.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Lungs, Raspberry Tincture for Inflammation of.--\"Take one-half pound of\\r\\nhoney, one cup water; let these boil; take off the scum; pour boiling hot\\r\\nupon one-half ounce lobelia herb and one-half ounce cloves; mix well, then\\r\\nstrain and add one gill of raspberry vinegar. Take from one teaspoonful to\\r\\na dessertspoonful four times a day. Pleasant to take.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n3.

Heat it\\r\\nthrough thoroughly with hot cloths. If used thoroughly and the cold is\\r\\ntaken in time will prevent pneumonia.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Lungs, Mullein for Congestion.--\"The mullein leaves may be purchased at\\r\\nany drug store or gathered in the fields. Make a tea of the leaves by\\r\\nsteeping them. Add enough water to one tablespoon mullein to make a pint,\\r\\nwhich will be three doses, taken three times a day.\" This is a very good\\r\\nremedy.\\r\\n\\r\\n5.

This will cause the blood to\\r\\nleave the congested lung and return to the full regular circulation. By\\r\\ndoing this, you not only relieve the congested lung, but also the pain. If\\r\\nthe patient is stout and strong, give him the \"corn sweat\" under La Grippe\\r\\n(see index); or you can put bottles of hot water about the patient. Use\\r\\nfruit jars, wrap cloths around them so that you will not burn the patient.\\r\\nAlways put one to the feet. If you have a rubber water bag, fill that and\\r\\nput it to his affected side over the pain. After you get him into a sweat\\r\\nyou can remove a little, of the sweating remedy at a time and when all are\\r\\nremoved give him a tepid water sponging. By this time the physician will\\r\\nbe at hand. If you give medicine you can put fifteen drops of the Tincture\\r\\nof Aconite in a glass one-half full of water and give two teaspoonfuls of\\r\\nthis every fifteen minutes for four doses. Then give it every one-half\\r\\nhour. Water can be given often, but in small quantities; plain milk alone,\\r\\nor diluted, or beaten with eggs will make a good diet and keep up the\\r\\nstrength.\\r\\n\\r\\nFomentations.--Cloths wrung out of hot hop tea are often applied to the\\r\\naffected part with good effect. Be careful about wetting the patient.\\r\\nFlaxseed poultices are used.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf used they must be moist and hot. Some doctors are opposed to them. An\\r\\nantiphlogistine poultice is good. Apply it hot. For children you can\\r\\ngrease the whole side of the chest, back and front, with camphor and lard\\r\\nand put over that an absorbent cotton jacket. In the early life of the\\r\\ncountry, home treatment was necessary. Men and women were posted on herbs,\\r\\netc. Teas made of them were freely and successfully used. A great mistake\\r\\nmade was the indiscriminate use of lobelia in too large doses. We have\\r\\nlearned that the hot herb drinks in proper doses are of help. Teas made of\\r\\nboneset, hoarhound, pennyroyal, ginger, catnip, hops, slippery elm, etc.,\\r\\nwere good and are now. They produced the desired result--sweating--and\\r\\nrelieved the congestion of the internal organs and re-established the\\r\\nexternal or (peripheral) circulation. So in the home treatment of\\r\\npneumonia, etc., if you are so situated that you cannot get a physician\\r\\nuse teas internally for sweating, fomentations upon the painful part and\\r\\nif done properly and not too excessively, they will accomplish the desired\\r\\nresult. With the corn sweat, I have saved many lives.\\r\\n\\r\\nERYSIPELAS.--Erysipelas is an infectious disease, and it is usually caused\\r\\nby a germ which we call \"streptococcus pyogenes.\" The disease shows itself\\r\\nby its local symptoms, pain, swelling, etc., and also by general or\\r\\nconstitutional symptoms such as fever, headache, etc., as hereafter given.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses.--It is a disease that occurs at any time, and is sometimes\\r\\nepidemic, that is, attacks many persons at a time, like La Grippe. It\\r\\noccurs more often in the spring; it is contagious, and can be carried by a\\r\\nthird person or in bedding, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--The type that appears upon the face is the most common. The\\r\\nincubation lasts from three to seven days and it usually comes suddenly\\r\\nwith a chill, followed by an active fever and with the local inflammation.\\r\\nIn some cases the local condition appears first. There is at first\\r\\nredness, usually of the bridge of the nose and it rapidly spreads to the\\r\\ncheeks, eyes, ears, etc. It is red, shiny hot, drawing, but with a\\r\\ndistinct margin at its edges, showing how much skin is inflamed. It may\\r\\ntake the form of vesicles. The eyelids may be so swollen as to close, the\\r\\nface and scalp greatly swollen with watery swelling of the eyelids, lips,\\r\\neyes, ears, etc. The glands under the jaw may become enlarged. The general\\r\\nor constitutional symptoms may be severe. The fever may rise to 104 to 106\\r\\nand terminates suddenly. The parts that were first affected become pale\\r\\nand more normal, as other parts are involved. It occurs also on other\\r\\nparts of the body. A sting of an insect sometimes looks like it at first;\\r\\nbut it does not spread like erysipelas. It seems to me to be more\\r\\ndangerous around the head.\\r\\n\\r\\n[INFECTIOUS DISEASES 221]\\r\\n\\r\\nMOTHERS\\' REMEDIES. 1. Erysipelas, Slippery Elm Bark for.--\"Slippery elm\\r\\nused as a wash and taken as a drink.\" Slippery elm is a very good remedy\\r\\nfor this on account of its soothing effect to the affected parts. It is\\r\\nvery good to take internally, as it cleanses the system by acting on the\\r\\nbowels and kidneys.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Erysipelas, Bean Poultices for.--\"White navy beans boiled soft and\\r\\napplied as a poultice to the affected parts and renewed frequently is a\\r\\nsure cure for erysipelas if taken in time.\" This is a very good and\\r\\neffective poultice, but care should be taken not to use it too long, as\\r\\nthe parts will become too soft and might slough.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Erysipelas, Soda Wash for.--\"Put about a tablespoonful of baking soda\\r\\nin one pint of water and bathe parts several times a day,\" This is an\\r\\nextremely simple remedy for such a serious disease, but has been known to\\r\\ndo good in many cases. The baking soda is soothing.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Erysipelas, Easy Remedy for.--\"Keep parts well bathed with\\r\\nwitch-hazel.\" A good preparation should be bought. By applying this freely\\r\\nto the affected parts it will be found to have a very soothing effect.\\r\\n\\r\\n5. Erysipelas, Copperas Liniment for.--\"A few cents\\' worth of common\\r\\ncopperas. Make a solution and keep applying it. This kills the poison as\\r\\nit comes on and relieves the pain. I knew of a very bad case to be cured\\r\\nby this treatment.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n6. Erysipelas, Cranberry Poultice for.--\"Take cranberries and stew them\\r\\nand make a poultice of them.\" This is a remedy that cannot be beaten for\\r\\nthis disease. It gives relief in a very short time and saves the patient a\\r\\ngreat deal of suffering. If the whisky is used to wet the poultice it is\\r\\nmuch better, as it keeps the poultice moist longer. All that is necessary\\r\\nis simply to put on more whiskey and it will not be necessary to change\\r\\nthe poultice so often.\\r\\n\\r\\nPHYSICIANS\\' TREATMENT for Erysipelas.--It is best to separate the patient\\r\\nfrom the others in the family. Some people very easily take this disease.\\r\\nI know one who cannot be in the room where such a patient is for even five\\r\\nminutes without contracting it.\\r\\n\\r\\nLocal Treatment.--1. Wash the parts with a solution of boric acid,\\r\\none-half teaspoonful to eight teaspoonfuls of tepid water, put this on the\\r\\ninflamed parts. Then apply a poultice of bruised cranberries. Wash the\\r\\nface each time with the solution before applying the cranberry poultice\\r\\nafresh.\\r\\n\\r\\n[222 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Paint thoroughly with tincture of iodine outside of the margin of the\\r\\ndisease where the skin shows no sign of the trouble. This is very\\r\\neffective. If done freely it produces a slight inflammation. The stain\\r\\nmade by it remains for some time and that is the objection to it on the\\r\\nface, but do not hesitate on that account if the other remedies do not\\r\\nwork well or are not at hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. The following is a splendid local application.--Cleanse thoroughly the\\r\\ninflamed part with pure castile soap and water, and then wash this off\\r\\nwith one to one thousand corrosive sublimate solution. Dry the skin with a\\r\\nsoft towel and apply a thick coating of equal parts of Ichthyol and\\r\\nvaselin, and over this place antiseptic gauze or sterilized absorbent\\r\\ncotton. Keep this in place with adhesive straps. If the diseased surface\\r\\nis small it may not be necessary to use the gauze, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Tincture Chloride of Iron in dose of ten to twenty drops and more if\\r\\nnecessary four times a day, well diluted with water. This is very hard on\\r\\nthe teeth and should be taken through a glass tube.\\r\\n\\r\\nDiet.--Milk, broths, etc., liquid diet or foods. (See Nursing Dept. under\\r\\nliquid diet.)\\r\\n\\r\\nNursing.--When you nurse any infectious patient, you must be not only\\r\\ncareful of your patient, but of yourself. It is not necessary in order to\\r\\ndo good nursing to endanger yourself; and a nurse who does not know how to\\r\\ncare for herself, cannot successfully nurse the sick. In erysipelas I\\r\\nalways watch the eruption closely. Sometimes it recedes, and the patient,\\r\\nof course, is worse. Then there are some people who believe in \"pow-\\r\\nwowing.\" They have that done and then do not take care of themselves. I\\r\\nhave attended such cases. One case was especially striking. The \"pow-wow\"\\r\\nperson did his work and then the patient thought himself well and\\r\\nproceeded to enjoy himself and caught cold. The result was the \"going in\"\\r\\nof the eruption and a beautiful cough. I succeeded in my efforts and the\\r\\nnext day he had the erysipelas going along nicely, but no cough. I write\\r\\nthis so you will take proper care of yourself and shun conjurers and their\\r\\n\"pow-wow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTOXEMIA, SEPTICEMIA; PYEJMIA.--Toxemia refers to the group of symptoms and\\r\\nlesions caused by the presence in the blood of toxins (poison) usually\\r\\nresulting from bacterial growths.\\r\\n\\r\\nSepticemia refers to the condition caused by the presence in the blood of\\r\\nbacteria (microbes) as well as toxin.\\r\\n\\r\\nPyemia refers to the same condition as septicemia with the development of\\r\\nfresh places of suppuration.\\r\\n\\r\\nSapremia is a septic intoxication, the result of the absorption of toxins.\\r\\n\\r\\n[INFECTIOUS DISEASES 223]\\r\\n\\r\\nSEPTICEMIA.--The presence of bacteria in the blood, introduced from a\\r\\nlocal lesion (wound, injury, etc.) or with no obvious local infection.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptom.--If there is a local infection, symptoms of this precede the\\r\\nsepticemia. The invasion may be sudden or gradual, with chill or chilly\\r\\nfeelings, followed by symptoms of active fever and later of an asthenic\\r\\n(absence of strength and feeling) fever, with dry tongue and dullness or\\r\\ndelirium. Death may occur in one to seven days.\\r\\n\\r\\nPYEMIA.--This means the presence in the blood of bacteria with resultant\\r\\nfoci (places) of suppuration.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--They are local at first where the lesion is. The invasion of\\r\\nthe general infection is marked by a severe chill, then high fever and\\r\\nsweating, repeated daily or at irregular intervals.\\r\\n\\r\\nFever is variable with sudden falls. In some cases the fever assumes very\\r\\nweakening type and the patient looks like a case of typhoid fever in the\\r\\nthird week, and death soon occurs.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn other cases the chills, fever and sweating are repeated at irregular\\r\\nintervals. The patients are emaciated and the skin has a sallow color.\\r\\nDeath usually occurs eventually from exhaustion in a few days or months.\\r\\n\\r\\nLocal Treatment.--This should be attended to from the beginning. If you\\r\\ninjure your finger or any part and it soon looks red, and feels sore, open\\r\\nit up thoroughly with a clean instrument and cover it with a clean gauze\\r\\nor cotton. It must not be covered too tightly so that the discharge, if\\r\\nany, can leave the wound. Enough dressing must be put on to absorb that.\\r\\nThen keep the wound clean, and so it can \"run\" if necessary. If you\\r\\nneglect this or do it carelessly and admit dirt you will make it worse.\\r\\n\\r\\nSee treatment of wounds, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral Treatment.--Keep the strength up in every way. The strength should\\r\\nbe kept up by giving nourishing diet that will suit that special case and\\r\\nmedicine that will produce a tonic effect, such as quinine and strychnine.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nASIATIC CHOLERA.--This is an acute infectious disease caused by a specific\\r\\norganism and characterized by profuse watery discharges from the bowels\\r\\nand great prostration.\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses.--Some inherit a weakness, making them more susceptible than others\\r\\nto this disease. Other causes are intemperance, general debility,\\r\\nunhygienic surroundings, exciting causes. The spirillum (cholera\\r\\nasiaticus) found in the stools, watery discharges and intestines of\\r\\naffected cases and its transmission by infected food and water.\\r\\n\\r\\n[224 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--After an incubation period of about one to five days, the\\r\\ninvasion is marked either by simple diarrhea with some general ill-feeling\\r\\nand prostration, or by abdominal pains, vomiting and diarrhea. Mild cases\\r\\nmay recover at this time. In the stage of collapse, there are frequent\\r\\nwatery movements resembling rice water, with vomiting, great thirst,\\r\\nabdominal pains and eruptions on the legs. There is sudden collapse and\\r\\ntemperature that is below normal; nearly all secretions are greatly\\r\\ndiminished. In the so-called cases of cholera sicca (dry) death occurs\\r\\nbefore the diarrhea begins, although a rice water fluid is found in the\\r\\nintestines after death. After two to twenty-four hours those who have not\\r\\ndied may recover or pass into the stage of reaction in which the signs of\\r\\ncollapse and purging disappear. After improvement, with slight rise of\\r\\ntemperature at times, there may be a relapse or the patient may have\\r\\ninflammation of some of the viscera (cavity organs) and suppression of the\\r\\nurine with delirium, coma and death.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prognosis is worse in infancy, old age and debilitated persons, and in\\r\\ncases of rapid collapse, low temperature and great blueness. Death rate\\r\\nfrom thirty to eighty per cent.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--Isolate the patient and disinfect all discharges and clothing.\\r\\n\\r\\nUse boiled water during an epidemic.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor pain, morphine hypodermically, and apply hot applications to the\\r\\nabdomen.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor vomiting.--Wash out the stomach and give cocaine, ice, coffee, brandy\\r\\nor water by the mouth. Intestines may be irrigated with a two per cent\\r\\nsolution of tannic acid.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring collapse.--Hypodermic of camphor, hot applications to the body.\\r\\nGood nursing and careful diet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nYELLOW FEVER.--Yellow fever is an acute infectious disease characterized\\r\\nby jaundice, hemorrhages, albuminuria (albumin in the urine).\\r\\n\\r\\nCause.--It is common in the West Indies and epidemic in nearby countries.\\r\\nIt is most common in crowded, dirty, poorly drained portions of sea coast\\r\\ncities. It is probably caused by a specific organism which is conveyed\\r\\nfrom one person to another by mosquitoes and not in clothing, as formerly\\r\\nbelieved. One attack usually confers immunity.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--Incubation is about three to four days. There may be a\\r\\nfore-warning period, but the attack is usually sudden, with chills,\\r\\nheadache, backache, rise in fever, and general feverish symptoms,\\r\\nvomiting, and constipation. Early in this disease the face is flushed,\\r\\nwhile the conjunctiva and the mucous membrane lining the eyelids is\\r\\ncongested and slightly jaundiced. Fever is 102 or 103 degrees, and falls\\r\\ngradually after one to three days. Pulse is slow, and while the\\r\\ntemperature rises, it again falls. The stage of calm follows the fall of\\r\\nthe temperature with increased jaundice and vomiting of dark altered\\r\\nblood, the \"black vomit.\" Hemorrhages may also occur into the skin or\\r\\nmucous membranes. Brain symptoms are sometimes severe. Convalescence   is\\r\\nusually gradual. The disease varies from great mildness to extreme\\r\\nmalignancy. Mortality from fifteen to eighty-five per cent.\\r\\n\\r\\n[INFECTIOUS DISEASES 225]\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--Prevent spread of the infectious mosquitoes; use screens and\\r\\nnetting in infected districts. Careful nursing, food by rectum while\\r\\nvomiting is frequent. For the hemorrhage opium is given; frequent bathing\\r\\nwill keep down the fever; and for the vomiting cocaine is given and\\r\\ncracked ice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPLAGUE (BUBONIC PLAGUE).--Plague is an infectious disease characterized by\\r\\ninflammation and suppuration of the lymph nodes and cutaneous (skin)\\r\\nhemorrhages. It has long been known as the Plague or \"Black Death,\" on\\r\\naccount of its \"flea-bite looking eruptions.\" This disease is becoming a\\r\\nserious matter on our western coast, especially in and around San\\r\\nFrancisco. The disease exists in India all the time, and there is now\\r\\ndanger of it becoming epidemic (existing all the time) in San Francisco,\\r\\naccording to today\\'s, Jan. 10th, Detroit Free Press. Mr. Merriam, chief of\\r\\nthe U. S. Bureau of Biological Survey, recently appeared before congress\\r\\nand asked for more money to investigate this and other conditions, and how\\r\\nto stamp out the carriers of this dreadful disease. European wharf rats,\\r\\nintroduced about San Francisco, have spread the plague to the ground\\r\\nsquirrels, and the gophers, rabbits, field mice, and other rodents are now\\r\\nbeing infected. In India, fleas on the native squirrel, perpetuate the\\r\\nplague. The way to stop the plague is to kill the carriers.\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses.--The bacillus pestis (pests) is transmitted through insects, small\\r\\nanimals, like rats, through the air, or in clothing, bedding, and is\\r\\ncontained in the feces and urine. The poor in unhygienic districts are\\r\\nmost often attacked.\\r\\n\\r\\nBubonic Type.--In this type the lymph nodes, particularly in the arm-pit,\\r\\nand groins show inflammatory lesions with marked overgrowth of new tissue.\\r\\nSometimes there is suppuration, hemorrhage and local death of the part.\\r\\nThe bacilli are formed in great numbers in the affected nodes and\\r\\nsecondary lesions.\\r\\n\\r\\nSepticemic Type.--In this type all lymph nodes and nodules show signs of\\r\\ntoxemia and the bacilli are formed in the primary (first) lesions and in\\r\\nthe blood.\\r\\n\\r\\nPneumonic Type.--In this type there are areas of broncho-pneumania, with\\r\\nlesions of the bronchial lymph nodes. The bacilli occur in these\\r\\nsituations and in the sputa.\\r\\n\\r\\n[226 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--In the bubonic plague (the usual form) the invasion is marked\\r\\nby headache, depression, pain in the back, stiffness of the extremities\\r\\nand fever. This rises for three or four days, then falls several degrees\\r\\nand is followed by a more severe secondary fever of the prostrating type.\\r\\nAt about the third to the fifth day the lymph nodes usually become\\r\\nenlarged most often in the inguinal (groin) region. This is followed by a\\r\\nresolution (getting better) suppuration forming pus or necrosis (local\\r\\ndeath of the part). \"A flea bite looking eruption and hemorrhages from the\\r\\nmucous membrane often occur. The mild cases, which often occur at the\\r\\nbeginning of an epidemic, and at its close, are marked only by slight\\r\\nfever and glandular swelling, which may terminate in the forming of pus in\\r\\nthe part. In these cases the symptoms are slight and last only a few\\r\\ndays.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSepticemic Plague.--This is characterized by symptoms of severe general\\r\\ninfection, with hemorrhages, rapid course, and death in three or four\\r\\ndays, without the development of swelling of the lymph nodes. Cultures\\r\\nfrom the blood show bacteria.\\r\\n\\r\\nPneumonic Plague.--The symptoms are those of a severe \"lobular\" pneumonia,\\r\\nwith bloody sputum containing many bacilli. It is usually rapidly fatal.\\r\\nDeath rate may reach ninety per cent.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment. Prevention.--Prolonged isolation, disinfection of the\\r\\ndischarges, cremation of plague victims, destruction of rats, and\\r\\npreventive inoculation of healthy persons with sterilized cultures of the\\r\\nbacillus pestis.\\r\\n\\r\\nImmunity following this procedure is said to last from one to eighteen\\r\\nmonths.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor pain, morphine; for weakness, stimulation; for fever, bathing; for\\r\\nbuboes, application of ice, injection of bichloride and excision have been\\r\\nadvised.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDYSENTERY.--A group of inflammatory intestinal affections, either acute or\\r\\nchronic, and of infectious origin, characterized by frequent painful\\r\\npassages, (containing mucus and blood) or by loose movements.\\r\\n\\r\\nAcute Catarrhal Dysentery.--This is the most common form in the temperate\\r\\nclimate The colon is congested and swollen with a covering of blood-tinged\\r\\nmucus on its mucous membrane.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--The invasion: This is usually marked by diarrhea, then\\r\\ncramp-like general pain in the abdomen and frequent mucous, bloody stools,\\r\\naccompanied by hard straining at stool. The temperature may reach 102 to\\r\\n103 degrees. After one or two days the stools consist entirely of bloody\\r\\nmucus and are very frequent. The thirst is great. In about one week the\\r\\nstools may become normal.\\r\\n\\r\\nMOTHERS\\' REMEDIES. 1. Dysentery, Sweet Cream for.--\"One or two\\r\\nteaspoonfuls of thick cream every hour. Three doses is usually sufficient.\\r\\n(This remedy proved successful with my baby when all others failed).\"\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Dysentery, One Ounce Dewberry Root for.--\"Boil in one quart of water\\r\\none ounce of dewberry root. This should be boiled down to one-half pint\\r\\nand a half wineglassful given to patient two or three times a day, or in\\r\\nsevere cases, a half wineglassful every two or three hours until discharge\\r\\ndiminishes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n      INFECTIOUS DISEASES       227\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Dysentery, \"Colt Tail\" Remedy for.--\"The herb called \"Colt Tail,\" steep\\r\\nand drink the tea. It\\'s a tall weed and grows in damp places. It is one of\\r\\nthe best herbs for this.\" This is especially good when the discharge from\\r\\nthe bowels is bloody or contains mucus.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Dysentery, Sugar and Brandy for.--\"Two tablespoonfuls brandy poured\\r\\ninto a saucer. Set fire to the brandy and hold in flame lump of sugar on\\r\\nfork. This is a very good remedy, and has cured cases when doctors\\'\\r\\nremedies failed. This sugar will melt and form a syrup. Dose:--One-half\\r\\nteaspoonful every two hours or oftener if necessary.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n5. Dysentery, Herb Remedy for.--\"Take four ounces poplar bark, four ounces\\r\\nbayberry bark and three ounces tormentil root, simmer gently in four\\r\\nquarts of water, down to three, strain and add two pounds granulated\\r\\nsugar; let it come to boiling point, skim and add one-half pound\\r\\nblackberry or peach jelly and one-half pint best brandy. Keep in a cool\\r\\nplace, take one-half wineglassful three or four times a day or more often\\r\\nif required.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n6. Dysentery, New Method to Cure.--\"A hot hip bath will often relieve\\r\\ndistressing sensations of dysentery or itching piles.\" This is a very\\r\\nsimple remedy and will have a very soothing effect upon the whole system,\\r\\nrelieving any nervousness that may be present and usually is with this\\r\\ndisease.\\r\\n\\r\\n7. Dysentery, Starch Injection for.--\"Use injection of one cup thin boiled\\r\\nstarch, and one-half teaspoonful laudanum. Repeat every 3 to 4 hours.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n8. Dysentery, To Cure Bloody.--\"Put a teaspoonful of salt into a quart of\\r\\nwarm water and inject into the bowels to wash them out thoroughly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPHYSICIANS\\' TREATMENT for Dysentery.--Remain in bed on fluid diet, and\\r\\ngive a free saline cathartic or castor on, one-half ounce, followed by\\r\\nsalol five grains in capsules every three hours.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Bismuth subnitrate, one-half to one dram every two to three hours.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Irrigation of the colon with normal salt solution or weak solution of\\r\\nsilver nitrate at about one hundred degrees with a long rectual tube. Dr.\\r\\nHare, of Philadelphia, recommends one two-hundredth grain of bichloride of\\r\\nmercury every hour or two (in adults), if the stools are slimy and bloody\\r\\nand if much blood is present, and high rectal injections of witch-hazel\\r\\nwater and water, half and half. I know this last is good, and also the\\r\\nfollowing; Oil of fireweed, five drops on sugar every two to three hours.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Ipecac.--In acute dysentery ipecac is one of the best remedies, Dr.\\r\\nHare says; \"When the passages are large and bloody and the disease is\\r\\nmalignant as it occurs in the tropics, ipecac should be given in the\\r\\nfollowing manner: The powdered ipecac is to be administered on an empty\\r\\nstomach in the dose of thirty grains with thirty drops of the tincture of\\r\\ndeodorized opium, which is used to decrease the tendency to vomit.\\r\\nAbsolute rest is essential for its success. Finally a profuse gray, mushy\\r\\nstool is passed.\" This is a favorable sign.\\r\\n\\r\\n[228 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nNursing and Diet.--The patient should always remain in bed and use\\r\\nbed-pan. He must be given a bland, unirritating diet, composed of milk,\\r\\nwith lime-water, beef peptonoids, broth, egg albumin, etc., in acute\\r\\ncases.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMALARIA FEVER.--Malarial fever is a group of diseases characterized by\\r\\nintermittent, quotidian (daily), tertian (every other day) or quartan\\r\\n(every fourth day) fever or remittent fever; there are also several\\r\\npernicious types of this disease and chronic malarial condition of the\\r\\nsystem with enlargement of the spleen.\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses.--It occurs most frequently in low lands, along sea coasts, and\\r\\nswamps, particularly in the tropics and warmer portion of the temperate\\r\\nzone. The exciting cause it what is called the plasmodous malarial, a\\r\\nparasite developing in the body of all species of anopheles, a common form\\r\\nof mosquito and transmitted to man, its intermediate host, by the bite of\\r\\nthe infected mosquitoes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nINTERMITTENT MALARIAL FEVER. (a) Tertian. (b) Quartan. (c) Quotidian.\\r\\nSymptoms.--The symptoms of all these are the same, except that in tertian\\r\\nfever, the paroxysms occur every third day; in quartan they occur every\\r\\nfourth day. Quotidian occurs daily.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe incubation time is unknown. It consists usually of three stages, cold,\\r\\nhot, and sweating, and they usually occur in the morning. \"The cold stage\\r\\nis ushered in by yawning, lassitude and headache, and rapid rise of\\r\\ntemperature; sometimes nausea and vomiting followed by shivering and\\r\\nrather violent shaking with chattering of the teeth.\" It may last from ten\\r\\nminutes to two hours. The internal temperature may rise to 104 to 106\\r\\ndegrees, while the surface is blue and cold, with severe headache, often\\r\\nnausea and vomiting. Hot stage: this may last from one-half to five hours;\\r\\nthe temperature may increase somewhat, the face is flushed, the skin is\\r\\nred and hot, great thirst, throbbing headache and full bounding pulse.\\r\\nSweating stage lasts two to four hours, and entire body may be covered;\\r\\nfever and other symptoms abate and sleep usually follows. The patient\\r\\nfeels nearly well between attacks.\\r\\n\\r\\nREMITTENT OR CONTINUOUS MALARIAL FEVER (Aestivo-Autumnal Fever).--This\\r\\nform occurs in the temperate zone regions, especially in the summer and\\r\\nautumn. The symptoms vary greatly. The fever may be irregularly\\r\\nintermittent, but at longer intervals than the Tertian variety. The cold\\r\\nstage is often absent, and in the hot the temperature falls gradually. The\\r\\nappearance is often like typhoid for there may be then hardly any\\r\\nremission of fever.\\r\\n\\r\\n[INFECTIOUS DISEASES 229]\\r\\n\\r\\nPERNICIOUS MALARIAL FEVER.--This is a very dangerous disease. The chief\\r\\nforms are the comatose, algid and hemorrhagic.\\r\\n\\r\\n(a) Comatose form is characterized by delirium or sudden coma (deep sleep)\\r\\nwith light temperature.\\r\\n\\r\\n(b) The algid or asthenic form begins with vomiting and great prostration.\\r\\nThe temperature is normal or below normal. There may be diarrhea and\\r\\nsuppression of the urine.\\r\\n\\r\\n(c) The hemorrhagic form includes malarial hemoglobinuria, hemoglobin in\\r\\nthe urine. Haemoglobin is the coloring matter of the red corpuscles.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment. Prevention.--Destroy mosquitoes and protect from them by\\r\\nscreens. Small preventive doses of quinine for persons in malarious\\r\\nregions, three grains three times a day. Five grains three times a day\\r\\nwill nearly always cure tertian and quartan cases, especially if the\\r\\npatient is kept in bed until the time for one or two paroxysms has passed.\\r\\nAttacks often stop spontaneously for a time when the patient is kept in\\r\\nbed, even without the administration of quinine.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Remittent Fever larger doses are necessary. For pernicious forms:\\r\\nHydrochlorate of quinine and urea ten to twenty grains, given\\r\\nhypodermically, every three or four hours until improvement occurs, when\\r\\nthe sulphate of quinine by the mouth may be substituted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAGUE. (See Malarial Fever.)--By ague is meant the cold chills and fever;\\r\\nor dumb ague where there is little chill, mostly chilly and fever. These\\r\\nattacks may come on every day, every other day, or every third day.\\r\\n\\r\\nMOTHERS\\' REMEDIES. 1. Ague and Fever, Dogwood Good for.--\"Take one ounce\\r\\nof dogwood root and one quart of water. Make an infusion by boiling down\\r\\nto one-half pint. Strain and give one-half wineglassful every two or three\\r\\nhours.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Ague in Face, Menthol and Alcohol Effective Remedy for.--\"After making\\r\\na solution of teaspoonful of menthol crystals, dissolved in two ounces of\\r\\nalcohol, apply several times a day to the face. Care should be taken that\\r\\nthis solution does not enter the eyes, as it would be injurious,\"\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Ague, Simple Remedy for.--\"Give purgative and follow with quinine. Give\\r\\nlarge 4 grain capsule every four hours.\\r\\n\\r\\nMOTHERS\\' REMEDIES. 1. Chills and Fever, Peruvian Bark and Rhubarb for.--\\r\\n\\r\\n    \"Pure Rye Whisky           4 ounces\\r\\n    Pulverized Peruvian Bark   1 dram\\r\\n    Pulverized Rhubarb         1 ounce\\r\\n\\r\\nMix.\\r\\n\\r\\nPut in bottles. Dose for adults:--One tablespoonful three times a day.\\r\\nThis is an excellent remedy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n[230 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Chills and Fever, Horse-radish for.--\"Take fresh green horseradish\\r\\nleaves, bruise and mash them to the consistency of a poultice and bind on\\r\\nthe bottom of the feet. This will tend to reduce the fever and is a\\r\\nreliable remedy. I have often used this with great satisfaction.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Chills and Fever, Dogwood Known to be Good for.--\"Make a decoction of\\r\\none ounce of dogwood root, boiled in one quart of water down to one pint;\\r\\nstrain, and give half wineglassful every two or three hours.\" This remedy\\r\\nhas been used by our grandmothers for many years, and is one to be\\r\\ndepended upon. The dogwood root can be purchased at any drug store.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--For acute cases quinine in various doses. I usually prescribe\\r\\ntwo grains every two hours until the ears ring, and then take only enough\\r\\nto keep them in that condition.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is well always to see that the bowels and liver are active before\\r\\ntaking quinine. The medicine acts better when the patient remains quiet in\\r\\nbed. If the chill and fever comes on every day, the quinine should be\\r\\ntaken every hour between the paroxysms.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMALTA FEVER.--This occurs in the Mediterranean countries, India, China,\\r\\nthe Philippines and Porto Rico. The fever is irregular or marked by\\r\\nintervals of \"no fever\" for two or more days with febrile relapses lasting\\r\\none to three weeks. Constipation, anemia (scarcity of blood), joint\\r\\nsymptoms and debility exist. Ordinary cases may last three months to two\\r\\nyears. Mortality two per cent.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--Like that for typhoid. Change climate, if possible.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBERI-BERI.--Beri-beri is a disease rarely occurring in the United States.\\r\\nIt is usually found in the warmer climates and peculiar to certain regions\\r\\nsuch as India, and Japan.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is characterized by paralysis and fatal effusion, also neuritis, which\\r\\nis an inflammation of the nerves. It seems to be undecided among the\\r\\nmedical profession as to whether the disease is infectious or not. Some\\r\\nclaim it is brought on by the eating of bad rice or certain raw fish.\\r\\nYoung men in those climates seem to be most susceptible to beri-beri.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--There is very little known about this disease. Fortunately it\\r\\ndoes not often occur here. It is necessary to keep up the strength by food\\r\\nand tonics and relieve the pain.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nANTHRAX. (Charbon, Wool Sorters\\' Disease, Splenic Fever).--This is \"an\\r\\nacute infectious disease of animals, transmitted to man by inoculation\\r\\ninto the wounds, or by inhalation of, or swallowing the germs.\" Butchers,\\r\\ntanners and shepherds are most liable to it. The exciting cause is the\\r\\nbacillus anthracis (anthrax bacillus). The local skin condition is a\\r\\npustule containing the bacilli, which may also invade the general\\r\\ncirculation. If the germs are inhaled, there is broncho-pneumonia; if\\r\\nswallowed, areas of inflammation and local death occur in the intestines.\\r\\nThe spleen and lymph nodes are enlarged.\\r\\n\\r\\n[INFECTIOUS DISEASES 231]\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms. 1. External anthrax, malignant pustule. This begins in a papule\\r\\n(pimple) at the point of inoculation turning into a vesicle and then a\\r\\npustule, (blister-like pimple) surrounded by an inflammatory area (space)\\r\\nwith marked watery swelling. The nearby glands are enlarged and tender. At\\r\\nfirst the temperature rapidly rises; later it may be below normal. The\\r\\nfever symptoms may be severe. Recovery takes place slowly. Death occurs in\\r\\nthree to five days.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMALIGNANT ANTHRAX (swelling).--In this lesion is a pustule, with very\\r\\nmarked swelling. It most frequently occurs on the eyelid and face and the\\r\\nswelling may terminate in fatal gangrene.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Internal anthrax.--(a) Internal anthrax is caused by the introduction\\r\\nof the bacteria into the alimentary canal in infected meat, milk, etc. The\\r\\ninvasion is marked by a chill, followed by moderate fever, vomiting,\\r\\ndiarrhea, pain in the back and legs and restlessness. Sometimes\\r\\nconvulsions occur and hemorrhages into the skin from the mucous membranes.\\r\\nThe spleen is swollen. Prostration is extreme and it often ends in death.\\r\\n\\r\\n(b) Charbon or Wool Sorter\\'s disease occurs among those employed in\\r\\npicking over wool or hair of infected animals--the germs being inhaled or\\r\\nswallowed. The onset is sudden with a chill, then fever, pain in the back\\r\\nand legs, and severe prostration. There may be difficulty of breathing and\\r\\nsigns of bronchitis, or vomiting and diarrhea. Death is a common\\r\\ntermination, sometimes within a day. Death rate is from five to twenty-six\\r\\nper cent. Greatest when the swelling is near the head.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--The wound or swelling should be cauterized and a solution of\\r\\ncarbolic acid or bichloride of mercury injected around it and applied to\\r\\nits surface. Stimulants and feeding are important.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLOCKJAW. (Tetanus).--Tetanus or lockjaw, as it is commonly called, is an\\r\\ninfectious disease and is characterized by painful and violent\\r\\ncontractions of the voluntary muscles; it may be of the jaw alone or of a\\r\\nconsiderable part of the body.\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses.--The intelligence and mental faculties are not impaired. In most\\r\\ncases it follows a wound or injury, although in others there seems to be\\r\\nno exciting causes. Fourth of July celebrations furnish a great many of\\r\\nour lockjaw cases. Ten to fifteen days usually elapse after the wound\\r\\nbefore lockjaw really sets in.\\r\\n\\r\\n[232 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--It comes on occasionally with a chill or chilly feelings;\\r\\nusually by rigidity (stiffness) of the neck, jaw and face. On arising in\\r\\nthe morning there is sometimes a stiffness of the muscles at the back of\\r\\nthe head. It is not unusual on taking a slight cold to have a stiff neck\\r\\nand often the patient\\'s attention is not attracted by this symptom.\\r\\nSometimes this stiffness begins or soon extends to the muscles of the\\r\\nlower jaw; the throat becomes dry and is painful and gradually the\\r\\nstiffness increases to a continuous contraction, spasm, and extends to the\\r\\nmuscles of the trunk and extremities. The body becomes rigid in a straight\\r\\nline or bent backward, forward or sidewise. This spasm occurs after any\\r\\nslight irritation and is extremely painful. Temperature is usually low.\\r\\nDuring the first spasms the patient may attempt to open his mouth as he\\r\\nmay naturally be suspicious of the trouble that is coming; he succeeds\\r\\nwith difficulty and even finds it hard to swallow; soon the jaws may be\\r\\nfirmly closed, and it is from this feature of the disease that it gained\\r\\nthe name of lockjaw. The contractions in some cases do not extend beyond\\r\\nthe neck and face muscles. During the contractions the face may be drawn\\r\\ninto frightful contortions. Food can be given only through such spaces as\\r\\nmay exist between the teeth, as often the patient cannot open his mouth\\r\\nhimself, nor can it be pried open by any force that would be allowable.\\r\\nWhen the muscles of the trunk are affected the abdomen may be drawn\\r\\ninward, become very hard and stiff, chest movements are affected, making\\r\\nit difficult to breathe, sometimes almost to suffocation. Sometimes the\\r\\nbody becomes bent like a bow, as in some cases of spinal meningitis, so\\r\\nthat only the head and heels support the weight of the body. The body may\\r\\nbecome so rigid that it can be lifted by a single limb as you would a\\r\\nstatue. It is fortunate that there are few cases, comparatively, of\\r\\nlockjaw as the distorted face and general contractions of the body are\\r\\npainful to witness.\\r\\n\\r\\nRecovery.--The mortality in lockjaw cases runs about eight per cent.\\r\\nSometimes death is caused by exhaustion from the muscular exertions; the\\r\\npatient is seldom able to sleep and sometimes wears out in a few days.\\r\\nSometimes suffocation brings a sudden end to his sufferings and usually\\r\\none or two days to ten or twelve days is the limit. Among the lower\\r\\nclasses where sanitary science is seldom observed, and even among the\\r\\nbetter classes, lockjaw has been known to occur in infants. It usually\\r\\ncomes on, in ten to fifteen days after birth, and the child seldom lives\\r\\nmore than a few days, It is hard to account for such cases which may come\\r\\non suddenly from the slightest excitement such as sudden noises, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nMOTHERS\\' REMEDIES.--l. Lockjaw, Successful Remedy for.--\"A very good and\\r\\nsuccessful remedy for this disease, is to apply a warm poultice of\\r\\nflaxseed meal, saturated with laudanum and sugar of lead water, to the\\r\\njaws and neck.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Lockjaw, Smoke as a Cure for.--\"Smoke the wound for twenty minutes in\\r\\nthe smoke of burnt woolen cloths. This is considered a never failing\\r\\nremedy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n[INFECTIOUS DISEASES 233]\\r\\n\\r\\nPHYSICIANS\\' TREATMENT.--If from a wound cut open and use antiseptics.\\r\\nIsolate the patient and have absolute quiet. Antitoxin is used with\\r\\nsuccess in some cases of lockjaw, but this and other remedies or measures\\r\\nmust be handled by a physician, Opium is sometimes given and stimulants\\r\\nsuch as brandy, whisky, etc. As it is a case of life or death in a very\\r\\nshort time, we cannot advise depending upon home treatment. A preventive\\r\\ncaution that must always be observed is the use of antiseptics and the\\r\\nstrictest care of all injuries and wounds that might result in lockjaw.\\r\\nThis is a disease where an ounce of prevention is worth a thousand pounds\\r\\nof cure, because by the time the disease is recognized as lockjaw and has\\r\\nreally made an appearance, it may be too late for medical skill. While you\\r\\nare waiting for the doctor you may apply cold cloths or even an ice bag to\\r\\nthe spine. If the spasms are severe let the patient inhale chloroform to\\r\\nkill the pain and quiet him. In the meantime secure the best physician\\r\\nwithin your reach, and follow his directions carefully, be calm and self-\\r\\npossessed when in the presence of the patient, for you must remember that\\r\\nhe has full possession of his mental faculties and will notice every\\r\\nevidence of fear or worry in the faces of those who are nursing him. This\\r\\nwill only add to his sufferings, affect his nervous system and undermine\\r\\nhis general vitality. Read carefully the nursing department in this book\\r\\nand you will gain some valuable hints and knowledge regarding the sick\\r\\nroom.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGLANDERS.--This is an acute disease of the horse and occasionally of man.\\r\\nIt is called \"glanders\" when the affection appears in the nostrils, and is\\r\\ncalled \"farcy\" when in the skin.\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses.--The bacilli is usually introduced from infected horses through\\r\\nthe nose, mouth and cheek, mucous membranes or skin abrasions (rubbing off\\r\\nof the skin). There are large or small lumps in the skin, mucous membrane\\r\\nof the nose and mouth.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms. Acute Glanders.--1. Incubation lasts from three to four days.\\r\\nThere are signs of inflammation at the site of infection and general\\r\\nsymptoms. In two or three days, small lumps appear on the mucous membrane\\r\\nof the nose, and ulcerate, with a discharge of mucus and pus. Sometimes\\r\\nthese nodules die locally, and their discharge is then foul. The glands\\r\\naround the neck are enlarged. An eruption appears over the face and\\r\\njoints. Inflammation of the lungs may occur. Death may take place in eight\\r\\nto ten days.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Chronic Glanders.--This may last for months. It acts like chronic cold\\r\\nwith ulcer in the nose. Some recover.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Acute Farcy.--The local and general signs are those of an infection,\\r\\nwith necrosis (local death) at the site (in the skin) of inoculation;\\r\\nnodules, (lumps) known as \"farcy buds\" form along the lymphatics (glands)\\r\\nand form pus. There may be pus collections in the joints and muscles.\\r\\nDeath often occurs in one to five days.\\r\\n\\r\\nChronic Farcy.--Tumors in the skin of the extremities, containing pus. The\\r\\nprocess is local, the inflammatory symptoms light, and the duration may be\\r\\nmonths or years.\\r\\n\\r\\n[234 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment of Glanders.--This disease does not often occur in man; it is an\\r\\nawful affliction. All infected horses must be killed, it is dangerous for\\r\\nman to be around one. If seen early, the wound should be cut out or burned\\r\\nout with caustics, and afterwards dressed like any wound. The \"farcy buds\"\\r\\nshould be opened early. There is very little hope in acute cases of\\r\\nglanders. In chronic cases recovery is possible, but it will be after a\\r\\nlong tedious time. There must be proper nourishing food and tonic\\r\\nmedicines. Each case should be treated according to the indications. It is\\r\\nsafe to say the parts should be thoroughly cut or scraped out and then\\r\\ntreated with antiseptics and the general system built up, by tonics and\\r\\nstimulating remedies, if needed. As stated before, acute glanders and\\r\\nacute farcy are almost always fatal.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBIG-JAW OR LUMP-JAW. (Actinomycosis).--This is an infectious disease of\\r\\ncattle, less frequently of man, and it is caused by what is called the\\r\\n\"ray fungus.\" This grows in the tissues and develops a mass with a\\r\\nsecondary chronic inflammation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis disease is widespread among cattle, and also occurs in the pig. In\\r\\nthe ox it is called the \"big jaw.\" The infection may be taken in with the\\r\\nfood, and it locates itself often in the mouth or surroundings. Oats,\\r\\nbarley, and rye may carry the germ to the animals. The fungus may be found\\r\\neven in decayed teeth.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlimentary Canal Type.--The jaw has been affected in man. One side of the\\r\\nface is swollen or there may be a chronic enlargement of the jaw, which\\r\\nmay look like a sarcoma (tumor). The tongue also is sometimes affected and\\r\\nshows small growths. It may also occur in the intestines and liver. There\\r\\nis at first a tumor (lump), and this finally suppurates.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Lungs.--They also can be affected. It is chronic here and there is\\r\\ncough, fever, wasting and an expectoration of mucus and pus, sometimes of\\r\\na very bad odor (fetid). It sometimes acts like miliary tuberculosis of\\r\\nthe lungs, and this is quite frequent in oxen. Other diseases of the lungs\\r\\nand bronchial affections occur and abscesses and cavities are formed that\\r\\nmay be diagnosed during life.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--If in the jaw there may be toothache, difficulty of swallowing\\r\\nand of opening the jaw. The adjacent muscles may be hardened (indurated).\\r\\nA swelling appears at the angle of the jaw and this quickly passes into\\r\\nsuppuration; later it opens first outside, then inside--into the mouth and\\r\\ndischarges pus containing little yellow masses. It will extend down even\\r\\ninto the bowels unless it is properly treated. Then there will be stomach\\r\\ndisturbances and diarrhea. It may ulcerate through the bowels and cause\\r\\nperitonitis. The liver, spleen and ovaries may also become affected.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Skin.--There may be chronic suppurating ulcers of the skin and the\\r\\n\"ray fungus\" can be found in them.\\r\\n\\r\\nDiagnosis.--The \"ray fungus\" can be found. There is a wooden hardness of\\r\\nthe tissues beyond the borders of the ulcers; there are the little yellow\\r\\ngranules in the pus. The course is chronic. Mild cases recover in six to\\r\\nnine months or earlier, the mouth form being the most favorable.\\r\\n\\r\\n[INFECTIOUS DISEASES 235]\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--Surgical. Remove the parts involved. Internally, iodide of\\r\\npotash in large doses is recommended. The food should be plenty and\\r\\nnourishing. In this case we must recommend you to a physician instead of\\r\\nthe home treatments.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGONORRHEA (Urethritis).--This can be called an infectious inflammation of\\r\\nthe urethra, caused by the gonococcus, a microbe or germ, causing a\\r\\nspecific inflammation of the mucous membrane of the urethra or vagina.\\r\\n\\r\\nIncubation.--The time that elapses between the exposure and development of\\r\\nthe symptoms in the urethra is variable, extending from a few hours to\\r\\ntwelve or fourteen days. In the great majority of cases, however, the\\r\\ndisease appears during the first week. The patient notices a drop of\\r\\nmilk-like fluid at the opening of the urethra, which is slight, red and\\r\\npuffed or turned out; a tickling sensation is often felt in this locality,\\r\\nand the next time urine is passed it is attended with a feeling of warmth\\r\\nat the end of the canal, or with actual scalding. After this the symptoms\\r\\nincrease rapidly in number and severity, so that within forty-eight hours,\\r\\nor even sooner, the disease may be described as having passed its first or\\r\\nincreasing stage, the characteristic phenomena of which are as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\nChanges in the meatus (opening). There are redness, eversion (turning\\r\\nout), ulceration and eating away and often erosion of the lips of the\\r\\nopening of urethra. Sometimes, but rarely, so much swelling that the\\r\\nperson can hardly pass the urine, which drops away. The other symptoms are\\r\\ntoo well-known by those who have had this disease to need a description.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrognosis.--It is now considered more than a cold, and it is the cause of\\r\\nterrible sickness in both sexes, among the innocent as well as the guilty.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--It may be cured perhaps in a short time, and yet no one can be\\r\\ncertain of its absolute cure. This disease is better understood now, and\\r\\nthe treatment is entirely different from formerly. The strong injections\\r\\nare now considered not only useless but dangerous to the future health of\\r\\nthe patient. The best treatment is mild antiseptic injections, irrigation\\r\\ncarefully done by an expert person; remaining quietly in bed, being\\r\\ncareful to use food and drink that are not stimulating, keeping the bowels\\r\\nopen by proper diet and mild laxatives and the urine mild by soothing\\r\\ndiuretic remedies. Unfortunately those affected want quick work and they\\r\\nget it, frequently to their future sorrow. The following are good\\r\\ninjections. Before each injection the urine should be passed and an\\r\\ninjection of an antiseptic like listerine, etc., one dram to an ounce of\\r\\nboiled water, to cleanse the canal. You can use twice a day the following:\\r\\n\\r\\n    Fluid Extract Hydrastis (colored)    1 dram\\r\\n    Water                                1 ounce\\r\\n\\r\\nUse one dram of this for each injection. It stains the clothes so you must\\r\\nbe careful. This is good and healing.\\r\\n\\r\\n[236  MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nGONORRHEAL ARTHITIS. (Gonorrheal Rheumatism, Inflammation of the\\r\\nJoints).--This is more common in men than women. Occurring during, and at\\r\\nthe end of or after inflammation of the urethra. It usually involves many\\r\\njoints, such as the temporal, maxillary and collar bone. The effusion in\\r\\nthe joints is usually serious.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--Variable joint pains may be the only one. The attack may\\r\\nresemble an acute articular rheumatism of one joint, or a subacute\\r\\nrheumatism of one or more.\\r\\n\\r\\nSometimes there is a chronic one-jointed inflammation usually of the knee.\\r\\nThe tendon sheaths and bursae may be involved alone, or with the joints.\\r\\nGonorrheal septicemia may result from arthritis. This is protracted.\\r\\nIritis is a most frequent complication. The urethra source of the\\r\\ninfection must be cured.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--Keep the joint quiet and you can use an ice cap for the pain.\\r\\nTonic treatment with quinine, iron, and arsenic in chronic cases is\\r\\nneeded. The joints should be kept at rest in acute cases. In chronic cases\\r\\nmassage and slight motion. The tonics must be chosen for each individual\\r\\ncase. One afflicted with this must be under treatment for a long time.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHIP JOINT DISEASE. (Morbus Coxarius).--This is more common in children\\r\\nthan in adults.\\r\\n\\r\\nCause.--It is usually tubercular.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms. First stage.--It may be overlooked; slight lameness, a little\\r\\nstiffness is noticed at times. The muscles begin to dwindle.\\r\\n\\r\\nSecond stage.--Child limps very perceptibly, dwindling is more apparent.\\r\\nPain appears.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--Absolute rest. Lying down treatment if begun early arrests\\r\\nthis disease often. Build up the system. Splints and brace are needed\\r\\nsometimes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nKNEE JOINT DISEASE. (White Swelling).--This is simply a tuberculous knee.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--Rest. Stop motion of the joint by some form of splint or\\r\\nplaster of Paris cast. Get a good physician at the beginning in these\\r\\ncases and you will save lots of after worry and blame for yourself. It\\r\\ndoes not pay to wait. These joint diseases will progress, and often\\r\\ntreatment is begun months after trouble is seated. It ought to be criminal\\r\\nnegligence and dealt with accordingly to neglect such diseases. Parents\\r\\nshould never forget that they have endowed their children with such a\\r\\nconstitution, and they should be glad and willing to correct it as far as\\r\\nthey can.\\r\\n\\r\\n[INFECTIOUS DISEASES 237]\\r\\n\\r\\nLEPROSY. Definition.--Leprosy is a chronic infectious disease, caused by\\r\\nwhat is called the \"Bacillus Leprae,\" and is characterized by the presence\\r\\nof tubercular nodules in the skin and mucous membranes (tubercular\\r\\nleprosy), or by changes in the nerves (anaesthetic leprosy). These forms\\r\\nare separate at first, but ultimately they are combined and there are\\r\\ndisturbances of sensation in the characteristic tubercular form.\\r\\n\\r\\nHistory.--Leprosy is supposed to have originated in the Orient, and to be\\r\\nas old as the records of history. It appears to have prevailed in Egypt\\r\\neven so far back as three or four thousand years before Christ. The Hebrew\\r\\nwriters make many references to it, and it is no doubt described in\\r\\nLeviticus. The affection was also known both in India and China many\\r\\ncenturies before the Christian era. The old Greek and Roman physicians\\r\\nwere familiar with its manifestations, ancient Peruvian pottery represent\\r\\non their pieces deformities suggestive of this disease. The disease\\r\\nprevailed extensively in Europe throughout the middle ages and the number\\r\\nof leper asylums has been estimated at, at least, 20,000. Its prevalence\\r\\nis now restricted in the lands where it still occurs while once it was\\r\\nprominent in the list of scourges of the old world.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is now found in Norway and to a less extent in Sweden, in Bulgaria,\\r\\nGreece, Russia, Austro-Hungary and Italy, with much reduced percentage in\\r\\nmiddle Europe; it is the rarest of diseases in England where once it\\r\\nexisted. In India, Java, and China, in Egypt, Algiers, and Southern\\r\\nAfrica, in Australia and in both North and South America, including\\r\\nparticularly Central America, Cuba, and the Antilles, it exists to a less\\r\\nextent. It has been recognized in the United States chiefly in New\\r\\nOrleans, San Francisco, (predominantly among the Chinese population of\\r\\nthat city). The disease has steadily decreased among the latter colonists\\r\\nin Minnesota, Wisconsin and Iowa. Isolated cases have been recognized in\\r\\nalmost every state, and leprous cases are presented at the public\\r\\ncharities of New York, Philadelphia, Boston, etc. The estimated number of\\r\\nlepers a few years ago in the United States varied between two hundred and\\r\\nfive hundred. It is represented as diminishing in frequency in the\\r\\nHawaiian Islands, Porto Rico and the Philippines. In the Hawaiian Islands\\r\\nit spread rapidly after 1860, and strenuous attempts have been made to\\r\\nstamp it out by segregating all lepers on the island of Molokai. There\\r\\nwere 1,152 lepers in that settlement in 1894. In British India, according\\r\\nto the leprosy commission, there were 100,000 lepers in 1900.\\r\\n\\r\\nCause.--The bacillus, discovered by Hansen, of Bergen, in 1874, is\\r\\nuniversally recognized as the cause of leprosy. It has many points of\\r\\nresemblance to the tubercle bacillus. These bacilli have been found in the\\r\\ndwellings and clothing of lepers as well as in the dust of apartments\\r\\noccupied by the victims.\\r\\n\\r\\n[238 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe usual vehicle by which the disease is transmitted is the secretions of\\r\\na leprous patient containing bacilli or spores. The question of\\r\\ninheritance of leprosy is regarded now as standing in the same position as\\r\\nthat relating to the inheritance of tuberculosis; no foetus, no new-born\\r\\nliving child, has been known to exhibit the symptoms of either disease.\\r\\nSeveral cases have been cited where infants but a few weeks old exhibited\\r\\nsymptoms of leprosy. It affects men more than women. Infection is more\\r\\ncommon after the second decade, though children are occasionally among its\\r\\nvictims. When it occurs in countries where it had not previously existed,\\r\\nits appearance is invariably due to the infection of sound individuals by\\r\\nlepers first exhibiting symptoms where the disease is prevalent.\\r\\n\\r\\nNeisser states this: \"The number of lepers in any country bears an inverse\\r\\nratio to the laws executed for the care and isolation of infected persons.\\r\\nThe disease appears to spread more rapidly in damp and cold, or warm and\\r\\nmoist, climates than in temperate countries. It is not now regarded as\\r\\ncontagious. The leprosy of the book of Leviticus not only includes lepra,\\r\\nas that term is understood today, but also psoriasis, scabies and other\\r\\nskin affections,\" The leper, in the eye of the Mosaic law, was\\r\\nceremoniously unclean, and capable of communicating a ceremonial\\r\\nuncleanness. Several of the narratives contained in the Bible bear witness\\r\\nto the fact that the Oriental leper was seen occasionally doing service in\\r\\nthe courts of kings, and even in personal communication and contact with\\r\\nofficers of high rank.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--Previous symptoms: Want of appetite, headache, chills,\\r\\nalternating with mild or severe feverish attacks, depression, nosebleed,\\r\\nstomach and bowel disturbances, sleeplessness. The durations of these\\r\\nsymptoms is variable. Some patients will remember that these symptoms\\r\\npreceded for years the earliest outbreak of lepra (leprosy). In other\\r\\ncases only a few weeks elapsed. These earlier skin lesions are tubercular,\\r\\nmacular (patches), or bullous elevations of the horny layer of the skin.\\r\\nIt may then be divided into three varieties tuberculous, macular and\\r\\nanaesthetic.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLEPRA TUBEROSA. (Tuberculated, Nodulated or Tegumentary (skin) Leprosy).--\\r\\nThis nodular type comprises from ten to fifty per cent of cases. After the\\r\\noccurring of the symptoms just mentioned spotted lesions appear, which are\\r\\nbean to tomato in size, reddish brown or bronze-hued patches, roundish,\\r\\noval or irregular in contour, well defined, and they occur upon the face,\\r\\ntrunk and extremities. The skin covering them is either smooth and\\r\\nshining, as if oiled, or is infiltrated, nodulated and elevated. The\\r\\nsurface of the reddened spots is often oversensitive.\\r\\n\\r\\n[INFECTIOUS DISEASES 239]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a period ranging from weeks to years, tubercles rise from the spots\\r\\ndescribed, varying in size from a pea to that of a nut, and they may be as\\r\\nlarge as a tomato. They are in color, yellowish, reddish-brown, or\\r\\nbronzed, often shining as if varnished or oiled, are covered with a soft,\\r\\nnatural, or slightly scaling outer skin, roundish or irregular in shape\\r\\nand are isolated or grouped numbers of very small and ill-determined\\r\\nnodules may often be seen by careful examination of the skin in the\\r\\nvicinity of those that are developed. They may run together and cause\\r\\nbroad infiltrations and from this surface new nodules spring. They may be\\r\\nin the skin or under the skin and feel soft or firm. The eruption of these\\r\\ntubercles is usually preceded at the onset by fever, as well as by puffy\\r\\nswelling of the involved region, eyelids, ears, etc. These leprous\\r\\ntubercles choose the face as their favored site. They mass here in great\\r\\nnumbers, and thus produce the characteristic deformity of the countenance\\r\\nthat has given to the disease one of its names, Leontiasis (lion face).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn such faces the tubercles arrange themselves in parallel series above\\r\\nthe brows down to the nose, over the cheeks, lips and chin, and as a\\r\\nresult of the infiltration and development of the conditions the brows\\r\\ndeeply over-hang; the globes of the eyes, and the ears, are so studded\\r\\nwith tubercular masses as to stand out from the side of the head. The\\r\\ntrunk and extremities, including the palms of the hands and soles of the\\r\\nfeet, are then usually involved to a less degree. The arm-pit, genital and\\r\\nmammary regions, and more rarely the neck and the palms of the hands and\\r\\nsoles of the feet, may be invaded. In occasional cases when the\\r\\ndevelopment of tubercles upon the face and ears is extensive, there may\\r\\nnot be more than from five to fifty upon the rest of the body, and these\\r\\neither widely scattered and isolated or agglomerated in a single hard,\\r\\nflat, elevated plaque of infiltration upon the elbow or thigh. When the\\r\\ntubercles run together (become confluent) large plaques of infiltration\\r\\nmay form, which are elevated and brownish or blackish in color.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe soft palate and larynx are often involved when the skin lesions are\\r\\npresent. The voice may sound gruff and hoarse, and the tongue, the larynx\\r\\nand soft palate have been found studded with small sized, ashen-hued\\r\\ntubercles. These tumors or tubercles may degenerate and form into\\r\\nirregularly outlined, sharply cut, glazed ulcers, with a bloody or\\r\\nsloughing floor, or they may disappear and leave behind pigmented,\\r\\nshrunken depressions, or they lose their shapes from partial resorption. A\\r\\nlarge plaque may flatten in the center until an annular disk is left to\\r\\nshow its former location. Coincident symptoms are disturbance in the\\r\\nfunctions of the sweat and sebaceous secretion, thinning and loss of hair\\r\\nin the regions involved, especially the eyebrows, and disorders of\\r\\nsensibility. Later results, are a nasal catarrh, atrophy of the sexual\\r\\norgans in both sexes, with impairment or loss of procreative power,\\r\\nhopeless blindness. However the course of the disease is very slow, and\\r\\nyears may elapse before these several changes are accomplished. Often the\\r\\ndisease appears quiescent for months at a time, after which fever occurs\\r\\nand with it acute or sub-acute manifestations appear, including gland\\r\\ndisease, orchitis, ulcerative processes, slow or rapid, followed by\\r\\ngangrene and a relatively rapid progress is made toward a fatal\\r\\nconclusion.\\r\\n\\r\\nToward the last the mutilations effected by the disease may result. Parts\\r\\nof the fingers or toes, whole fingers or toes, and entire hand or foot may\\r\\nbecome wholly or partially detached by the ulcerative and other\\r\\ndegenerations. This stage of this type of the disease may extend through\\r\\nten or more years. After it has fully developed the dejected countenance\\r\\nof the leper, with his leonine expression and general appearance is highly\\r\\ncharacteristic.\\r\\n\\r\\n[240 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nLEPRA MACULOSA.--This form is more common in tropical countries and is\\r\\ndistinguished chiefly by its macular (spotty) lesions. In size they vary\\r\\nfrom a small coin to areas as large as a platter. They are diffused or\\r\\ncircumscribed, roundish or shaped irregularly, yellowish, brownish or\\r\\nbronzed in color, often shiny or glazed. They may be infiltrated and may\\r\\nbe elevated, or on a level with the adjacent tissues. The patches are\\r\\nusually at first very sensitive, but they finally become insensitive, so\\r\\nthat a knife can be thrust deeply into them without being felt. The\\r\\nregions chiefly affected by this type are the back, exposed parts, the\\r\\nbacks of the hands and wrists, the forehead, the cheeks, ears, back of the\\r\\nfeet, and ankles. The eruptions may be scanty or general; conspicuous or\\r\\ninsignificant. The eruptive symptoms are associated commonly, early or\\r\\nlate, with the serious phenomena described below.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLEPRA ANAESTHETICA. (Nerve Leprosy. Atrophic Leprosy. Lepra\\r\\nTrophoneurotica).--Before the development of this form of leprosy there\\r\\nmay be one or two years of ill-health. Usually the skin at this time\\r\\nbecomes in localized patches over-sensitive, sometimes there is\\r\\nover-sensitiveness and special nerves, because of their enlargement,\\r\\nbecome accessible to the touch. Those named later become tender, and the\\r\\nseat of lancinating or shooting pains. This clinical variety may be\\r\\ncommingled in its symptoms with each of the other types. With or without\\r\\nsuch commingling, however, there commonly is noted, after exposure to cold\\r\\nor after being subject to chills first an eruption, red (erythematous)\\r\\npatches, or of \"bullae,\" size of a bean on cheeks, ears, back of the feet,\\r\\nand ankles. The eruption may be outer skin covering (epidermis) and filled\\r\\nwith a clear tinted or blood-mixed serum, and usually occurring upon the\\r\\nextremities. The scars that follow are shrunken (atrophic) patches, each\\r\\noften greater in extent than the base of the original trouble, color\\r\\nwhitish, shiny, glazed, or better described as a tint suggesting the hue\\r\\nof mica; their outline is circular and form also the dumb-bell figure by\\r\\nrunning (coalescing) together, or juxtaposition. These scars are always\\r\\nwithout sensitiveness (anaesthetic), and they may exist together with\\r\\nspotted and non-sensitive patches upon the trunk or other parts such as\\r\\nthe face, hands, feet, ankles, thighs, but rarely on the palms and soles.\\r\\nNeither those of the one class nor of the other, however, are disposed\\r\\nover the surface of the body in lines, bands or curves, corresponding with\\r\\nthe distribution of the skin (cutaneous) nerves. Sometimes the ulnar and\\r\\nother nerves (median, posterior tibial, peroneal, facial and radial) that\\r\\nare accessible to the touch are swollen, tender, insensitive or as rigid\\r\\nas hardened cords. Reddish-gray swellings may be recognized by the eye\\r\\nalong the nerve tract. General shrinking skin symptoms follow. The skin\\r\\nbecomes dry and harsh; there is little or no sebaceous product and the\\r\\nskin of the face seems tightly drawn over the bones. As a consequence of\\r\\ndeforming shrinking (atrophy) of the eyelids, a persistent overflow of\\r\\ntears, consequent eye changes follow, and a constant flow of saliva\\r\\nescapes from the parted lips. The fingers are half drawn into the palm of\\r\\nthe hands; the nails are distorted and ulceration occurs later. These\\r\\nulcers are irregular, oval, roundish or linear in form covered with thin\\r\\nblackish, flattened, tenacious crusts with soft bases, and their floors\\r\\ncovered with a soft debris mixed with blood, the whole insensitive to\\r\\nevery foreign body, and external application. At last the symptoms of\\r\\nmutilating lepra (leprosy) may occur, digits or portions of the wrist,\\r\\npart of hand (meta carpus) or corresponding portions of the foot may be\\r\\ndetached from the body. Death may occur at any time during the course of\\r\\nthe disease. In this form it is said to last from eighteen to twenty years\\r\\nand is thus not so rapidly fatal as the tubercular variety.\\r\\n\\r\\n[INFECTIOUS DISEASES 241]\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--The main treatment is the isolation and segregation of all\\r\\nlepers from contact with the well; wholesome laws are enforced in some\\r\\ncountries where leprosy prevails, and provision is made not only for the\\r\\nisolation and segregation, but also for their care. On account of its\\r\\nrelative variety America has not yet awakened and legislation only forbids\\r\\nthe entry of infected persons. At Molokai, in the Hawaiian Islands,\\r\\nprovision is made for the care of lepers. Many of the public hospitals for\\r\\nthe care of the sick poor refuse to receive lepers. The child of a leprous\\r\\nwoman should be removed from the mother after birth and not nursed by\\r\\nanother woman. No medicines are known to have any curative effect. An\\r\\nimmediate change of residence and climate should be made if the patient\\r\\nhappens to live in a district where the disease prevails. A highly\\r\\nnutritious diet should be taken.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe outlook.--The future is in general dark for the leper. It is often of\\r\\na malignant character, and a fatal result is the rule. A change of climate\\r\\nand conditions may help. Scandinavian lepers who have removed to the\\r\\nUnited States have been greatly benefited by the change, but there is no\\r\\nknown cure. The isolation should be as effective as that for tuberculosis.\\r\\nIt is not contagious but infectious.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHYDROPHOBIA.--Rabies and hydrophobia are two different terms, meaning the\\r\\nsame disease, the former meaning to rage or become mad. This term applies\\r\\nmore especially to the disease as it exists in the maniacal form in the\\r\\nlower animals, while hydrophobia comes from the Greek, meaning \"dread of\\r\\nwater.\" As we occasionally find this dread of water only in the human\\r\\nsubject, the term is properly used in such a case. The lower animals\\r\\nfrequently attempt to drink water even though the act brings on a\\r\\nspasmodic contraction of the swallowing (deglutitory) muscles. Hydrophobia\\r\\nis an acute infectious disease communicated to man by the bite of an\\r\\nanimal suffering from rabies. It is due to a definite specific virus which\\r\\nis transmitted through the saliva by the bite of a rabid animal. Its\\r\\nnatural habitat (location) is the nervous system, and it does not retain\\r\\nits virulence when introduced into any other system of organs. It is\\r\\nessentially a nervous disease and transmitted by the saliva of rabid\\r\\nanimals. When inoculated into a wound this virus must come in contact with\\r\\na broken nerve trunk in order to survive and reproduce itself. If by\\r\\naccident it attacks the end of the broken nerve trunk, it slowly and\\r\\ngradually extends to the higher nerve centers and eventually produces the\\r\\ndisease.\\r\\n\\r\\n[242 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe incubation, or the time it takes for the disease to develop, varies,\\r\\nbut usually is from three to six months. There is a recorded case where\\r\\nthe person began to show symptoms of the disease thirteen days after\\r\\nhaving received a severe wound on the head. The incubation period is\\r\\nseldom longer than six months. The symptoms of the disease in the human\\r\\nbeing vary within narrow limits. There are three classic symptoms usually\\r\\nencountered, and these are fear, apprehension or excitement, together with\\r\\ndeglutitory (swallowing) spasms, terminating in general paralysis. The\\r\\npatient remains conscious of his agony to the end, but the period of\\r\\nillness is of short duration, lasting from one to three days.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bites of rabid dogs cause ninety per cent of the cases in man and\\r\\nanimals. The cat is the next important factor in spreading the disease and\\r\\nabout six per cent of the cases are caused by this animal. For other cases\\r\\nfour per cent come from bites of horses, wolves, foxes, etc. The wolf in\\r\\nRussia, or other animals like it, may be the chief cause there; but dogs\\r\\ncause ninety per cent, taking all the cases found. Man, dog, cat, horse,\\r\\ncattle, sheep, goat, hog, deer, etc., are subject to the disease either\\r\\nnaturally or experimentally. The disease is confined commonly to dogs,\\r\\nbecause the dog naturally attacks animals of his own species and thus\\r\\nkeeps the disease limited mainly to his own kind. Naturally the dog\\r\\nfollows this rule, but on the other hand, in the latter stages of the\\r\\ndisease he usually goes to the other extreme and even attacks his own\\r\\nmaster, etc. The dogs that are the most dangerous and do the greatest\\r\\ndamage are of the vicious breeds.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rabbit or guinea pig is used for demonstration in the laboratory.\\r\\nGuinea pigs respond to the virus more rapidly than do other animals and\\r\\ntherefore they are especially useful in diagnostic work. Rabbits, however,\\r\\non account of the convenient size and ease with which they are operated\\r\\nupon, are usually the choice in the production of material used in\\r\\ntreating patients.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe director of one Pasteur Institute says, \"We have two classes of\\r\\npatients to deal with in the Pasteur institute. The larger class, of\\r\\ncourse, are those inoculated by the bite of rabid animals, but we also\\r\\nhave a few who are infected by the rabid saliva accidentally coming in\\r\\ncontact with wounds already produced. In these accidental eases the\\r\\ndisease is almost as likely to result as in those to whom the virus is\\r\\ndirectly communicated by the bite.\" The wounds considered most dangerous\\r\\nare the recent fresh wounds. The possibility of infection decreases with\\r\\nthe formation of the new connective tissue which protects the ends of the\\r\\nbroken nerve fibres. One must remember, however, that wounds over joints,\\r\\nespecially on the hands, are likely to remain open for some time. A dog\\r\\nill of this disease can give the disease to man through licking a wound.\\r\\nSuch a case has been recorded. This dog licked the child\\'s hands before it\\r\\nwas known to be mad. The child died from the disease. As stated before\\r\\nninety per cent of the cases are inoculated by the bites of rabid animals.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[INFECTIOUS DISEASES  243]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wounds are considered according to their severity and location.\\r\\nLacerating, tearing wounds upon uncovered surfaces, especially the head,\\r\\nare the most dangerous. This is due to the fact of the closeness of the\\r\\nbrain and the large amount of infection in such a wound, and for this\\r\\nreason treatment should be immediately given. But smaller wounds should\\r\\nalso be treated for the smallness of the wound furnishes no sure criterion\\r\\nas to the future outcome of the disease. All possible infections should be\\r\\nregarded as dangerous when considering the advisability of taking the\\r\\nPasteur Treatment. The small wound has usually a longer period of\\r\\nincubation, because of the small amount of infection, still it may cause a\\r\\nfatal termination. A dog never develops rabies from a lack of water or\\r\\nfrom being confined or overheated during the summer months. A spontaneous\\r\\ncase of rabies has never been known. It must be transmitted from animal to\\r\\nanimal and the history of the case will point to a previous infection by a\\r\\ndiseased animal.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhere rigid quarantine rules exist the disease does not occur. In\\r\\nAustralia they quarantine every dog, that comes to that country, for six\\r\\nmonths, and in consequence they have never had a case of rabies. In Russia\\r\\nthey have had many cases. In Constantinople the disease frequently \"runs\\r\\nriot.\" France has lost as many as 2,500 dogs in one year. Before the\\r\\nPasteur Treatment was instituted (in 1885) there was an average of sixty\\r\\ndeaths in human beings in the Paris hospitals.\\r\\n\\r\\nBelgium and Austria average one thousand dogs annually. There was a yearly\\r\\naverage in Germany of four hundred dogs, dying of rabies, until the law\\r\\nrequiring the muzzling of dogs was strictly enforced and since that time\\r\\nthe disease is practically unknown. We do not have strict quarantine laws\\r\\nagainst dogs, and the result is death from hydrophobia in many states\\r\\nannually. It was formerly believed that rabies was a hot weather disease.\\r\\nThe number of cases during the winter months of late years has disproved\\r\\nthat belief, for the records of the institute for treatment of hydrophobia\\r\\nat Ann Arbor have shown a decrease of cases during the summer months. This\\r\\nwas before 1908. This shows that rabies is not a hot weather disease.\\r\\n\\r\\n[244 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES ]\\r\\n\\r\\nOrdinarily cases of rabies occur here and there (sporadic), but if the\\r\\nconditions are favorable epidemics break out. One dog may bite several\\r\\ndogs and these dogs bite others and thus spread the disease to many. Not\\r\\nevery animal bitten by a mad dog develops the disease. The disease does\\r\\nnot always follow the bite. Only about forty per cent of all animals\\r\\nbitten by a mad dog contract the disease. This is given by a noted\\r\\nauthority. Statistics also show that in man the disease develops in only\\r\\nabout twenty per cent of the cases in those who have been bitten by rabid\\r\\ndogs. But in dealing with those who have been bitten such measures should\\r\\nbe taken as would be if they were certain of developing the disease; one\\r\\ncannot tell how much poison enters the system in such cases and preventive\\r\\nprocedures should be taken. There are reasons why everyone who is bitten\\r\\ndoes not contract the disease.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe location and character of the bite must be considered. Bites on the\\r\\nhead, neck and hands have been recognized as more dangerous, from early\\r\\ntimes, and such bites produce fatal results quicker than do bites on other\\r\\nparts of the body, and the reason is largely due to the fact that the\\r\\nother parts of the body are more or less protected by the clothing, and\\r\\nthis clothing prevents the entrance of so much poison into the system.\\r\\nBites on the head give a high mortality rate and are rapidly fatal. The\\r\\nclose proximity to the brain is one reason.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe part the clothing plays in protection is clearly shown by the\\r\\nfollowing quotation from an eminent authority: \"In India where the natives\\r\\ndress very scantily, the mortality was exceedingly high up to a few years\\r\\nago, at which time the British introduced the Pasteur laboratories. The\\r\\nclothing protects the body and it holds back the saliva and can be looked\\r\\nupon as a means of filtering the saliva of the rabid animal, most of the\\r\\nsaliva is held back as the teeth pierce the clothing, so that upon\\r\\nentering the flesh the teeth are practically dry, and only a portion of\\r\\nthe virus is introduced. Upon entering the wound this small amount of\\r\\nvirus is further diluted by the tissue juices to the non-infectious point.\\r\\nWe know from actual experimental work in the laboratory that the higher\\r\\ndilution will not kill.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIf a portion of the brain of an animal dead from street virus is taken and\\r\\nmade up in a dilution of one to five hundred, and this is injected, we\\r\\nfind that it does not produce death. But a dilution of one to three\\r\\nhundred will invariably kill. This is practically what very often happens\\r\\nwhen one is bitten through the clothing. The saliva may be filtered and\\r\\nheld back so that a small amount is introduced; perhaps a dilution of one\\r\\nto five hundred of the virus may get into the wound, but this is usually\\r\\nnot enough to cause the disease. There is no possible way of estimating\\r\\nthe amount of the inoculation. In such cases one\\'s chances of never\\r\\ncontracting the disease are only decreased; that is all we can say.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe treating of individuals, bitten by rabid animals, in the Pasteur\\r\\nInstitutes, is simply the practical application of results obtained by\\r\\nPasteur from his original work on rabies virus. Pasteur was a French\\r\\nchemist living in Paris, and he began his search for the cause and cure of\\r\\nrabies in 1880. He hoped to find a sure method of preventing the\\r\\ndevelopment of the dread disease, even if he could not find a cure for it\\r\\nafter it had developed. While he was pursuing this research Pasteur had\\r\\naccess to the cases of rabies in the Paris hospitals, and these numbered\\r\\nsixty each year. He had practically an unlimited supply, for France could\\r\\nfurnish him with twenty-five hundred more mad dogs, and a large number of\\r\\nother animals each year.\\r\\n\\r\\n[INFECTIOUS DISEASES 245]\\r\\n\\r\\nPasteur devoted the remainder of his life to the study of this subject. He\\r\\ncollected some saliva from the mouth of a child, on December 11, 1880, who\\r\\nhad died at the Hospital Trousseau four hours before. This saliva he\\r\\ndiluted with distilled water, and this mixture he injected into rabbits,\\r\\nand they all died, and the saliva taken from these rabbits when injected\\r\\ninto other rabbits caused their death with rabies. He found also that\\r\\nsaliva from rabid dogs almost always caused the disease. The incubation\\r\\nperiod varied within wide limits, and very often the animals lived. He\\r\\nthen used the blood of rabid dogs for inoculation, but these blood\\r\\ninoculations always failed to produce the disease. Pasteur was convinced\\r\\nafter careful study of rabid animals during the many months necessary to\\r\\ncomplete his experiments, that rabies was a disease of the nervous system,\\r\\nand that the poison (virus) was transmitted from the wound to the brain by\\r\\nthe way of the nerve trunks. Then to prove his theory Pasteur removed a\\r\\nportion of the brain of a dog that had died of rabies. A part of this was\\r\\nrubbed up in sterile water and used to inoculate other animals; and\\r\\nsubcutaneous inoculations with this material almost always produced death.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter this Pasteur tried a new method and injected directly into the\\r\\nnervous system, either into the nerve trunk or directly into the brain,\\r\\nafter trephining, and all such injections produced rabies in the injected\\r\\nanimal and death. He also found that rabbits inoculated in the brain\\r\\nalways died in the same length of time. When he injected into the nerve\\r\\ntrunk the inoculation period was longer, depending upon the distance from\\r\\nthe brain. Two problems now remained for Pasteur to solve, and these were,\\r\\nhow could he obtain the definite virulence and how could he reduce the\\r\\nvirulence regularly and gradually, so that it could be used by inoculation\\r\\nsafely as a vaccine to produce immunity to rabies in healthy animals, and\\r\\nalso to prevent the development of rabies in animals bitten by rabid\\r\\nanimals. He first tried successive inoculations. These inoculations were\\r\\nmade, after trephining, directly to the brain, and he used a portion of\\r\\nthe brain as a virus each time. He inoculated rabbit number one with a\\r\\nportion of brain taken from a rabid dog, and this rabbit died on the\\r\\nfifteenth day. He then inoculated rabbit number two with a portion of the\\r\\nbrain of rabbit number one; from the brain of rabbit number two the virus\\r\\nwas supplied for inoculating rabbit number three, and thus the brain of\\r\\neach inoculated rabbit was taken, after its death, for material to\\r\\ninoculate the next rabbit in the series. This experimentation showed him\\r\\nthat each rabbit in the series died a little sooner, showing that the\\r\\nvirus was becoming more virulent, till no increase in activity of the\\r\\npoison was shown after the fiftieth successive inoculation. \"Rabbits\\r\\ninoculated with a brain suspension of rabbit number fifty all died in\\r\\nseven days.\" This caused Pasteur to name the virus of number fifty \"virus\\r\\nfixe,\" a virus of definite length. He now had obtained a virus of definite\\r\\nstrength and the next question was, how could the virulence be gradually\\r\\nand definitely reduced.\\r\\n\\r\\n[246 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis he accomplished after many experiments. He proved that pieces of the\\r\\n\"medulla oblongata\" suspended in sterile tubes which contained fragments\\r\\nof caustic potash, steadily and gradually reduced their virulence as they\\r\\ndried, till the fourteenth day, when they were practically inert. New\\r\\nspecimens were prepared each day and cords which had dried in one day\\r\\nPasteur called \"one-day virus;\" cords which had dried in two days, \"two\\r\\nday\\'s virus,\" and so on up to the fourteenth day. With this graduated\\r\\nvirus he now experimented on dogs, and the injection he used on the first\\r\\nday consisted of an emulsion of fourteen-day virus; for the second day,\\r\\nthe thirteen-day virus, thus using a stronger virus each day, until on the\\r\\nfourteenth day he used the full strength virus. This treatment produced\\r\\nwhat is called immunity in the dog, and even the direct inoculation into\\r\\nthe brain of the strong virus would not produce death.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Pasteur had thoroughly satisfied himself by repeated trials, he\\r\\nannounced his wonderful discovery, and it was in 1886 that Pasteur\\r\\nconsidered the preventive inoculation in human beings as resting upon a\\r\\nsatisfactory experimental basis. During these five years this eminent man\\r\\nproved that it was possible to protect or immunize the lower animals,\\r\\nrabbits and dogs, against inoculation with the virulent virus.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe efficiency of this immunity was given trials by different methods of\\r\\ninoculation. It was found that sixty per cent of dogs inoculated under the\\r\\n\"dura\" (a membrane of the brain) were saved if treatment was given the\\r\\nsecond day. This test is more severe than is required to meet the ordinary\\r\\ninfection of rabies. Pasteur, after a series of these final tests were so\\r\\nconvincing, prescribed the preventive inoculations in human beings and on\\r\\nJuly 6th, 1886, the first human patient received the first treatment of\\r\\nhis series of inoculations.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe method of obtaining the attenuated virus used in the treatment is as\\r\\nfollows: A rabbit is inoculated by the brain method before described, each\\r\\nday, with suspension of the fresh, fixed virus. These rabbits die in six\\r\\ndays after the inoculation. In this way a rabbit dies each day; the spinal\\r\\ncord is removed, divided into sections, and suspended in a flask\\r\\ncontaining potassium hydrate. The action of potassium hydrate is drying\\r\\n(desiccating). A series of these cords, which have been hung on fourteen\\r\\nsuccessive days, are always kept in stock for the treatment of patients.\\r\\nThe virus becomes less active with each successive day of exposure to\\r\\ndrying (desiccation) and finally the virulence is altogether lost.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the patient comes for treatment the fourteenth and thirteenth-day\\r\\ncords are used for the first inoculation, and on each successive day the\\r\\npatient receives inoculation, the strength of which has been regulated by\\r\\nthe number of days the cord has been hanging. During the first four days\\r\\npatients receive injections of six cubic centimeters of emulsions made\\r\\nfrom cords aging from fourteen to seven days, and from the fifth day until\\r\\nthe completion of the course of treatment patients receive emulsions from\\r\\ncords of higher immunizing properties, but no cords desiccated for less\\r\\nthan four days are used.\\r\\n\\r\\n[INFECTIOUS DISEASES 247]\\r\\n\\r\\nDeath rate from 1878-1883 before Pasteur treatment was instituted taken\\r\\nfrom documents in the department of the Seine:\\r\\n\\r\\n    1878       143 bitten.     24 deaths.\\r\\n    1879       76    \"         12   \"\\r\\n    1880       68    \"          5   \"\\r\\n    1881      156    \"         22   \"\\r\\n    1882       67    \"         11   \"\\r\\n    1883       45    \"          6   \"\\r\\n\\r\\nAverage of one death to every six bitten, or seventeen per cent mortality.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIncubation period from eleven days to thirteen months, average one hundred\\r\\nand twenty days, depending upon location of bite. Pasteur Institute\\r\\nrecords during the years 1886-1887 and first half of 1888, show that\\r\\nPasteur had under his supervision 5,374 persons bitten by animals either\\r\\nproven or thought to have been mad. Mortality for 1886 was 1-34 per cent,\\r\\nduring 1887 it was 1-12 per cent, during 1888 it was 77/100 per cent. With\\r\\nthe later treatment the mortality has decreased to 3-10 per cent in 1908.\\r\\nThe Pasteur method of treatment is a process of immunization which must be\\r\\ncompleted before the development of the disease. It is of no value after\\r\\nthe symptoms have appeared.\\r\\n\\r\\nThose who have not been affected can be immunized the same as those who\\r\\nhave been bitten. The individual who has been bitten by a mad dog realizes\\r\\nwhen and how severely he has been bitten, and were it not for the\\r\\nso-called period of latent development of the virus, it would not be\\r\\npossible to carry out the Pasteur treatment. The patient may, if he will,\\r\\ntake advantage of this fact and be immunized by treatment before the\\r\\ndisease has developed. Deep and severe bites are most dangerous, but the\\r\\ndisease may develop simply from a rabid dog licking a scratch of the skin.\\r\\nAs before stated bites on exposed or uncovered surfaces, are more\\r\\ndangerous than those through clothing. There is a very easy access of the\\r\\nsaliva to the wound in the unprotected part, while in the protected parts\\r\\nthe teeth in passing through the protection, clothing, are freed of their\\r\\nsaliva at least partially. The virus is conveyed from the bitten part or\\r\\ninoculation to the central nervous system through the nerve trunk, and the\\r\\nrapidity of extension depends upon the resistant powers of the patient,\\r\\nthe virulence and the amount of virus deposited in the bitten part at the\\r\\ntime the person was bitten. This disease develops only in nerve tissues.\\r\\nVirus can be found in the nerves of the side bitten, while the\\r\\ncorresponding nerves on the opposite side are free from it. It can be\\r\\nascertained that the virus is present in the medulla oblongata before the\\r\\nlower portion of the cord.\\r\\n\\r\\n[248 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nComparative danger.--A wound of the hand after a delay of three weeks is\\r\\nas dangerous as a bite on the head exposed only a few days. There is\\r\\nalways a possibility of an accumulative action and extension of the virus\\r\\nalong the nerve trunk to the central nervous system during the interval of\\r\\nexposure, and this should be always borne in mind. It is stated by\\r\\nauthority that the virus is not transmitted by the bite of a rabid animal\\r\\nuntil two days previous to the appearance of the first symptoms. It is\\r\\nwith some difficulty that a decision is reached in advising patients who\\r\\nare bitten to take treatment early in the course of the disease. The\\r\\nsymptoms are often so very obscure and slight that they are not\\r\\nrecognized. If a dog which is not naturally vicious suddenly bites without\\r\\nany cause it should be tied securely and watched for seven days; and\\r\\nshould it develop symptoms of the disease during this period the bite\\r\\nshould be considered dangerous.\\r\\n\\r\\nImmediate treatment of the wound.--A temporary measure is the\\r\\ncauterization of the wound; do not neglect this because a few hours have\\r\\npassed since the person was bitten, for wounds may be cauterized with\\r\\nadvantage even after two or three days have elapsed. Of course the earlier\\r\\nit is done the better. If they are thoroughly laid open and scrubbed it is\\r\\nmore effective. Nitric acid used freely is the best method to use. Wash\\r\\nthe wound freely with boiled water after the acid has been applied;\\r\\nninety-five per cent carbolic acid may be used if nitric acid cannot be\\r\\nobtained.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf carbolic acid is used it is necessary that it be washed from the wound\\r\\nby the free use of absolute alcohol, followed by boiled water and a\\r\\ndressing of bichloride of 1-7000. This prevents the ulceration of the\\r\\nwound by the carbolic acid. Cauterization thoroughly done destroys a part\\r\\nof the inoculated virus. Thorough cauterization is especially necessary\\r\\nwith large wounds in which large quantities of the virus is inoculated.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen to send patients to an Institute.--Send them immediately, if there is\\r\\ngood reason to believe the animal had rabies. It is not wise to wait until\\r\\nthe animal dies; it is very important that treatment is begun as soon as\\r\\npossible, especially in severe bites.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat to send for examination.--The entire head may be sent by express, or\\r\\nbetter, the health officer should bring it in person. This saves time and\\r\\nrelieves anxiety; or a portion of the brain may be removed under\\r\\nthoroughly clean conditions and placed in a sterilized twenty per cent\\r\\nsolution of glycerin and water. In this way the virus retains its\\r\\nvirulence and putrefaction is diminished. The first method is the best,\\r\\ntaking the head directly. The head after it reaches the laboratory is\\r\\nexamined microscopically for \"negri bodies,\" and if there is no\\r\\ncontamination the microscopic findings are verified by animal\\r\\ninoculations. The presence of negri bodies in a specimen is of great value\\r\\nowing to the rapidity with which a diagnosis can be made. In one case a\\r\\npositive diagnosis was reported within twenty minutes after the specimen\\r\\nentered the laboratory and within the next hour and a half the patient\\r\\nbitten by the dog the same day had begun her course of protective\\r\\ninjections and was saved.\\r\\n\\r\\n[BLOOD AND DUCTLESS GLANDS  249]\\r\\n\\r\\nProtection.--To stamp out this disease city authorities, etc., can enact\\r\\nlaws.

Primary or essential anemia\\r\\nincludes chlorosis and pernicious anemia; secondary anemia results from\\r\\nhemorrhages, poor nourishment or intoxications, poisons. Chlorosis, a\\r\\nprimary anemia chiefly of young girls, characterized by marked relative\\r\\ndecrease of haemoglobin.\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses.--It usually occurs in blondes of from twelve to twenty years of\\r\\nage and most often from fourteen to seventeen years of age, when the\\r\\nmenstrual function is being established and during which time they are\\r\\nrushed with their school work. There may be a family history of chlorosis\\r\\nor tuberculosis. Poor food, hard, unhealthy work, confinement in close\\r\\nunventilated rooms are other causes.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--Rounded fleshy appearance may continue. There is some\\r\\ndifficulty of breathing, palpitation of the heart on slight exertion, from\\r\\na fright or from excitement, tendency to faint feeling or even fainting,\\r\\nheadache, a tired feeling, hard to stir or do anything, irritable temper,\\r\\npoor or changeable appetite, the digestion is disturbed, there is\\r\\nconstipation, coldness of the hands and feet, difficult menstruation,\\r\\nirregular menstruation, leucorrhea, amenorrhea, and sometimes there is a\\r\\nslight fever. The color is often of a yellowish-green tinge, and this is\\r\\nmore noticeable in the brunette type, though the cheeks may be flushed;\\r\\nthe whites of the eyes bluish white in color. The heart sounds are not\\r\\nright. The blood is pale in color. The red cells are diminished, but\\r\\nusually are not below eighty per cent of the normal; the haemoglobin is\\r\\ngreatly reduced, sometimes to thirty-five or forty per cent. The age,\\r\\ngreenish tint of pallor, bluish whites of the eyes, poor nutrition, etc.,\\r\\naid in making the diagnosis.\\r\\n\\r\\n[250 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--Fresh air, good food, care of the bowels and rest if the\\r\\nsymptoms are severe. When it is not so severe, plenty of outdoor exercise\\r\\nis necessary and beneficial. That takes them away from their cramped\\r\\nsedentary life and gives the sunshine, good pure air, and change of the\\r\\nscene. Horseback riding is a very good form of exercise, but it should be\\r\\nslow riding. \"Tending\" the horse is also good, and sleeping in the open\\r\\nair is excellent. Automobile riding is too straining and should not be\\r\\nindulged in.\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Blaud\\'s pills are very much used.

Take one to three pills, three\\r\\ntimes a day after meals.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Fowler\\'s solution of arsenic is also very good remedy; three to four\\r\\ndrops three times a day. It must be watched for bad symptoms and should\\r\\nonly be taken under a physician\\'s supervision.\\r\\n\\r\\nDiet.--This should be good and varied to suit the special taste, and as\\r\\nthe stomach and bowels are usually disordered such food should be chosen\\r\\nas will best agree. Diet plays a very important part.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPERNICIOUS ANAEMIA.--This is characterized by great decrease of the red\\r\\ncells of the blood with a relatively high color index and the presence of\\r\\nlarge number of germs. The causes are unknown.\\r\\n\\r\\nCondition.--The body is not emaciated. A lemon color of the skin is\\r\\nusually present. The muscles are a dark red, but all the other organs are\\r\\npale and fatty. The heart is large and fatty. The liver and spleen are\\r\\nnormal in size, or only slightly enlarged with an excess of iron in the\\r\\npigment. The red cells may fall to one-fifth or less of the normal number.\\r\\nThe rich properties of the blood are fearfully decreased.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--Stomach and bowels, dyspepsia, nausea and vomiting, or\\r\\nconstipation, may precede other symptoms or they may last throughout the\\r\\ncase. The onset is gradual and unknown, with gradually increasing weary\\r\\nfeeling, paleness and some difficulty in breathing and palpitation of the\\r\\nheart on exertion. There is paleness of the skin and the mucous membranes,\\r\\nthe lips look pale, no color. The paleness becomes extreme, the skin often\\r\\nhaving a lemon yellow tint. The muscles are flabby; the ankles are\\r\\nswollen, you can see the arteries beat. Hemorrhages may occur into the\\r\\nskin, mucous membrane and retina of the eye. Nervous symptoms are not\\r\\ncommon. The pallor and weakness become extreme, sometimes with intervals\\r\\nof improvement and death usually occurs. The following is Addison\\'s\\r\\ndescription given by Dr. Osler:\\r\\n\\r\\n[BLOOD AND DUCTLESS GLANDS 251]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt makes its approach in so slow and insidious a manner that the patient\\r\\ncan hardly fix a date to the earliest feeling of that languor which is\\r\\nshortly to become extreme. The countenance gets pale, and white of the\\r\\neyes become pearly, the general frame flabby rather than wasted. The pulse\\r\\nperhaps larger, but remarkably soft and compressible, and occasionally\\r\\nwith a slight jerk, especially under the slightest excitement. There is an\\r\\nincreasing indisposition to exertion, with an uncomfortable feeling of\\r\\nfaintness or breathlessness in attempting it; the heart is readily made to\\r\\npalpitate; the whole surface of the body presents a blanched, smooth and\\r\\nwaxy appearance; the lips, gums and tongue seem bloodless, the flabbiness\\r\\nof the solid increases, the appetite fails, extreme languor and faintness\\r\\nsupervene, breathlessness and palpitation are produced by the most\\r\\ntrifling exertion, or emotion; some slight oedema (swelling) is probably\\r\\nperceived about the ankles; the debility becomes extreme. The patient can\\r\\nno longer rise from the bed; the mind occasionally wanders; he falls into\\r\\na prostrate and half torpid state and at length expires; nevertheless, to\\r\\nthe very last, and after a sickness of several months\\' duration, the\\r\\nbulkiness of the general frame and the obesity (fat) often present a most\\r\\nstriking contrast to the failure and exhaustion observable in every other\\r\\nrespect. The disease is usually fatal.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--The patient should remain in bed and should use a light\\r\\nnourishing diet, taking food in small amounts and at stated intervals.\\r\\nRest in bed is essential. Dr. Osler treated a case in the following way: I\\r\\nusually begin with three minims (drops) of Fowler\\'s solution of arsenic\\r\\nthree times a day and increase the dose to five drops at the end of the\\r\\nfirst week; to ten at the end of the second week; to fifteen at the end of\\r\\nthe third week, and if necessary go up to twenty or twenty-five. Symptoms\\r\\nof an overdose are rare; vomiting and diarrhea occur. Then the medicine\\r\\nmust be discontinued for a few days.\\r\\n\\r\\nSECONDARY ANEMIA. Causes.--Hemorrhage form (bleeding). (a) Rapid bleeding\\r\\nfrom the rupture of an aneurism, from a blow, or eating into the blood\\r\\nvessels by an ulcer. (b) Slow bleeding as from nose-bleed, flow from the\\r\\nwomb, piles or in \"bleeders\" people who bleed readily.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Inanition form.--Not nourished because of interference in taking food\\r\\nor assimilating food, from cancer of the gullet, or disease of the\\r\\nstomach.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Toxic poison cases; from acute and chronic diseases, such as typhoid\\r\\nfever, tuberculosis, rheumatism, syphilis, malaria, nephritis; or chronic\\r\\nlead poisoning, mercury, arsenic, and copper poisoning.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--There is pallor, dizziness, headache, palpitation and dyspnoea,\\r\\ndifficult breathing on exertion; there is weakness, tendency to fainting,\\r\\npoor appetite, dyspepsia and constipation. The red blood cells are\\r\\ndiminished, also the haemoglobin. Death may occur from a single\\r\\nhemorrhage.\\r\\n\\r\\n[252 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--Remove the cause and rest. Good fresh air, good easily\\r\\ndigested food. The bowels must be kept regular. Iron and arsenic are good\\r\\nremedies if necessary. It is not possible to give special directions. A\\r\\nperson in this condition needs a good physician. There is no time to\\r\\nwaste. Iron and arsenic are good remedies, but they must be used\\r\\nintelligently and in proper doses. Blaud\\'s pill is good in some cases. It\\r\\ncontains iron. Also Fowler\\'s solution of arsenic.\\r\\n\\r\\nLEUKAEMIA.--An affection characterized by persistent increase in the white\\r\\nblood corpuscles, associated with changes, either alone or together, in\\r\\nthe spleen, lymphatic glands and bone-marrow.\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Spleen and Bone-Marrow, (Spleen-Medullary) type.--The changes are\\r\\nespecially localized in the spleen and in the bone-marrow while the blood\\r\\nshows a great increase in elements which are derived especially from the\\r\\nlatter tissue.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Lymphatic Type.--The changes in this type are chiefly localized in the\\r\\nlymphatic apparatus, the blood showing an especial increase in those\\r\\nelements derived from the lymph glands.\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses--Unknown. It is most common before middle age.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--Either type may be acute or chronic. The invasion may be\\r\\ngradual, sometimes with disturbance of the stomach and bowels, or\\r\\nnose-bleed. (a) The first type is the common one. The spleen generally\\r\\nbecomes enlarged; it is sometimes tender and painful, it may occupy over\\r\\nhalf of the abdominal cavity and varies in size after a hemorrhage,\\r\\ndiarrhea or after a meal. There may be paleness of the face, etc., early\\r\\nand late nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and dysentery are common, as is also\\r\\nascites (dropsy in the abdomen). The pulse is rapid, full and soft. Fever\\r\\nis usual. Hemorrhages occur in the skin, retina, pleura, peritoneum, etc.\\r\\nHeadache, dizziness, short breathing, and fainting may occur from the\\r\\nanemia. The liver may be enlarged. The blood shows a great increase in the\\r\\nwhite cells. Sometimes they are more numerous than the red blood cells.\\r\\n(b) Lymphatic type is rare, various groups of the lymph glands are\\r\\nenlarged, usually separate, but sometimes matted together; others, such as\\r\\nthe tonsils may become large. The blood shows an increase of the white\\r\\ncells, but less than in the other form. The spleen is usually somewhat\\r\\nenlarged. Recovery is rare; the lymphatic cases may last only six or eight\\r\\nweeks. The course is usually progressive for two or three years.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--The same as for Pernicious Anaemia.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFALSE LEUKAEMIA.  (Pseudo-Leukaemia).--Also called Hodgkin\\'s disease,\\r\\nmalignant lymphoma, and general lymphadenoma. This is a progressive anemia\\r\\nand enlargement of the lymph glands and the skin, with secondary lymphoid\\r\\ngrowth in the liver, spleen and other organs.\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses.--Males are more affected than females, and usually young persons.\\r\\nContinual local irritation causes a local enlargement of the gland, but\\r\\nthe actual cause is unknown.\\r\\n\\r\\n[BLOOD AND DUCTLESS GLANDS 253]\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--The lymph glands of the neck, arm-pit or groin are enlarged and\\r\\nwithout any pain, followed by anemia, loss of strength and slight fever.\\r\\nThe glands enlarge slowly or rapidly, forming large masses, while the\\r\\ngrowth extends to other regions. The spleen may be felt; the skin may be\\r\\nbronzed. In cases with involvement of deep seated nodes the first symptoms\\r\\nmay be those of pressure on blood vessels, nerves, trachea, bronchial\\r\\ntubes or other structures.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--Cut them out if they are small and localized. Arsenic,\\r\\nquinine, cod-liver oil are good medicines.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPURPURA.--This is not strictly a disease, but a symptom. This includes a\\r\\ngroup of affections characterized by hemorrhages into the skin.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--There are hemorrhages into the skin, and this takes the form of\\r\\nsmall blood spots underneath the skin, (petechia) and spots like the\\r\\nbursting of a blood vessel shows vibices or ecchymoses. The first are in\\r\\nsmall minute points and appear, as a rule, in the hair follicles and\\r\\nunlike the erythemas (redness) do not disappear upon pressure. Another\\r\\nkind occurs as streaks, while the ecchymoses are larger, but similar in\\r\\nnature to the first kind. They may be larger than a split pea, and they\\r\\nrange from a deep red to a livid bluish tint. They assume a yellowish\\r\\nbrown, then a yellow color, as they fade away and finally disappear. This\\r\\neruption appears in a series of crops and the legs are the usual seat.\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Symptomatic Purpura. (a) Infectious. Occurs in typhus fever,\\r\\nendocarditis, cerebro-spinal meningitis, typhoid fever, etc. (b) Toxic;\\r\\nfrom snake bites, iodide of potash, quinine, copaiba, bella donna, ergot,\\r\\netc., and with jaundice. (c) Cachectic; with cancer, tuberculosis,\\r\\nleukaemia, false leukaemia, scurvy, etc. (d) Neurotic; with hysteria,\\r\\nneuralgia, and some organic disease. (e) Mechanical; due to violent effort\\r\\nand poor venous circulation.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Type arthritic purpura. (a) Simple Purpura. A mild form usually\\r\\noccurring in children, sometimes with pains in the joints, rarely any\\r\\nfever. There is anemia, disturbance of the stomach and purpuric spots on\\r\\nthe legs, often on the arms and trunks. (b) Rheumatic purpura; this\\r\\nusually occurs in men from twenty to forty years old. There is usually\\r\\npain and swelling of several joints, temperature 101 to 103 degrees,\\r\\npurpuric eruption chiefly on the legs and about the affected joints, often\\r\\nwith hives and digestive disturbances: (c) Henoch\\'s purpura; usually in\\r\\nchildren and is sometimes fatal. There are recurrent joint pains and\\r\\nswelling, disturbances of the stomach and bowels, skin troubles resembling\\r\\nit, and hemorrhage from mucous membrane.\\r\\n\\r\\n[254 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPURPURA HAEMORRHAGIC.--This is a severe form, usually seen in delicate\\r\\ngirls. The cause is unknown.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--Weakness, extensive purpuric spots (small blood spots in the\\r\\nskin), eruption, hemorrhages from the mucous membranes which may cause\\r\\nsecondary anemia, slight fever, slow clotting of the blood. The duration\\r\\nis from ten to fourteen days. Death may occur within a day in cases marked\\r\\nby profuse bleedings into the skin and prostration.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--Remove the causes. Fresh air, food and tonics, etc. This\\r\\ndisease is serious and needs careful treatment from a physician.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHAEMOPHILIA. \"Bleeders.\"--This is a hereditary disorder characterized by a\\r\\ntendency to persistent bleeding, spontaneously or even after a slight\\r\\ninjury.\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses.--Usually hereditary through many generations. It is transmitted\\r\\nthrough daughters, themselves usually not \"bleeders,\" to their male\\r\\nchildren. It is found most often in the Anglo-German races.\\r\\n\\r\\nCondition.--The blood vessel walls are thin; the skin is delicate,\\r\\nclotting of the blood is usually retarded.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--It comes spontaneously or after only slight wounds; the person\\r\\nis extremely delicate. The bleedings occur from the skin, or mucous\\r\\nmembrane, or from wounds, but rarely during menstruation or confinement.\\r\\nThey vary from small spots to bleeding which may end fatally, or in\\r\\nrecovery with marked anemia. There may be pain and swelling of the joints,\\r\\netc., and this may leave deformities resembling deformed arthritis. The\\r\\nresult is worse the earlier the disease shows itself. They may live to old\\r\\nage.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--Avoid, as much as possible, wounds and operations in\\r\\n\"bleeding\" families. Marriage of the women should be discouraged. For\\r\\nbleeding: rest, ice, tannic or gallic acid or adrenalin locally if the\\r\\nbleeding points can be reached. Plug the nostrils for nose-bleed both\\r\\nbehind and in front.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSCURVY. (Scorbutus).--A constitutional disease characterized by weakness,\\r\\nanemia, sponginess of the gums and tendencies to bleeding.\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses.--This disease has been called \"The calamity of sailors.\" It has\\r\\nbeen known from the earliest times, and has prevailed particularly in\\r\\narmies in the field and among sailors on long voyages. It has become a\\r\\nvery rare disease in the United States.\\r\\n\\r\\nPredisposing Causes.--Overcrowding; dark unhealthy rooms; prolonged\\r\\nfatigue; mental depression.\\r\\n\\r\\nExciting Cause.--The lack of fresh vegetables, poisoning from slightly\\r\\ntainted food, or an infection. The gums are swollen, sometimes ulcerated,\\r\\nskin is spotted, bluish, etc,\\r\\n\\r\\n[BLOOD AND DUCTLESS GLANDS 255]\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--It comes on gradually (insidiously). There is loss of weight,\\r\\nprogressively developing weakness and pallor, very soon the gums are\\r\\nswollen and look spongy and bleed easily. The teeth may become loose and\\r\\nfall out. The breath is very foul. The tongue is swollen, but it may be\\r\\nred and not coated. The skin becomes dry and rough and (ecchymoses) dark\\r\\nspots soon appear, first on the legs, and then on the arm and trunk and\\r\\nparticularly about the hair follicles. These are spontaneous or follow a\\r\\nslight injury. In severe cases hemorrhages under the periosteum (the\\r\\ncovering of the bones) may cause irregular swelling, especially in the\\r\\nlegs, and these may break down and form ulcers. The slightest bruise or\\r\\ninjury causes hemorrhages into the injured part. Extravasion under the\\r\\nskin, especially in the lower extremities may be followed by permanent\\r\\nhardness (induration) and stiffness due to connective tissue infiltration\\r\\n(scurvy sclerosis). There may be pains in the joints and often watery\\r\\nswelling (oedema) of the ankles. Bleeding from internal mucous membranes\\r\\nis less common than from the skin. The appetite is poor, palpitation of\\r\\nthe heart and feebleness and irregularity of the pulse are prominent\\r\\nsymptoms. Owing to the sore gums the patient is unable to chew the food.\\r\\nThe urine often contains albumin and is scanty and concentrated. There are\\r\\nweariness, depression, headache and finally delirium or coma, or symptoms\\r\\ndue to hemorrhages within the brain; or day and night blindness may be\\r\\npresent.\\r\\n\\r\\nRecovery.--The patient will recover if the cause can be removed, unless it\\r\\nis far advanced. Death may result from complications.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment. Preventive.--Fresh or canned vegetables or fruit must be eaten.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment for the attack.--Dr. Osler, of England, says: \"I think the juice\\r\\nof two or three lemons daily and a diet of plenty of meat and fresh\\r\\nvegetables will cure all cases unless they are far advanced. For the\\r\\nstomach small quantities of scraped meat and milk should be given at short\\r\\nintervals, and the lemon juice in gradually increasing quantities. As the\\r\\npatient gains in strength you can give a more liberal diet, and he may eat\\r\\nfreely of potatoes, cabbage, water cresses, and lettuce. A bitter tonic\\r\\nmay be given. Permanganate of potash or dilute carbolic acid forms the\\r\\nbest mouth-wash. Penciling the swollen gums with a tolerably strong\\r\\nsolution of nitrate of silver is very useful. Relieve the constipation by\\r\\nenemas.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nADDISON\\'S DISEASE. Diseases of the Suprarenal (above Kidneys) Bodies.--A\\r\\nconstitutional disease characterized by great weakness, stomach and bowel\\r\\nsymptoms, heart weakness, and dark coloring of the skin.\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses.--It usually occurs in men from twenty to forty years old. The skin\\r\\nand mucous membrane and sometimes the serous, like the pleura, etc.,\\r\\nmembranes are pigmented (darkened).\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--There is a gradual onset of weakness, changeable symptoms in\\r\\nthe stomach and bowels and darkening of the skin. There is great feeling\\r\\nof fatigue and feeble irregular action of the heart; nausea and vomiting\\r\\nand often absence of appetite and some diarrhea. The abdomen may be\\r\\npainful and drawn back in the course of the disease. The pigmentation\\r\\n(coloring of the skin) varies from the light yellow to dark brown, olive\\r\\nor black. It usually begins on the skin or regions naturally pigmented; or\\r\\nwhere pressure is exerted by the clothing. The mucous membranes are also\\r\\npigmented. Death may occur from fainting, extreme weakness, convulsions or\\r\\ndelirium or through tuberculosis. Usually death occurs within one year,\\r\\nthough this may occur in a few weeks to two years, sometimes after\\r\\nintervals of improvement.\\r\\n\\r\\n[256 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--This must be to meet the indications as they arise. It is a\\r\\nserious disease and should be under the supervision of a competent\\r\\nphysician.\\r\\n\\r\\nDISEASES OF THE SPLEEN. 1. Rupture of the spleen.--This may occur\\r\\nspontaneously from no apparent cause, or from hurts received in cases of\\r\\ntyphoid or malaria.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--Severe pain, and signs of intestinal hemorrhages.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Acute inflammation of the spleen (splenitis).--This occurs in acute\\r\\ninfections after injuries.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--They are pain, tenderness, and enlargement of the spleen.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--Treat the cause and relieve the pain. As this is a serious and\\r\\npainful affection a physician should be called. The pain is often relieved\\r\\nby a mustard poultice or hot fomentations. The patient should remain in\\r\\nbed for acute inflammation of the spleen no matter what the cause.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Chronic Splenitis. Causes.--It comes from malaria, syphilis or\\r\\nleukaemia, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--There is the feeling of weight and symptoms of pressure on the\\r\\nlungs or bowel.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--Remove the cause. If it comes from malaria, attend to that,\\r\\netc.\\r\\n\\r\\nMOTHERS\\' REMEDIES. 1.

Blood Purifier, Sweet Fern for.--\"Make a tea of this and drink freely.\\r\\nThis is very good to take in the spring of the year, as it thoroughly\\r\\ncleanses the system.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n5. Blood Purifier, Doctor Recommends Senna and Salts for:--\"Five cents\\'\\r\\nworth of senna leaves, one tablespoonful of epsom salts in one quart of\\r\\ncold water; cover and let stand over night, then strain and put in\\r\\nbottles. Take a wine-glass full every morning until you feel well.\" This\\r\\nis from Mrs. Jonathan Shaw, she has used it with good results in her\\r\\nfamily. A physician in England told her if people would use this the year\\r\\nround they would seldom need a doctor.\\r\\n\\r\\n6. Blood Purifier, Remedy Easy to Make for.--\"We always use one\\r\\nteaspoonful of cream of tartar, two spoonfuls of sulphur, and mix with\\r\\nsyrup. Any size spoon will do. Take a teaspoonful at a dose.\" This is an\\r\\nexcellent remedy, and should be taken before retiring; about three times a\\r\\nweek would be sufficient.\\r\\n\\r\\n7. Blood Purifier, Beech Bark and Blackberry Root a Good.--\"One gallon\\r\\nwhite beech bark (after the rough bark is removed), good big handful of\\r\\nblackberry root (cut fine), and also of sassafras root. Cover with cold\\r\\nwater and steep to get the strength, then strain. When cool (not cold) add\\r\\none pint baker\\'s yeast and one cup sugar. Let it stand twenty-four hours\\r\\nin a warm place.

It\\r\\nmay develop in a patient with goitre, or acute infectious diseases, or\\r\\nfrom other parts, or from wounds. The gland is enlarged and soft and may\\r\\ncontain abscesses.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--Pain, tenderness, and enlargement of the part or of all the\\r\\ngland. Fever may be present even in cases without signs of pus forming\\r\\n(suppuration). If there is great enlargement, there may be symptoms of\\r\\ncompression of vessel, nerves or the windpipe.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--If there is pus it must be carefully opened. The patient must\\r\\nremain quiet in bed. Sometimes cold applications relieve. Do not use warm\\r\\napplications. This disease is not frequent and the patient needs care and\\r\\nwatching more than medicine.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGOITRE (BRONCHIAL). Causes.--No satisfactory explanation can be given for\\r\\nthis disease. It seems to be more prevalent where lime-stone water is\\r\\nused. Heredity plays a part. This is an enlargement of the thyroid gland.\\r\\nChronic enlargement of the thyroid is sporadic. Cases are scattered and\\r\\nendemic in certain mountainous regions. It affects young women most often.\\r\\nA great excess in lime drinking water may be the cause. It is very\\r\\nprevalent about the eastern shore of Lake Ontario and in parts of\\r\\nMichigan. It is a common complaint in this country.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--There is a gradual painless enlargement of the whole gland or\\r\\none lobe, etc. It may press on the windpipe, and cause difficult\\r\\nbreathing, also on the blood vessels and nerves.\\r\\n\\r\\nRecovery.--This is usually favorable as to life, but not so favorable as a\\r\\ncure. It becomes chronic. A sudden fatal ending may come.\\r\\n\\r\\nGOITRE, MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES,--1.

Goitre, Simple Remedy for.--\"Wring a cloth from cold water and bind it\\r\\naround the neck every night when retiring. This is a sure cure if\\r\\ncontinued for some time.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Goitre, Inexpensive Remedy for--\"Apply the following several times a\\r\\nday: Extract of belladonna one-half dram, compound ointment of iodine two\\r\\ndrams; this treatment must be kept up several months.\" The above treatment\\r\\nwill be found very beneficial and is not an expensive one.\\r\\n\\r\\nPHYSICIANS\\' TREATMENT for Goitre.--1. Locally tincture of iodine; paint\\r\\nsome on the gland once or twice a day until it gets a little sore and keep\\r\\nit so for weeks, or use cosmoline and put in it about one-quarter as much\\r\\niodine and rub on. Lard will do instead of cosmoline. The parts should be\\r\\nkept red and a little sore. Use also iodide of potash, five grains, three\\r\\ntimes a day internally, while you are using external applications.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Use the compound of tincture of iodine the same way, externally. This\\r\\nis not so strong and can be used longer with, I think, better results. At\\r\\nthe same time you may use this same medicine internally. Take one to two\\r\\ndrops internally three times a day; or you may take five grains of iodide\\r\\nof potash three times a day instead. Externally: These applications must\\r\\nproduce a little redness and be continued for some time.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. An Ointment. The red iodide of mercury is also good to rub on the part.\\r\\nThis may be used if the others fail.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Other medical remedies are used, but they must be closely watched and\\r\\nmust be used under the supervision of a doctor. The thymus or thyroid\\r\\nextracts are thus used and with good results in many cases.\\r\\n\\r\\n5. Colorless Iodine: This does not stain, but I have no faith in it. It is\\r\\nused very much now and can be used freely. It is simply, druggists tell\\r\\nme, iodide of potash made in solution, dissolved, and put on the part. A\\r\\ngreat many cases of large goitres are now being operated upon with quite\\r\\ngood success. It is not done until other measures have failed, unless the\\r\\ngoitre is interfering with breathing and the blood supply.\\r\\n\\r\\n6. This is very good, both for internal and external use.\\r\\n\\r\\n    Iodide of Potash     20 drams\\r\\n    Iodine                1 dram\\r\\n    Water enough for      3 ounces\\r\\n\\r\\nMix thoroughly and shake bottle before using.\\r\\n\\r\\nPut some in two bottles; one for internal and other for external use.

(Parry\\'s, Graves or Basedows Disease).--It is\\r\\ncharacterized by exophthalmos (bulging of the eyes), Goitre, fast beating\\r\\nof the heart, trembling and nervousness.\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses.--It is most common in women from twenty to thirty. Several cases\\r\\nmay occur in the same family. The exact cause is unknown.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--Acute cases. Sudden onset, vomiting, diarrhea, the heart beats\\r\\nfast with throbbing arteries, bulging of the eyes, enlarged thyroid gland.\\r\\nDeath may occur in a few days.\\r\\n\\r\\nChronic Cases.--There is usually a gradual onset of tachy cardia,--fast\\r\\nbeating of the heart,--pulse being 100 to 180 or more, if excited. Later\\r\\nthere are throbbing of the arteries and of the thyroid glands.\\r\\n\\r\\nBulging of the eyeball is sometimes extreme. There may be fever and\\r\\nusually is anemia, emaciation, weakness, nervousness, perspiration,\\r\\ndifficult breathing, dark color of the skin. It usually lasts several\\r\\nyears. Spontaneous recovery may occur in six months to a year and is not\\r\\ncommon. Recovery is rare in advanced cases.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--Prolonged rest in bed, with an ice bag constantly over the\\r\\nheart, or better over the lower part of the neck and upper breast bone.\\r\\nAvoid all worry and excitement.

The thyroid extract has been used.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMYXOEDEMA.--This is a constitutional disease due to atrophy (wasting away)\\r\\nof the thyroid gland and characterized by swollen condition of the tissue\\r\\nunder the skin, wasting of the thyroid and mental failures. Three forms\\r\\nexist, myxoedema proper, cretinism and operative myxoedcma.\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses of Cretinism.--This may exist at birth (congenital) or it may\\r\\ndevelop at puberty, and is due to the absence or loss of function of the\\r\\nthyroid gland. Sporadic (here and there) cretinism may follow an acute\\r\\ninfectious disease or it may be congenital. Myxoedema may be hereditary\\r\\nand is most common in women.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms, (a) Cretinism.--Mental and bodily development is slow.

The face is broad, with\\r\\ncoarse features, the nose is broad and thick, the mouth is large, lips\\r\\nthick, hair scanty and coarse, slowness of motion and thought, weak\\r\\nmemory, irritability, headache, suspiciousness, followed sometimes by\\r\\nhallucinations, delusion and dementia (insane). The disease may progress\\r\\nfor ten or fifteen years. Death may occur early.\\r\\n\\r\\nOperative type.--This rarely develops except the thyroid glands have been\\r\\nentirely removed and then only if no extra glands are present.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--Are the same as that of cretinism.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--An even, warm climate. Thyroid extract, to be given by a\\r\\nphysician, is the remedy. After the recovery occasional small doses still\\r\\nmay be necessary for some, or in cretinism for life.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDISEASES OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNEURALGIA.--Pain occurring in the course of the nerves and in their area\\r\\nof distribution. The pain has remission and intermissions, and is due to\\r\\nsome morbid affection of the nerves of sensation or their spinal or\\r\\n(brain) centers.\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses.--The affection may depend upon some functional disturbance alone;\\r\\nor it may be due to some organic disease of the nerve or to some disease\\r\\nor diseased state outside of the nervous system. It occurs more frequently\\r\\nin women past the middle-age, in those of a nervous tendency. As stated,\\r\\nit affects women more than men. Debility is a frequent cause. Neuralgia is\\r\\nfrequently associated with the various forms of anemia. It may occur at\\r\\nthe onset of acute diseases like typhoid fever. Exposure to cold causes it\\r\\nin susceptible persons. Decayed teeth may cause neuralgia of the fifth\\r\\nnerve. It also occurs in rheumatism, gout, lead poisoning, and diabetes.\\r\\nPersistent neuralgia may be a feature of hidden Bright\\'s disease.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--Pain is the chief and characteristic symptom. It may develop\\r\\nsuddenly and without warning, or soreness or stiffness in the tissues\\r\\nsurrounding may precede it. There is a burning or violent sensation in the\\r\\ncourse of the affected nerve, increased on exertion in acute cases. In\\r\\nother cases the pain comes intermittently or in paroxysms, and is of a\\r\\ndarting, stabbing character, or accompanied by tingling sensations. There\\r\\nmay be a want of sensation of the skin in the affected region or\\r\\nover-sensitiveness over the entire nerve-trunk with certain painful\\r\\npoints. The attacks of pain may come only at long intervals of time, but\\r\\nusually they occur every few minutes and last for some hours. Pain may be\\r\\ncontinued for hours or days in severe cases. In rare cases it may persist\\r\\nfor months or years, being worse at a certain time each day, especially in\\r\\ncases where malaria exists. There is paleness or congestion of the part\\r\\naffected, various eruptions, and changes in the color of the hair occur\\r\\nand, in advanced chronic cases, symptoms of interference with the general\\r\\nnutrition also occur. Spasms of the adjacent muscles may accompany the\\r\\nsevere paroxysms.\\r\\n\\r\\n[262 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: The Nervous System.]\\r\\n\\r\\n[NERVOUS SYSTEM 263]\\r\\n\\r\\nVarieties.--Neuralgia may be classified according to its causes, as\\r\\nneurotic, toxic, rheumatic, etc.; or according to its location as\\r\\ntrifacial, intercostal, sciatic, and so on, Exposure to cold, mechanical\\r\\nirritations, tumors, pressure on the nerves, and wounds may lead to\\r\\nneuralgia. It is more frequent in cold and damp climates than in dry and\\r\\nwarm locations; everyone should remember the causes.\\r\\n\\r\\nMOTHERS\\' REMEDIES. Neuralgia.--1. Lemon Juice as Liniment for.--\"Cut a\\r\\nlemon in two and squeeze juice on parts afflicted and rub in, then place\\r\\nhot cloths over it. I know this will cure the pain.\" This is very good.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Neuralgia, Salt and Vinegar Will Relieve.--\"A small sack of hot salt\\r\\napplied to the pain, or steam with vinegar.\" The heat from the salt is\\r\\nvery effective and the moisture of the vinegar is also very good. This\\r\\nsimply produces a counter irritation.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Neuralgia, Quinine Will Cure.--\"Use quinine three times a day.\" It is\\r\\nwell in taking quinine to take two grains three times a day for two days,\\r\\nthen take some good cathartic, so as not allow the quinine to remain in\\r\\nthe system. This is very beneficial, especially when neuralgia is due to\\r\\nmalarial conditions.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Neuralgia, Four Ingredient Remedy for.--\\r\\n\\r\\n    \"Oil of Peppermint        1 ounce\\r\\n    Oil of Mustard (strong)  1/4 ounce\\r\\n    Vinegar                    1 pint\\r\\n    White of one egg.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeat egg and stir all together.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n5.

Neuralgia, Menthol Liniment for.--\"One dram of menthol liniment, two\\r\\nounces of alcohol. This makes a very excellent liniment for many purposes.\\r\\nFor rheumatism, neuralgia, headache, etc.\" This liniment will be found\\r\\nvery beneficial as the menthol is soothing and quieting, and we all know\\r\\nthat alcohol is very good to be applied for any of the above mentioned\\r\\ndiseases.\\r\\n\\r\\n7. Neuralgia, Belladonna Plaster for.--\"Melt three ounces of rosin plaster\\r\\nand add one-half ounce of extract of belladonna. An excellent application\\r\\nin neuralgia and rheumatism.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n[264 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nPHYSICIANS\\' GENERAL TREATMENT for Neuralgia.--Remove the cause if\\r\\npossible. If from anemia, give tonics for that and try to cure that\\r\\ndisease. Tonics with good nourishing food, and proper surroundings are\\r\\nneeded for anemia. In malaria, syphilitic or gouty patients,\\r\\nconstitutional treatment must be given for those diseases before the\\r\\nneuralgia will be better. The systematic use of galvanic electricity,\\r\\nproperly used, is the most valuable means at the physician\\'s disposal,\\r\\nespecially in the descending current, beginning with the mild current and\\r\\ngradually increasing in strength. Internally: Arsenic, bromine, ergotinc,\\r\\naconite, gelsemium, valerian, ether, cannabis indica and quinine are\\r\\nrecommended. Opium may be used in the very severe forms, but it must be\\r\\nused with caution, or you will make your patient a drug fiend, and his\\r\\nlatter state will be worse than the first condition. Wet compresses, vapor\\r\\nbaths, cold affusions, wet cloths, are highly recommended.\\r\\n\\r\\n1. For the Cure of an Attack--\\r\\n\\r\\n    Antipyrine             30 grains\\r\\n    Citrate of Caffeine    20 grains\\r\\n\\r\\nMake into ten powders. Take one everyone-half hour until 3 doses are\\r\\ntaken. Three (3) doses at least should relieve the neuralgia.\\r\\n\\r\\n2.  Antipyrine         30 to 60 grams\\r\\n    Bromide of Potash         3 drams\\r\\n\\r\\nMix: and make into ten powders; one every thirty minutes until relieved or\\r\\nuntil six doses have been taken; this is better than the first\\r\\nprescription when there is much nervousness with the neuralgia or\\r\\nneuralgic headaches.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. If caffeine in first prescription causes nervousness, give this one:\\r\\n\\r\\n    Antipyrine           30 to 60 grains\\r\\n    Citrate of Caffeine        10 grains\\r\\n    Bromide of Potash           3 drams\\r\\n\\r\\nMix and make ten powders. Take one every half hour until relieved or until\\r\\nsix doses have been used.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese are very effective prescriptions, but if a person has any heart\\r\\ntrouble I would not advise their use except under a physician\\'s care.\\r\\n(Sometimes a patient with neuralgia gets desperate, and he will even\\r\\nresort to morphine). Antipyrine is one of the simplest coal tar remedies,\\r\\nand most persons can safely take it. Persons who are subject to neuralgia\\r\\nor headaches need to take good care of themselves. Get plenty of rest and\\r\\nsleep. Neuralgia at first can be cured, but when it once becomes chronic,\\r\\nespecially neuralgia of the face, it is hard to cure and frequently makes\\r\\nlife a constant misery. Plenty of outdoor life is essential. In that way\\r\\nthe system will be built up, and when the body is strong the disease can\\r\\nbe thrown off much easier. A great many people depend too much upon strong\\r\\nmedicines. Medicines are all right in their place, but all the medicine in\\r\\nthe world cannot cure a person unless that person does his or her part.\\r\\n\\r\\n[NERVOUS SYSTEM 265]\\r\\n\\r\\nSPECIAL DISEASES. Facial Neuralgia. (Neuralgia of the fifth pair of\\r\\nCranial Nerves. Also known as Trifacial Neuralgia. Neuralgia of the\\r\\nTrigeminus. Tic doloureux, etc.).--This form is more frequent than all\\r\\nother forms combined, this nerve being peculiarly susceptible to\\r\\nfunctional and organic disorders. All three branches are very rarely\\r\\naffected together, the ophthalmic (eye) branch being most often involved.\\r\\nThe symptoms depend upon the branch involved.\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Ophthalmic Neuralgia Pain, (eye neuralgia pain).--This pain is above\\r\\nthe eye, or frontal kind, with a special painful point at the supraorbital\\r\\n(above the eye) notch. Sometimes the pain is very severe in the eye-ball.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Supramaxillary Neuralgia.--In this the pain is along the infraorbital\\r\\n(nerve beneath the eye) nerve, and there is a marked tender point at the\\r\\nopening in the bone (infraorbital foramen) beneath the eye. A\\r\\ntoothache-like pain in the upper teeth is common in this variety.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Inframaxillary (lower maxillary) Neuralgia.--This is characterized by a\\r\\nscattered (diffused) pain along the inferior dental (teeth) branch, and\\r\\nextends from the temporal (side forehead) region over the side of the face\\r\\nto the chin, with pain in the lower teeth and side of the tongue. The pain\\r\\nin this nerve may come on without any special cause, or it may come after\\r\\nexcitement of a physical or mental nature. Disorders of nutrition occur.\\r\\nThe circulation is interfered with and the face, at first pale, becomes\\r\\nred. Eruptions may appear along the course of the nerve, while salivation\\r\\nand \"running\" (lachrymation) of the eyes are often prominent symptoms.\\r\\nSpasms of muscles of the face (tic doloureux) may accompany the paroxysms\\r\\nand this is the most terrible form of nerve pain. The attacks may be mild\\r\\nor very severe and sometimes sudden. This is a terrible disease,\\r\\nespecially when it has existed for some time. A person with severe pain in\\r\\nthe face should always attend to it immediately, before it becomes\\r\\nchronic.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--It is directed towards removing the cause, if possible.\\r\\nChronic cases are difficult to cure. The patient should be careful not to\\r\\ntake cold, keep strong and healthy by regular hours for sleep, good\\r\\nsufficient clothing. The general health must be improved. These directions\\r\\napply to all kinds of neuralgia.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nINTERCOSTAL NEURALGIA.--A neuralgia of one or more of the intercostal\\r\\nnerves. These nerves run in a groove in the lower edge of the ribs.\\r\\nCauses.--It may develop without any special cause. It comes in anemia,\\r\\nafter exposure to cold, from affection of the vertebrae, ribs, spinal\\r\\ncord, or from the pressure of tumors, or aneurism of the aorta. This is\\r\\nnext in importance to neuralgia of the fifth nerve, and occurs more often\\r\\nin women and very common in those who have hysteria. It is more common on\\r\\nthe left side and mostly in the nerves situated from the fifth to the\\r\\nninth intercostal space. If it is located in the nerves distributed to the\\r\\nmammary glands it gives rise to neuralgia of the mammary gland. The flying\\r\\ndarts of pain in the chest (pleurodynia) are to be regarded as neuralgic\\r\\nin character.\\r\\n\\r\\n[266 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--The pain is usually very severe, especially on movement of the\\r\\nintercostal (between the ribs) muscles. With this pain, as a rule, an\\r\\neruption (herpes) appears along the course of the affected nerve and this\\r\\nis supposed to be due to the extension of the inflammation from the\\r\\nnerve-ends to the skin. Pain, when pressed upon, is most marked near the\\r\\nspinal vertebral, the breastbone (sternal) end and the middle part of the\\r\\nnerve. The trouble may continue a long time after the eruption (herpes)\\r\\nhas disappeared, for it is very obstinate.\\r\\n\\r\\nPHYSICIANS\\' TREATMENT for Intercostal Neuralgia.--This consists in using\\r\\nremedies that will cause counter-irritation. Electricity and pain\\r\\ndestroying (anodynes) remedies are indicated in chronic cases. Apply heat\\r\\nfor pain in the \"breasts.\" For the eruption an ointment like oxide of zinc\\r\\ncan be used.\\r\\n\\r\\nLocal Treatment.--A mustard plaster is frequently good to use. It produces\\r\\nthe counter-irritation desired. Application of dry heat from hot cloths; a\\r\\nhot sand bag may help in some cases. A rubber bag containing hot water can\\r\\nalso be used. Fomentations of hops, etc., applied hot and frequently\\r\\nchanged to keep them hot are beneficial in some cases. I have found in\\r\\nsome cases that an adhesive plaster put over the sore parts relieves the\\r\\nsevere pain. Porous plasters are also good. Tincture of ranunculus\\r\\nbulbosus (buttercup) is a good remedy. Put ten drops in a glass half full\\r\\nof water, and take two teaspoonfuls every hour.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Sciatic Nerve.]\\r\\n\\r\\nSCIATICA.--This is as a rule a neuritis of the sciatic nerve or of its\\r\\ncords of origin. It is characterized by pain chiefly along the course of\\r\\nthe sciatic nerve.\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses.--It occurs most commonly in adult males. The person may have a\\r\\nhistory of rheumatism or gout in many cases. Exposure to cold after heavy\\r\\nmuscular work or exertion, or a severe wetting are common causes. The\\r\\nnerves in the pelvis may be compressed by large tumors of the ovaries or\\r\\nwomb, by other tumors, or by the child\\'s head during confinement.\\r\\nOccasionally hip joint disease causes it. The nerve, as a rule, is\\r\\nswollen, reddened, and in a condition of \"interstitial neuritis.\" The pain\\r\\nmay be most severe where the nerves emerge from the hip bone, behind, or\\r\\nin the inner back, and middle part of the thigh.\\r\\n\\r\\n      NERVOUS SYSTEM       267\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--Pain is the most constant and troublesome. It is sometimes very\\r\\nsevere. The onset is usually gradual, and for a time there is only a\\r\\nslight pain in the back of the thigh; soon the pain becomes more intense,\\r\\nextends down the thighs, and leg and reaches to different parts of the\\r\\nfoot. The very sensitive spots can often be pointed out by the patient,\\r\\nand on pressure these spots are very painful.  It is gnawing and burning\\r\\nin character, usually constant, but sometimes it comes in paroxysms, and\\r\\nis often worse at night. Walking usually causes great pain. The knee is\\r\\nbent and the patient treads on his toes. As a rule it is an obstinate\\r\\ntrouble, and it may last for months, or even with slight remissions for\\r\\nyears. In the severer forms the patient must remain in bed and such cases\\r\\nare very trying for both patient and doctor.\\r\\n\\r\\n(See Mothers\\' Remedies under Neuralgia above).\\r\\n\\r\\nPHYSICIANS\\' TREATMENT. Cautions for Sciatica.--Remove all causes if you\\r\\ncan. Rheumatism and gout, if the patient have them, should be treated. The\\r\\npatient should not overwork or expose himself to wet, damp weather. Keep\\r\\nevery part dry. Rest in bed with the whole leg fixed is a valuable mode of\\r\\ntreatment in many cases. Hot water bags from the hip to the knee placed\\r\\nalong the painful nerve, sometimes gives great relief. Mud baths are\\r\\nbeneficial. Hot Springs baths relieve many cases. Fly blisters placed\\r\\nalong the track of the nerve relieve the pain in many cases. Fomentations\\r\\nof smartweed and hops are good, but they must be changed often so as to be\\r\\nhot. Wet or dry cupping is a help in many cases. It draws the blood from\\r\\nthe inflamed nerve. Morphine given hypodermically will relieve the pain,\\r\\nbut it is a dangerous medicine to use in a chronic case. The patient will\\r\\nbe very likely to form the habit, and that is worse than the sciatica. By\\r\\ncare and treatment most cases can be greatly helped and cured. Rhus tox\\r\\n(poison ivy) is very good in minute doses in cases where it is impossible\\r\\nto remain in one position for any length of time. Ten drops of the\\r\\ntincture in a glass two-thirds full of water and two teaspoonfuls given\\r\\nevery hour. I have helped many cases with this remedy. The hot iron along\\r\\nthe track of the nerve is helpful. Electricity is better in a chronic case\\r\\nwhere there is wasting of the legs, and it should be combined with\\r\\nmassage. The galvanic current should be used.\\r\\n\\r\\nMOTHERS\\' REMEDIES. Nervousness. 1. Catnip Tea for.--\"A tea made of catnip\\r\\nwill quiet the nerves. This is good for women when they are apt to be\\r\\nnervous.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Nervousness, Hops Will Stop.--\"Purchase a small package of hops at any\\r\\ndrug store, and make a tea of it, drinking frequently in tablespoonful\\r\\ndoses.\" It is a harmless remedy, and should be used more freely by nervous\\r\\npeople. The hops are very soothing. Nervous mothers should never be\\r\\nwithout this. It is surprising to see how few people know the value of\\r\\nsome of these simple home remedies.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Nervousness, Effective Remedy for.--\\r\\n\\r\\n    \"Spirits of Camphor         1/2 ounce\\r\\n    Comp.

Has been used\\r\\nwith marked success in epilepsy and in other various nervous diseases.\"\\r\\nThis is used very extensively for nervous people, and has proven very\\r\\nsuccessful.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHEADACHE.--This term means a pain in the head, all over the head, or at\\r\\none particular spot. It may be only a symptom of a general constitutional\\r\\nderangement, some disease of some other organ, a temporary inability of\\r\\nsome organ like the stomach, liver, bowels, etc., to do work, or it may be\\r\\ndue to some local affection depending upon some trouble with the skull and\\r\\nits contents. It is frequently but a symptom of some other trouble. It\\r\\noccurs in fevers, infectious diseases, brain disease, etc. There are\\r\\ndifferent varieties depending upon the causes.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Sick Headache.\\r\\n  Nervous Headache.\\r\\n  Catarrhal Headache.\\r\\n  Congestive Headache.\\r\\n  Neuralgic or Gastric (stomach) Headache.\\r\\n  Bilious Headache.\\r\\n  \"Bowel\" Headache.\\r\\n  \"Womb\" Headache.\\r\\n  Rheumatic Headache.\\r\\n\\r\\n[NERVOUS SYSTEM 269]\\r\\n\\r\\nCATARRHAL HEADACHE and RHEUMATIC HEADACHE may be treated together. This is\\r\\ndue to exposure to a draught of air, walking against the sharp and keen\\r\\nwind, by getting the feet or other parts of the body wet, sudden\\r\\nsuppression of perspiration about the head, or by some other exposure such\\r\\nas might result from cold, influenza or attack of rheumatism. There may be\\r\\naching pains and a feeling of heavy weight in the forehead; tearing,\\r\\nstitching pains above the eyes, in the cheek bones; sometimes the skull\\r\\nfeels as if it would fall to pieces. In the rheumatic variety the scalp is\\r\\nsore and tender, tearing throbbing pains or hard aching pains. There is\\r\\nsome fever, dry skin, the pulse is faster.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--Get into a sweat by hot drinks of lemonade and hot foot baths.\\r\\nApply cold or warmth to the head, lie down and keep quiet.\\r\\n\\r\\nMedicine.--Aconite in doses of one-tenth of a drop to an adult every hour\\r\\nwill frequently abort it: open the bowels with salts. Remain in bed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNERVOUS HEADACHE.--This may occur as a sick headache or be simply a\\r\\nnervous headache: This occurs oftenest in a nervous person, or in persons\\r\\nwho are run down by different causes, such as diseases, overwork, worry,\\r\\ntrouble, etc. It is not periodic, and has no fixed type, but breaks out at\\r\\nindefinite intervals, and is excited by almost any special cause such as\\r\\nmotions, mental exertions, menses, excitement, overdoing, over-visiting,\\r\\nwant of sleep. It is often due to eye strain in persons who have poorly\\r\\nfitted, or who do not wear glasses. It appears in any part of the head,\\r\\nusually one-sided, or it may be all over the head, which feels enlarged\\r\\nand sometimes as if a band was around it. The least mental effort makes it\\r\\nworse. Sometimes there is a feeling as if a nail was being driven into the\\r\\nhead; head is too big; eyes feel heavy and the lids droop; sees double;\\r\\nhard to keep eyes open. This kind of headache, or sick-headache, can be\\r\\nbrought on suddenly by womb trouble, especially if the womb has fallen\\r\\nfrom a jar, fall, etc. The patient often moans and cries, laments and\\r\\nsimply cannot stand thc pain. In some cases the menses cause it, and it\\r\\nappears at every menstrual period.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--The patient should be quiet and remain in bed in a darkish\\r\\nroom. Womb troubles and other diseases that cause it such as protruding\\r\\npiles, etc., should be attended to. Tincture gelsemium is a good remedy.\\r\\nPut ten drops in a glass half full of water, and take two teaspoonfuls\\r\\nevery half hour until better. A tea made from lady\\'s slipper is also\\r\\neffective in some cases, used freely. Bromide of potash in ten-grain doses\\r\\none-half hour apart, for three doses, if necessary, is quieting in many\\r\\nattacks. Mustard plaster to back of the neck.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCONGESTIVE HEADACHE.--In this kind there is or seems to be too much blood\\r\\nin the head. The patient may be stupid, with a flushed face. If conscious,\\r\\nthe brain feels as if it was rising or falling, especially upon the motion\\r\\nof the head. The top of the head sometimes feels as if it would fly off.\\r\\nThe head throbs and beats violently. The hands and feet may be cold, the\\r\\nface flushed or pale, the eyes bright, the pulse is generally heavy, full\\r\\nand fast, or it may be feeble, slow and intermittent.\\r\\n\\r\\n[270 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--1. The patient should remain in bed in a dark room, with the\\r\\nhead usually high. Cold should be applied to the head and heat to the\\r\\nhands and feet. Move the bowels with salts and, if necessary, give an\\r\\nenema also. It is well to give the foot-bath before going to bed. If\\r\\nthese things do not relieve the headache a doctor should be called, for it\\r\\nmay mean something serious. A hot mustard foot-bath and a mustard plaster\\r\\napplied to the nape of the neck are of great value. In severe cases an ice\\r\\nbag or very cold water, applied to the forehead and temples will very\\r\\noften give great relief.\\r\\n\\r\\n2.  Spirits of Camphor      1 ounce\\r\\n    Spirits of Lavender     2 ounces\\r\\n    Alcohol                 2 ounces\\r\\n\\r\\nWet the top of the head with it.\\r\\n\\r\\n3.  Camphor                  1 dram\\r\\n    Oil of Peppermint        1 dram\\r\\n    Chloroform           1-1/2 ounces\\r\\n    Alcohol enough for       3 ounces\\r\\n\\r\\nShake the bottle and apply a little of the liquid to the place. Horseback\\r\\nriding and walking are good for nervous girls and women.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNEURALGIC HEADACHE.--This commonly comes periodically, usually, one-\\r\\nsided. It may occur at the same hour for several days in succession. The\\r\\npains are of all kinds. It may start in the morning or at any time. It\\r\\ninvolves more especially the eyes, side of the head, face, and goes into\\r\\nthe teeth and neck. It comes in persons subject to neuritis in other parts\\r\\nor neuralgia.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--Build up the system with tonics in the interval. Lead a quiet\\r\\nrestful life. Acetanilid in five-grain doses frequently relieves it. This\\r\\nis a dangerous medicine to use, except under a doctor\\'s supervision.\\r\\nSpigelia in doses of one-twelfth of a drop of the tincture is good for\\r\\nleft-sided attacks; two doses are enough, one-half hour apart.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSTOMACH OR GASTRIC HEADACHE.--This, as the name indicates, is due to some\\r\\nacute or chronic trouble with the stomach. It is caused by over-loading\\r\\nthe stomach, or eating food that does not agree, such as fat meat,\\r\\ngravies, starchy food, warm bread, pastry, etc., or it may be due to\\r\\ndyspepsia. The tongue is generally coated, the mouth tastes bitter. If it\\r\\nis acute and the stomach is full, take a common emetic like warm water,\\r\\nsalt water or mustard water. If it is due to decomposed food, drink lots\\r\\nof warm water and take an enema and also a dose of salts. If there is much\\r\\ngas in the stomach, take some baking soda in a glass of warm water; one\\r\\ndrop doses of tincture of nux vomica every half hour for three hours often\\r\\nrelieves.\\r\\n\\r\\n[NERVOUS SYSTEM 271]\\r\\n\\r\\nHEADACHE FROM CONSTIPATION.--This is frequent. There is generally a dull,\\r\\nheavy feeling in the forehead, the head feels full and sometimes dizzy,\\r\\nthe patient feels blue and morose, the tongue is coated on its back part,\\r\\nmouth tastes bitter, patient is drowsy and stupid and work goes hard. A\\r\\nfree passage from the bowels relieves the headache.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--Cure the constipation as directed in another part of the book.\\r\\nTake a good full enema of warm soap suds and water, and one drop of\\r\\ntincture of nux vomica every hour for six hours during the attack.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBILIOUS HEADACHE.--This is so-called because the bilious symptoms are the\\r\\nmost prominent. It may be caused by violent anger, disputes, excessive\\r\\neating causing congestion of the liver; abuse of spirits; some persons are\\r\\nof a bilious constitution and the least error in diet and habit produces\\r\\nsuch an attack. The pain may be violent or dull, the head may throb\\r\\nterribly; the whites of the eyes have a yellowish look, and the face may\\r\\nbe of a dark brown hue, the patient may vomit bile. The vomiting causes\\r\\nmore brain distress. The mouth is bitter, the tongue coated yellowish, the\\r\\nbreath smells badly. Bowels may be irregular.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--A free movement of the bowels often relieves. First take an\\r\\nenema and then one-half ounce of epsom salts. Do not eat anything but\\r\\ndrink all the water you may wish. A tea made of blue flag is often of\\r\\nbenefit. The diet should be regulated so as not to overload the stomach\\r\\nand liver and the bowels should move freely daily.\\r\\n\\r\\nWOMB HEADACHE.--Women who suffer from womb troubles such as leucorrhea,\\r\\ntorn cervix, falling womb displacements and diseases of the inner womb,\\r\\novaries and tubes, suffer from all kinds of headache. The pain may be in\\r\\nthe nape of the neck, the back part of the head and on the top behind\\r\\n(occiput). It may come on suddenly when the womb is displaced by a sudden\\r\\nfall or over-lifting, etc. The woman should then go to bed and lie down\\r\\nwith her arms crossed over her chest, with the knees drawn up and weight\\r\\nresting upon them and chest with the buttocks elevated, (knee-chest-\\r\\nposition). This replaces the womb. The other troubles should be corrected\\r\\nor these headaches will keep on. The womb and its appendages are the cause\\r\\nof many kinds of headaches, neuralgias, dyspepsia, and constipation;\\r\\ncorrect the troubles and the headache will disappear.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMENSTRUAL HEADACHES.--These are very common. They may be regular every\\r\\nmonth, and they are then caused by some trouble with the womb or ovaries,\\r\\nor may be due to a run-down condition or heredity. It comes sometimes from\\r\\nsuppression of the menses as a consequence of some violent emotion,\\r\\nfright, anger, grief, or by exposure to wet, draughts of air, privations,\\r\\nover-fatigue, etc. It may last for several days. The headache may be mild\\r\\nor severe.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--A foot bath or sitz bath is very good, with free drinking of\\r\\npennyroyal tea after the bath, and when in bed. Place warmth to the feet,\\r\\nmoist heat over the abdomen, such as a hot water bag or fomentations.\\r\\nRemain quietly in bed. If constipated, take an enema. Frequently a free\\r\\nbowel movement gives much relief in this trouble. During the interval\\r\\ndoctor the patient for the trouble causing the headache for which see\\r\\nanother part of this book, \"Diseases of Women.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n[272 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nMOTHERS\\' REMEDIES, 1. Headache, Paregoric and Soda for.--\"A teaspoonful of\\r\\nparegoric, with one-half teaspoonful of baking soda in a tumbler of water,\\r\\nMay be taken all at once or sipped slowly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Headache, Hops Good for.--\"Make a strong decoction of hop tea, and take\\r\\na wineglassful every half hour until relieved.\" This is an old tried\\r\\nremedy and a good one.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Headache, Mustard Excellent for.--\"Place a mustard plaster on the back\\r\\nof the head, also bathe the feet in mustard water and stay in a darkened\\r\\nroom, and avoid all excitement and noise.\" The one essential thing is to\\r\\nget the nerves quieted; take as little food as possible for twenty-four\\r\\nhours, giving the stomach an opportunity to rest, as most of the headaches\\r\\ncome from a disordered stomach.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Headache, Peppermint Beneficial for,--\"Bathe the head in strong\\r\\npeppermint. Then apply cloths wrung from water as hot as can be endured.\"\\r\\nHot or cold applications are known to be very beneficial. After the cloths\\r\\nare taken off, the soothing effect can be further enhanced by gentle\\r\\nrubbing of the forehead.\\r\\n\\r\\n5. Headache, Cold Application in Case of.--\"Apply cold applications on the\\r\\nforehead and over the eyes.\" These cold applications have been known to\\r\\ngive relief in a very few minutes to many people suffering with severe\\r\\nheadaches. It is well to continue the treatment; even after relief has\\r\\nbeen obtained, for at least a half hour. Gentle rubbing of the head is\\r\\nvery good, also.\\r\\n\\r\\n6. Headache, Castor Oil Will Relieve.--\"One tablespoonful of castor oil.\\r\\nHave used this and found relief.\" This remedy gives relief as the castor\\r\\noil carries off the food that is distressing the stomach. It is well to\\r\\ntake two tablespoonfuls of lime-water in a glass of milk three times a day\\r\\nfor about a week after the castor oil has operated.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSICK HEADACHE. (Migraine. Hemicrania).--Migraine is a peculiar form of\\r\\nsevere paroxysms of unilateral (one side) headache often associated with\\r\\ndisorders of sight.\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses.--It is frequently hereditary, and it has occurred through several\\r\\ngenerations. Women and members of nervous families are usually attacked.\\r\\nMany of the headaches from eye-strain are of this type, It is often\\r\\ninherited, and may last from puberty to the menopause. Some authors claim\\r\\nthat decay of the teeth without toothache will cause it. Adenoid growths\\r\\nin the pharynx and particularly abnormal conditions of the nose will cause\\r\\nit. Many of the attacks of severe headaches in children are of this\\r\\nnature, and the eyes, nose and throat should be examined when children or\\r\\nolder persons suffer from this complaint. Mental emotion, physical or\\r\\nmental fatigue, disorders of the female genital organs, eye-strain, etc.,\\r\\nloud noises, toothache, act as predisposing causes. Some think it a\\r\\npoisonous condition due to the absorption of poisons from the stomach and\\r\\nintestines, and others regard it as a nervous condition due to anemia and\\r\\nall conditions which weaken the resistance of the nervous system.\\r\\n\\r\\n[NERVOUS SYSTEM 273]\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--The premonitory symptoms, which may last a few hours or a day\\r\\nor more, are sleepy feelings of discomfort, uneasiness, weariness, chills,\\r\\nvertigo (dizziness), disturbance of the sight or disturbances of the\\r\\nsenses. The real attack may follow quickly, beginning with the\\r\\ncharacteristic headache, at first one sided, located in one spot in the\\r\\ntemple, eye or back of the head, but spreading, as it increases in\\r\\nseverity, until it involves all of one side of the head and occasionally\\r\\nboth sides. The pain is usually constant and of great severity and it is\\r\\nincreased by motion, noises, light, or mental strain. The skin over the\\r\\npainful part is very sensitive. There are loss of appetite, nausea and\\r\\nvomiting. If the stomach has a great deal of food in it, vomiting relieves\\r\\nthe pain sometimes. In the spasmodic form the affected side is painful,\\r\\nthe skin is cool, the pupil is dilated, and the flow of saliva is\\r\\nincreased. In the paralytic form the affected side is flushed, hot, the\\r\\nvessels are dilated and the pupils are contracted. There is great\\r\\nweakness, prostration and depression. The urine may be abundant or\\r\\nsuppressed, temporarily. The results of treatment in this disease are\\r\\nuncertain, as the attacks are likely to occur in spite of treatment. They\\r\\nusually cease in old age, and in women they may stop after the menopause.\\r\\nThe attacks in women are likely to occur at or near the menstrual periods.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst Thing to do in Sick Headache.--It is well to remain in a darkened\\r\\nroom away from noise, etc. If the head throbs and beats very hard, either\\r\\na cold ice bag or hot applications often bring relief. A mustard plaster\\r\\nat the base of the brain with a hot foot-bath often helps. Some people by\\r\\nstroking the forehead and temples have the power to ease the pain,\\r\\nproducing quiet and sleep. If the bowels are costive, salts should be\\r\\ntaken to move them, or they can be moved by an enema, if salts are not at\\r\\nhand. If the stomach is full, or tastes sour, drink a lot of warm water\\r\\nand vomit, or produce vomiting by tickling your throat with your finger,\\r\\nafter having taken a large quantity of warm water for sometimes warm water\\r\\nthus taken fails to cause vomiting. If there is no food in the stomach,\\r\\nbut there is sour and bilious vomiting, the warm water will frequently\\r\\nhelp. For a sour stomach or when it is full of gas, a teaspoonful of\\r\\nbaking soda in some hot water will often feel very pleasant and grateful.\\r\\nThe patient should keep absolutely quiet after these are done, and often\\r\\nthey fall into a refreshing sleep.\\r\\n\\r\\n[274 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nEMERGENCY MEDICINES.--If anemia is the cause, give tonics such as iron and\\r\\narsenic. If the patient feels faint and nauseated, a small cup of strong\\r\\nhot coffee gives relief, sometimes. Antipyrin, given early in doses of two\\r\\nand one-half grains often relieves. Take another dose in one-half hour if\\r\\nnecessary. But such remedies are hard on the heart.\\r\\n\\r\\nTREATMENT. Preventive in Sick Headache.--The patient is often aware of the\\r\\ncauses that bring on an attack. Such causes should be avoided. A great\\r\\nmany people who are afflicted with this trouble are not only careless in\\r\\ntheir eating, eating anything and everything and at all times--at meal\\r\\ntime and between meals--but also careless in their habits of life.\\r\\nPatients should avoid excitement, like card parties, etc., staying up\\r\\nlate, or reading exciting books. The meals should be regular, no food\\r\\ntaken that is hard to digest. Pies, cakes, puddings, gravies, ham, pork,\\r\\nsausage, and fried foods must be avoided. Rich, greasy foods will not do\\r\\nfor such persons to eat. Strong tea and coffee are bad. Plenty of water\\r\\nshould be taken between meals. At meals it is better to take no water\\r\\nunless it is hot water. Every morning on arising it is well to drink a\\r\\nlarge quantity of either cold or hot water. This washes out the stomach,\\r\\nbowels and kidneys, and stimulates them to better perform their functions.\\r\\nThe bowels must be kept regular, one or more passages a day and at a\\r\\nregular hour. Sometimes, especially in younger persons, the eyes are at\\r\\nfault and may need glasses. Frequently it is caused by overwork in school\\r\\nin young girls, especially during their menstrual periods. Social duties\\r\\ncause them in many women, and then strong tea or coffee, or headache\\r\\npowders, or tablets, are taken to keep up or to stop the pain, making the\\r\\npatient more liable to the attacks in the future; and then still more tea,\\r\\ncoffee, and headache remedies are taken until the patient is a slave to\\r\\nthe remedies taken to help her. A great many of these headaches can be\\r\\nhelped by simple measures, and the time between the attacks, in about all\\r\\ncases, made longer if the patient will but work with the physician, not\\r\\nonly at the time of the attack, but in the interval. The clothing should\\r\\nbe comfortable. The feet should always be kept dry. This applies\\r\\nespecially to neuralgia. In fact the above measures of prevention and care\\r\\napply to all kinds of headaches and neuralgias. Prevention is worth more\\r\\nthan the cure.\\r\\n\\r\\nMOTHERS\\' REMEDIES. 1. Sick Headache, Hop Tea Will Relieve.--\"Hop tea is\\r\\nvery good if a good strong decoction is made. A wineglassful may be taken\\r\\nevery half hour or hour until relieved.\" This is very easily prepared, as\\r\\nthe hops may be purchased at any drug store.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Sick Headache, a Favorite Remedy for.--\"Aconite liniment or aconite\\r\\nrubbed on the forehead will relieve the pain in the head almost instantly.\\r\\nOne drop of the tincture of nux vomica in a teaspoonful of water every\\r\\nfive or ten minutes will quickly relieve.\" Nux vomica is good only when\\r\\nthe headache comes from constipation and stomach trouble and too high\\r\\nliving.\\r\\n\\r\\n[NERVOUS SYSTEM 275]\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Sick Headache, Aromatic Spirits of Ammonia for.--\"For a nervous\\r\\nheadache there is nothing better for immediate relief than fifteen or\\r\\ntwenty drops of the aromatic spirits of ammonia.\" This relieves the pain\\r\\nand quiets the nerves and stimulates the heart.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Sick Headache, Camphor Application for.--\"A very simple but effective\\r\\nremedy is a cloth wet with spirits of camphor and sprinkled with black\\r\\npepper applied to the head gives almost instant relief.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n5. Headache, Soda and Peppermint for.--\"One teaspoonful (level) of soda in\\r\\ntwo-thirds glass of hot water, add five or eight drops of oil of\\r\\npeppermint and a little sugar. Drink quite warm. This has been often tried\\r\\nand proven to be a success.\" The soda will relieve any gas in the stomach\\r\\nand the peppermint aids digestion and relieves sickness of the stomach.\\r\\n\\r\\n6. Sick Headache, Lemon Good for.--\"One lemon before breakfast will help\\r\\nto keep off sick headache. Have never found a remedy to cure sick\\r\\nheadaches. A sack of hot salt will always help the pain.\" The lemon will\\r\\nhelp to tone up the stomach and the salt applied to the head will help the\\r\\npain by relieving the congestion. It is always well to take a good\\r\\ncathartic after a spell of sick headache.\\r\\n\\r\\nPHYSICIANS\\' TREATMENT for Sick Headache.--\\r\\n\\r\\n1.  Antipyrine               25 grains\\r\\n    Citrate of Caffeine      10 grains\\r\\n    Bromide of Potash        25 grains\\r\\n\\r\\nMix and make into five powders. One powder as needed. (You might take\\r\\nsecond one in three hours.) This is not good when it is bilious sick\\r\\nheadache. In fact, it would make it worse. It is good for sick headache\\r\\nand neuralgia due to eye or nerve strain, but then the first remedy,\\r\\nantipyrine, can be left out. It is not needed. I would then put twice as\\r\\nmuch of the bromide of potash, fifty grains, and take a powder every two\\r\\nhours until better.\\r\\n\\r\\n2.  Citrate of Caffeine    1/2 dram (30 grains)\\r\\n    Phenacetine             60 grains\\r\\n    Bicarbonate of soda     60 grains\\r\\n    Aromatic powder         12 grains\\r\\n\\r\\nMix and make twelve powders. Take one every three hours. This is good.\\r\\nSometimes it is depressing on the heart for some people, due to the\\r\\nphenacetine. Acetanilid can be substituted in same dose.\\r\\n\\r\\n(The homeopathic treatment is very successful in relieving spells of sick\\r\\nheadache. See chapter on Homeopathy.)\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Sodium Phosphate, taken every morning, about one-half to one\\r\\nteaspoonful in hot water. It is good for the bowels and liver.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Prescription for the Liver and Bowels in Sick Headache.--\\r\\n\\r\\n    Sulphate of soda       30 grains\\r\\n    Salicylate of soda     10 grains\\r\\n    Sulphate of Magnesia    1 grain\\r\\n    Benzoate of Lithia      5 grains\\r\\n    Tincture of Nux Vomica  3 minims\\r\\n    Distilled water         4 ounces\\r\\n\\r\\nThis mixture should be made up in large quantity and placed in a siphon by\\r\\none of the concerns which charge soda water, and from one-quarter to\\r\\none-half a glass of this water, at ordinary temperature, is to be taken\\r\\nevery morning at least one-half an hour before breakfast; enough being\\r\\ntaken to insure an adequate bowel movement during the forenoon. This ought\\r\\nto be a good combination to use regularly.\\r\\n\\r\\n[276 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\n5. Dr. Hare gives the following recommendations. Probably no single source\\r\\nof pain compares in its frequency to headache, chiefly because it is\\r\\nessentially a symptom of diseases or functional disturbances.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt may come from constipation or eye strain, from brain disease, anemia,\\r\\nuremia, too much blood in the head, etc. In many cases a mild laxative to\\r\\nthoroughly empty the bowels is necessary. Sometimes the urine will be\\r\\ndeficient in solids and liquids, so that the effete and poisonous material\\r\\nare retained in the blood, which produce headache. For such cases if the\\r\\nurine is acid, the frequent use of Vichy water, to which is added a little\\r\\nbicarbonate of potassium, about five grains to a drink, as a diuretic will\\r\\nprove of great service. If the urine is alkaline (and this you can tell by\\r\\nusing a red litmus paper which will turn blue if it is alkaline) ten grain\\r\\ndoses of benzoate of ammonium three (3) times a day are often useful.\\r\\n\\r\\nNERVE TUMORS (Neuroma).--A morbid increase in the tissue-elements of the\\r\\nperipheral (the external surface) nerves.\\r\\n\\r\\nVarieties. True and False Nerve Tumors.--True nerve tumors (neuromata) are\\r\\ncomposed of nerve-fibres provided with a medullary (marrow) sheath or of\\r\\nnerve tissue; false nerve tumors are composed of other structure than\\r\\nnerve tissue, are usually of secondary origin, extending to the nerve from\\r\\nnearby structures.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--The true nerve tumors may be hereditary or due to wounds or\\r\\nblows and amputation. They may give rise to no symptoms, or may cause\\r\\nintermittent pain. Pressure increases this pain, when the condition of the\\r\\nnerve fibre is interfered with. Loss of local sensation and power may\\r\\ndevelop. It is sometimes possible to feel the little nodular growths, and\\r\\nthey can be seen when they are superficial. They may give no pain, or they\\r\\nmay become very sensitive. They may become chronic and they are very\\r\\nliable to do so. Some of them may disappear.\\r\\n\\r\\nPHYSICIANS\\' TREATMENT for Nerve Tumor.--The severe forms should be cut\\r\\nout; others can be let alone.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNEURITIS (Inflammation of the Nerves. Neura-Nerves; Itis-Inflammation.\\r\\nInflammation of the Bundles of Nerve Fibres).--Nagel describes it as \"an\\r\\ninflammation of the nerves of an acute or chronic nature, associated with\\r\\nmore or less degeneration, change in the nerve fibrils of the affected\\r\\nnerves.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n[NERVOUS SYSTEM 277]\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses.--An injury to the nerves, frequent muscular strains, exposure to\\r\\ncold. Inflammation can extend to the nerve from adjacent inflamed\\r\\nstructures. Pressure can cause it. Fractures of bones cause it by\\r\\ncompression and it is also caused by infectious diseases, such as\\r\\nrheumatism, typhoid fever, syphilis, etc. In some cases it simply appears\\r\\nwithout apparent cause.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the disease process involves the nerve sheaths and connective tissue\\r\\nstructures in particular, an interstitial neuritis results; when the\\r\\ndisease locates itself in the nerve fibrils it gives rise to\\r\\n\"parenchymatous neuritis\" (main part of the nerve is inflamed).\\r\\n\\r\\nSimple Neuritis.--This means that a single nerve of a group of adjacent\\r\\nnerve trunks is affected. If a number of nerves are affected at the same\\r\\ntime it is called Multiple Neuritis or Polyneuritis.\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses.--(a) Exposure to cold. This is a very frequent cause, as for\\r\\nexample, in the facial (face) nerve. (b) Traumatism,--that is, wounds,\\r\\nblows, injuries caused by fractures and dislocations; pressure from\\r\\ntumors, sleeping with the head resting on the arms. Pressure from\\r\\ncrutches, \"crutch paralysis.\" (c) Diseases involving the nerves due to\\r\\nextension of inflammation from nearby structures, as in neuritis of the\\r\\nfacial nerve due to decay of the temporal bone.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--The constitutional or general symptoms are usually slight. The\\r\\npain is the most important symptom, being of a boring in the parts to\\r\\nwhich it is distributed. This pain may be very distressing, or of a\\r\\nstabbing character, and is usually felt in the course of the nerve; or it\\r\\nmay cause little inconvenience. Sometimes the skin is red and swollen over\\r\\nthe affected parts. There is impaired nerve function and as a result of\\r\\nthis the muscles supplied by these nerves become weak, and occasionally\\r\\nparalyzed. In severe cases they may become atrophied and an eruption often\\r\\nappears along the course of the nerve. Sometimes the hair and nails are\\r\\nnot properly nourished, causing falling out or grayness of the hair and\\r\\nloss of the nails. This neuritis may extend from the peripheral (external)\\r\\nnerves and involve the larger nerve trunks or even reach the spinal cord.\\r\\nThis rarely occurs in neuritis from cold, or in that which follows fevers;\\r\\nbut it occurs most frequently in neuritis caused by blows, wounds, etc.,\\r\\n(traumatic).\\r\\n\\r\\nDuration.--This varies from a few days to weeks or months. If the primary\\r\\ncause can be remedied it usually ends in full recovery. Sometimes it is\\r\\nfollowed by the chronic form.\\r\\n\\r\\nPHYSICIANS\\' TREATMENT for Neuritis.--The first thing to do is to try to\\r\\nremove the cause. Then absolute and continued rest of the affected part.\\r\\nIf one has a sore hand it will be rested, if possible; so it must be with\\r\\nthe sore and inflamed nerve.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the Attack.--After having placed the part in absolute rest, moist heat\\r\\napplied to it frequently brings great relief. Sometimes a mustard plaster\\r\\napplied along the sore part does good. This produces a counter irritation\\r\\nand thus draws some of the congestion from the congested, inflamed nerve.\\r\\nIce is more effective in some cases than heat. The bowels should be kept\\r\\nopen daily with salts. Build up the general health with tonics; no alcohol\\r\\ncan be used. If it shows a tendency to become chronic, use massage,\\r\\nelectricity or change of climate. Atrophy (shrinking) of the muscles is\\r\\nlikely to follow if the disease continues long and for this massage and\\r\\nelectricity must be given.\\r\\n\\r\\n[278 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment. Preventive.--A person who has once had neuritis must exercise\\r\\nall care to keep from taking cold or exposing themselves to severe cold\\r\\nwinds and storms. Wet clothing will be apt to cause its return. Damp\\r\\nhouses are bad. The climate should be dry and not changeable. There should\\r\\nbe enough and proper kind of clothing to keep the body heat at the normal\\r\\npoint. Plenty of rest and sleep are required. These cautions also apply to\\r\\nrheumatism and neuralgias.\\r\\n\\r\\nMultiple Neuritis.--Other names: Polyneuritis, Disseminated Neuritis,\\r\\nPeripheral Neuritis. Meaning--Multiple neuritis is an inflammatory disease\\r\\nof the peripheral (toward the end of the nerves or external nerves)\\r\\nnervous system. It varies much in extent and intensity and affects\\r\\nsymmetrical parts of the body.\\r\\n\\r\\nVarieties.--These arise from differences in the nature, causes, severity\\r\\nand location of the disease process.\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses.--They are many. (1.) The poison that comes from infectious\\r\\ndiseases such as typhoid fever, diphtheria, smallpox, leprosy, la grippe,\\r\\netc. (2) From poisons such as alcohol, lead, arsenic; phosphorus, mercury,\\r\\ncoal gas, etc. (3) From anemia, cancer, tuberculosis, syphilis,\\r\\nsepticemia, diabetes. (4) From cold, over-exertion, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--Acute febrile multiple neuritis. A typical case: This comes on\\r\\nfrom exposure to cold, over-exertion, or in some cases spontaneously.\\r\\nThere are chills, headaches, pains in the back, limbs and joints, and the\\r\\ncase may be called rheumatism. Loss of appetite, coated tongue,\\r\\nconstipation, and other symptoms of stomach and bowel trouble. The\\r\\ntemperature rises rapidly, and may go to 103 to 104 degrees. The limbs and\\r\\nback ache, but intense pain in the nerves are not always constant. The\\r\\npain is usually sharp, severe, and located in the limbs, and is worse from\\r\\nmoving and pressure. There are tingling feelings in the hands, feet and\\r\\nbody, and a feeling as if ants or insects were crawling over them, and\\r\\nthere is also increased sensitiveness of the nerve trunks or entire limb.\\r\\nThere is loss of muscular power, first marked, perhaps, in the legs, and\\r\\nit extends upwards and reaches the arms. Sometimes it first begins in the\\r\\narms. In typical cases the extending muscles of the wrist and ankles drop.\\r\\n(Wristdrop and foot-drop). In severe cases there is a general loss of\\r\\nmuscular power, producing a flabby paralysis. This may extend to the\\r\\nmuscles that control speaking, swallowing and hearing resulting in\\r\\nimpairment of these functions. The muscles soften and waste away rapidly.\\r\\nDisorders of nutrition are frequent, like watery swelling (oedema), glossy\\r\\nlooking skin, sweating, hives, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\n[NERVOUS SYSTEM 279]\\r\\n\\r\\nRecovery.--The course of the disease varies considerably. In mild cases\\r\\nthe symptoms disappear very soon. In the worst form the patient may die in\\r\\na week or ten days. As a rule, in moderately severe cases after persisting\\r\\nfor five or six weeks, the condition remains about the same for a few\\r\\nmonths, and then improvement slowly begins and recovery takes place in six\\r\\nto twelve months. In neuritis from alcohol drinking there is a rapid onset\\r\\nas a rule, with delirium and delusions. The result is usually favorable\\r\\nand after persisting for weeks or months improvement gradually begins, the\\r\\nmuscles regain their power, and even in the most desperate cases recovery\\r\\nmay follow. The mental symptoms are very severe in alcoholic cases.\\r\\nDelirium is common. It takes much longer for such cases to regain what\\r\\nthey call their normal condition.\\r\\n\\r\\nNeuritis following diphtheria and other infectious diseases. The outlook\\r\\nin cases from these diseases is usually favorable, and except in\\r\\ndiphtheria, fatal cases are uncommon. It is most common from diphtheria.\\r\\nRecovery, in neuritis from diphtheria, takes place in about three months,\\r\\nbut some cases are fatal.\\r\\n\\r\\nNeuritis from lead.--The first symptoms are those of intestinal colic,\\r\\nlead line on the gums, \"dropped-wrist.\" The recovery is quite gradual and\\r\\nthe poison may be cast out in three to four months.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Neuritis from Arsenic.--We have disturbance of the stomach and bowels\\r\\nfirst, then the legs and arms are about equally affected, weakened; may\\r\\nrecover in two to six months.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment for acute kind.--The first thing to do is to rest in bed and\\r\\ncontrol the pain and acute symptoms. Hot applications help to relieve the\\r\\nsuffering. Patient must be kept comfortably and constantly warm and quiet.\\r\\nHot applications of lead water and laudanum.\\r\\n\\r\\nMedicines.--It may be necessary to use morphine to control the pain.\\r\\nRemedies such as antipyrine or aspirin are often used. A physician must be\\r\\ncalled. When the disease is caused by arsenic and lead and alcohol, of\\r\\ncourse you must remove the cause before you can hope for any improvement.\\r\\n\\r\\nCaution.--Any one can readily understand from reading this description\\r\\nthat the thing to do is to be careful not to needlessly expose yourself to\\r\\ntaking cold. One subject to rheumatism or neuritis, even in small degree,\\r\\nshould take care not only not to take cold but not to overdo in laboring;\\r\\ncold, wet and over-exertion cause the majority of the acute attacks. But\\r\\nsome are caused by diseases, such as diphtheria, typhoid fever, etc., and\\r\\na great many cases of neuritis following these and other infectious\\r\\ndiseases can be avoided if proper care is taken during and after these\\r\\ndiseases. Such care can easily be taken. Keep your rooms warm and\\r\\ncomfortable, and the patient in bed or in a comfortable room until all\\r\\ndanger is past. How often I have heard a doctor blamed for such results\\r\\nwhen in most cases it is the patient\\'s or nurse\\'s fault. Certain results\\r\\nwill follow certain diseases and only proper care can keep such results\\r\\nfrom following. Dropsy frequently follows even a light case of scarlet\\r\\nfever. Why? Simply because, on account of being a light case, the child is\\r\\nleft to roam at will about the rooms and catches cold, takes la grippe. If\\r\\npeople would only take care of themselves this disease would not leave so\\r\\nmany lifelong victims. I have seen men and women who have just recovered\\r\\nfrom this disease stand on the street corners on a cold, damp day, and\\r\\ntalk an hour, and the next day they wondered how they could possibly have\\r\\ntaken cold. We cannot disobey the laws of nature safely. Persons who are\\r\\nsubject to neuritis or rheumatism should be especially careful on cold,\\r\\ndamp, wet days and of over-exertion.\\r\\n\\r\\n[280 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGENERAL AND FUNCTIONAL BRAIN DISEASES. NERVOUS\\r\\nPROSTRATION. NERVOUS EXHAUSTION.\\r\\nNEURASTHENIA.\\r\\n\\r\\nNERVOUS PROSTRATION.--Is a condition of weakness or exhaustion of the\\r\\nnervous system, giving rise to various forms of mental and bodily\\r\\ninefficiency.\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses. 1. Hereditary causes.--Some children are born of parents who are\\r\\nweak themselves, and who have led fast lives through business or pleasure\\r\\nand these parents have given their offspring a weakened body, and the\\r\\nchildren are handicapped with a nervous predisposition and furnish a\\r\\nconsiderable proportion of \"nervous\" patients.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Acquired.--It is acquired by continual worry and overwork, sexual\\r\\nindiscretion, excesses, irregular living and indiscretion in diet. A great\\r\\nmany business men, teachers and journalists become \"neurasthenics.\" It may\\r\\nfollow infectious diseases, particularly influenza, typhoid fever and\\r\\nsyphilis. It also follows operations sometimes. Alcohol, tobacco, morphine\\r\\nmay produce a high grade of the disease, if their use is abused.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--These are varied. The most prominent symptom is fatigue. The\\r\\npatient feels so tired and complains of being unable to do any mental\\r\\nlabor. It is almost impossible to put the mind on one subject for any\\r\\nlength of time. There are headache, dizziness, want of sleep, and there is\\r\\ngreat depression of spirits; patient is gloomy, irritable in temper with\\r\\nmanifestations of hysteria. Sometimes there are marked symptoms of spinal\\r\\ntrouble. Pain along the spine with spots or areas of tenderness. Pains\\r\\nsimulating rheumatism are present. There is frequently great muscular\\r\\nweakness, great prostration after the least exertion, and a feeling of\\r\\nnumbness, tingling, and neuralgic pains. In spinal symptoms, there is an\\r\\naching pain in the back, or in the back of the neck, which is a quite\\r\\nconstant complaint. Then there  are the anxiety symptoms in many cases.\\r\\nThere may be only a fear of impending insanity or of approaching death, or\\r\\nof apoplexy, in simple cases. More frequently the anxious feeling is\\r\\nlocalized somewhere in the body, in the heart region, in the head, in the\\r\\nabdomen, in the thorax (chest, etc.). In some cases the anxiety becomes\\r\\nintense. They are so restless they do not know what to do with themselves.\\r\\nThey throw themselves on the bed, complain, and cry, etc. Sometimes the\\r\\npatients become so desperate they commit suicide. Some patients do not\\r\\nwish to see anyone. Some patients cannot read, reading wearies them so\\r\\nmuch, or they get confused and dizzy and must stop. Some are very\\r\\nirritable. They complain of everything. Remember they cannot help it,\\r\\nusually. Some are easily insulted and claim they are misunderstood. The\\r\\ncirculation may be disturbed in some cases. Then there is palpitation of\\r\\nthe heart, irregular and very rapid pulse, pains, and feeling of\\r\\noppression around the heart, cold hands, and feet. The heart\\'s action may\\r\\nbe increased by the least excitement and with the fast pulse and\\r\\npalpitation there are feelings of dizziness and anxiety and such patients\\r\\nare sure they have organic disease of the heart. No wonder. Flashes of\\r\\nheat, especially in the head, and transient congestion of the skin are\\r\\ndistressing symptoms. Profuse sweating may occur. In women, especially,\\r\\nand sometimes in men, the hands and feet are cold, the nose is red or\\r\\nblue, and the face feels \"pinched.\" Nervous dyspepsia is present in many\\r\\ncases. The digestion is poor and slow and constipation accompanies it.\\r\\nSometimes there is neuralgia of the stomach. The sexual organs are\\r\\nseemingly affected, many men are \"almost scared to death\" and they use all\\r\\nsorts of quack remedies to restore their sexual vigor. Spermatorrhea is\\r\\ntheir bugbear. They usually get well if they stop worrying. In women there\\r\\nis the tender ovary and the menstruation may be painful or irregular. The\\r\\ncondition of the urine in these patients is important. Many cases are\\r\\ncomplicated with lithaemia (sand-stone in the urine). It is sometimes also\\r\\nincreased in quantity.\\r\\n\\r\\n[NERVOUS SYSTEM 281]\\r\\n\\r\\nPHYSICIANS\\' TREATMENT for Nervous Prostration.--The patient must be\\r\\nassured and made to believe that the disease is curable, but that it will\\r\\ntake time and earnest help on the part of the patient. Much medicine is\\r\\nnot needed, only enough to keep the system working well. Encouragement is\\r\\nwhat is needed from attendants. Remove the patient from the causes that\\r\\nproduce the trouble, whether it be business, worry, over-study, too much\\r\\nsocial duties, or excesses of any kind. The patient must have confidence\\r\\nin the physician, and he must be attentive to the complaints of the\\r\\npatient. It is the height of foolishness and absurdity for a physician to\\r\\ntell such a patient before he has thoroughly examined him or her that the\\r\\ntroubles are imaginary. I believe that is not prudent in the majority of\\r\\ncases. I have heard physicians talk that way to such patients. I thought,\\r\\nwhat fools! The patient needs proper sympathy and sensible encouragement.\\r\\nYou must make them believe they are going to get well. If you do not wish\\r\\nto do this, refuse such cases, or you will fail with them. If there are\\r\\nany patients that need encouragement and kindly, sympathetic, judicious\\r\\n\"cheering up,\" these patients are the ones, and they generally are\\r\\n\"laughed at and made fun of\" by people who should know better. Remember\\r\\ntheir troubles are real to them, and are due to exhaustion or prostration\\r\\nof the nervous system and this condition, as before described, produces\\r\\nhorrid feelings and sensations of almost every part of the body. The\\r\\npatient must be made to believe that he may expect to get well; and he\\r\\nmust be told that much depends upon himself, and that he must make a\\r\\nvigorous effort to overcome certain of his tendencies, and that all his\\r\\npower of will will be needed to further the progress of the cure.\\r\\n\\r\\n[282 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst, then, is rest.--Both mental and physical diversions, nutritious\\r\\nthough easily digested food, and removal of baneful influences as far as\\r\\npossible. Physical exercise for the lazy. Rest for the anemic and weak.\\r\\nFor business or professional men the treatment is to get away and far off,\\r\\nif possible, from business. It will often be found best to make out a\\r\\ndaily programme for those that must remain at home, something to keep the\\r\\nmind busy without tiring, and then times of rest. The patient, if it is\\r\\npossible, should be away from home if home influences and surroundings are\\r\\nnot agreeable. Dr. S. Weir Mitchell, of Philadelphia, has devised and\\r\\nelaborated a cure, called a rest cure, for the relief of this class of\\r\\npatients, and it is wonderfully successful especially in thin people. \"Be\\r\\nthe symptoms what they may, as long as they are dependent upon nerve\\r\\nstrain, this \\'cure\\' is to be resorted to, and if properly carried out is\\r\\noften attended with surprising results.\" \"A bright, airy, easily cleaned,\\r\\nand comfortable room, is to be selected, and adjoining it, if possible,\\r\\nshould be a smaller one for an attendant or nurse. The patient is put to\\r\\nbed and kept there from three to six weeks, or longer as may be necessary,\\r\\nand during this time is allowed to see no one except the nurse and doctor,\\r\\nsince the presence of friends requires conversation and mental effort. The\\r\\npatient in severe cases must be fed by the nurse in order to avoid\\r\\nexpenditure of the force required in the movement of the arms. No sitting\\r\\nup in bed is allowed and if any reading is done it must be done by the\\r\\nnurse who can read aloud for an hour a day (I have seen cases where even\\r\\nthat could not be done). In the case of women, the hair should be dressed\\r\\nby the nurse to avoid any physical effort on the part of the patient. To\\r\\ntake the place of ordinary exercise, two measures are employed, the first\\r\\nof which is massage or rubbing; the second, electricity. By the kneading\\r\\nand rubbing of the muscles and skin the liquids in the tissues are\\r\\nabsorbed and poured into the lymph spaces, and a healthy blush is brought\\r\\nto the skin. This passive exercise is performed in the morning or\\r\\nafternoon, and should last from one-half to an hour, every part of the\\r\\nbody being kneaded, even the face and scalp. In the afternoon or morning\\r\\nthe various muscles should be passively exercised by electricity, each\\r\\nmuscle being made to contact by the application of the poles of the\\r\\nbattery to its motor points, the slowly interrupted current being used.\\r\\nNeither of these forms of exercise call for any expenditure of nerve\\r\\nforce; they keep up the general nutrition. The following programme for a\\r\\nday\\'s existence is an example of what the physician should order:\\r\\n\\r\\n[NERVOUS SYSTEM 283]\\r\\n\\r\\n7:30 a. m.--Glass of hot or cold milk, predigested, boiled or raw as the\\r\\ncase requires.\\r\\n\\r\\n8:00 a. m.--The nurse is to sponge the patient with tepid water or with\\r\\ncold and hot water alternately to stimulate the skin and circulation, the\\r\\nbody being well wrapped in a blanket, except the portion which is being\\r\\nbathed. After this the nurse should dry the part last wetted, with a rough\\r\\ntowel, using some friction to stimulate the skin.\\r\\n\\r\\n8:30 a. m.--Breakfast. Boiled, poached or scrambled eggs, milk toast,\\r\\nwater toast, or a finely cut piece of mutton chop or chicken.\\r\\n\\r\\n10:00 a. m.--Massage.\\r\\n\\r\\n11:00 a. m.--A glass of milk, or a milk punch, or egg-nog.\\r\\n\\r\\n12:00 m.--Reading for an hour.\\r\\n\\r\\n1:00 p. m.--Dinner. Small piece of steak, rare roast beef, consomme soup,\\r\\nmutton broth, and any one of the easily digested vegetables, well cooked.\\r\\n\\r\\n3:00 p. m.--Electricity.\\r\\n\\r\\n4:30 p. m.--A glass of milk, a milk punch or egg-nog.\\r\\n\\r\\n6:30 p. m.--Supper. This should be very plain, no tea or coffee, but toast\\r\\nand butter, milk, curds and whey, or a plain custard.\\r\\n\\r\\n9 :30 p. m.--A glass of milk or milk punch.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this way the day is well filled, and the time does not drag so heavily\\r\\nas would be thought. If the stomach rebels at over feeding, the amount of\\r\\nfood must be cut down, but when all the effort of the body is concentrated\\r\\non respiration, circulation, and digestion a large amount of nourishment\\r\\ncan be assimilated by the exhausted body, which before this treatment is\\r\\nundertaken may have had its resources so shattered as to be unable to\\r\\ncarry out any physiological act perfectly. For the treatment to be\\r\\nsuccessful the rules laid down should be rigidly followed, and the cure\\r\\nshould last from three to six weeks or longer.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHYSTERIA.--A state in which ideas control the body and produce morbid\\r\\nchanges in its functions.\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses.--It occurs mostly in women, and usually appears first about the\\r\\ntime of puberty, but the manifestations may continue until the menopause\\r\\nor even until old age. It occurs in all races. Children under twelve years\\r\\nare not very often affected. A physician writes: One of the saddest\\r\\nchapters in the history of human deception, that of the Salem witches,\\r\\nmight be headed, \"Hysteria in Children,\" since the tragedy resulted\\r\\ndirectly from the hysterical pranks of girls under twelve years of age.\\r\\nDuring late years it has been quite frequent among men and boys. It seems\\r\\nto occur oftener in the warm and mild climates than in the cold. There are\\r\\ntwo predisposing causes that are very important--heredity and education.\\r\\nHeredity acts by endowing the child with a movable (mobile) abnormally\\r\\nsensitive nervous organization. Cases are seen most frequently in families\\r\\nwith marked nervous disease tendencies, whose members have suffered from\\r\\nvarious sorts of nervous diseases.\\r\\n\\r\\n[284 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nEducation.--The proper home education is neglected. Some parents allow\\r\\ntheir girls to grow up accustomed to have every whim gratified, abundant\\r\\nsympathy lavished on every woe, however trifling, and the girl reaches\\r\\nwomanhood with a moral organization unfitted to withstand the cares and\\r\\nworries of every-day life. And between the ages of twelve and sixteen, the\\r\\nmost important in her life, when the vital energies are absorbed in the\\r\\nrapid development of the body, the girl is often \"cramming\" for\\r\\nexaminations and cooped in close schoolrooms for six or eight hours daily;\\r\\nnot only that, but at home she is often practicing and taking lessons on\\r\\nthe piano in connection with the full school work. The result too often is\\r\\nan active bright mind in an enfeebled body, ill-adapted to subserve the\\r\\nfunctions for which it was framed, easily disordered, and prone to act\\r\\nabnormally to the ordinary stimuli of life.\\r\\n\\r\\nDirect Influences.--Those influences that directly bring on the attack are\\r\\nfright, anxiety, grief, love affairs, and domestic worries, especially in\\r\\nthose of a nervous nature. Diseases of the generative organs and organic\\r\\ndiseases in general, and of the nervous system especially, may be causes\\r\\nof hysteria.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--These may be divided into two classes: 1. Interparoxysmal or\\r\\ntime between the paroxysms (spells). 2. Paroxysmal. During the time of the\\r\\nattack. First variety--The will power seems defective. In bad cases\\r\\nself-control is lost. The patient is irritable, and easily annoyed by the\\r\\nslightest trifle; is very excitable and easily moved to laughter or tears\\r\\nwithout any apparent cause for either. Easily discouraged and despondent.\\r\\nShe wants lots of sympathy. Second--Loss of sensation is frequently\\r\\npresent, and it is most commonly one-sided; it may involve certain parts,\\r\\nas one or two limbs, the trunk escaping, or part of one limb. Various\\r\\nspots of want of sensation (feeling) may exist. The skin of the affected\\r\\nside is frequently pale and cool and a pin prick may not cause bleeding.\\r\\nIn some cases they feel the touch of the hand, but there is no feeling\\r\\nfrom heat. There may also be oversensitiveness to pain and of the skin. It\\r\\nmay be one-sided or both, or only in spots. The left ovarian region is a\\r\\ncommon sensitive point; also over the breasts, lower positions of the\\r\\nribs, on top of the head and over many portions of the backbone. Pain in\\r\\nthe head is a very common and distressing symptom, and is usually on the\\r\\ntop. Pain in the back is common. Abdominal pains may be very severe and\\r\\nthe abdomen may be so tender as to be mistaken for peritonitis. Various\\r\\nparts of the body may have neuralgic pains. There may be intense pain\\r\\naround the heart. There may be complete blindness, the taste and smell may\\r\\nbe disturbed or complete loss of hearing. Third--Paralysis is frequently\\r\\npresent. It may be one-sided or only of the lower extremities, or only one\\r\\nlimb. The face is usually not involved when it is on one side. The leg is\\r\\nmore affected than the arm. Sensation is lessened or lost on the affected\\r\\nside. Paralysis of the lower extremities is more frequent than one-sided\\r\\nparalysis. The power in the limbs hardly ever is entirely lost; the legs\\r\\nmay usually be moved, but the legs give way if the patient tries to stand.\\r\\nThe affected muscles do not waste. The feet are usually extended and turn\\r\\ninward. Sudden loss of voice occurs in many cases. The paralysis is\\r\\ngenerally paroxysmal, and is frequently associated with contractures,\\r\\nshortening of the muscle. The contractures may come on suddenly or slowly,\\r\\nand may last minutes, hours, or months, and some cases even years.\\r\\nMovements of the hands, arms, etc., like the motions in chorea are often\\r\\nseen in the young. A trembling (tremor) is sometimes seen in these\\r\\npatients. It most commonly involves the hands and arms, more rarely the\\r\\nhead and legs. These movements are small and quick. Fourth--Swallowing may\\r\\nbe difficult on account of spasms of the muscles of the pharynx. The\\r\\nlarynx may be involved and interfere with respiration. Indigestion in some\\r\\nform is often present. The stomach and bowels may be very much bloated\\r\\nwith gas. There may be a \"phantom tumor\" in the intestine (bowel).\\r\\nConstipation may be very obstinate, vomiting may be present and persistent\\r\\nand hiccough present. The action of the heart may be irregular, and rapid\\r\\nheart action is common. The least motion may cause difficult breathing and\\r\\nfalse Angina Pectoris (heart pang); the urine is retained not infrequently\\r\\nin female patients.\\r\\n\\r\\n[NERVOUS SYSTEM 285]\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms of the Paroxysms.--Convulsive seizures are common manifestations\\r\\nof hysteria, and frequently present a great similarity to epilepsy. The\\r\\nprodromal (fore-running) symptoms are frequently present and may begin\\r\\nseveral days before the convulsion occurs. In milder forms, in which the\\r\\ncause may be due to a temporary physical exhaustion, or emotional shock,\\r\\nthe fore-running symptoms are of short duration. The patient may become\\r\\nvery nervous, irritable, impatient, have fits of laughing and crying,\\r\\nalternately, or have a feeling of a chill rising in the throat. The\\r\\nconvulsion follows these symptoms. The patient generally falls in a\\r\\ncomfortable place; consciousness is only apparently lost, for she\\r\\nfrequently remembers what has taken place; the tongue is rarely bitten, In\\r\\nthe milder forms the movements are apt to be disorderly. In the severe\\r\\nforms the movements are apt to be a lasting contraction of the muscles and\\r\\nthe patient may have the head and feet drawn back and the abdomen drawn\\r\\nfront. There then may follow a condition of ecstacy, sleepiness,\\r\\ncatalepsy, trance, or the patient may show symptoms of a delirium with the\\r\\nmost extraordinary sights of unreal things. These convulsions may last for\\r\\nseveral hours or days. Firm pressure over the ovaries may bring on a\\r\\nconvulsion, or if made during a convulsion may arrest it. The disease is\\r\\nrarely dangerous to life, yet death has followed exhaustion induced by\\r\\nrepeated convulsions or prolonged fasting. The duration of hysteria is\\r\\nvery uncertain.\\r\\n\\r\\n[286 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nDURING A CONVULSION. The first thing to do is not to be frightened. A\\r\\npatient in a convulsion from hysteria very seldom injures herself during\\r\\nthe convulsions. If you are sure it is hysteria, give a nasty tasting\\r\\nmedicine, asafoetida is a splendid remedy, but not in pill form, for there\\r\\nis no taste or smell to them. Sometimes a convulsion may be arrested by\\r\\nthe sudden use of ice to the backbone or abdomen or by dashing cold water\\r\\nin the face and chest, or by pressing upon the ovaries. When the hysteria\\r\\nis of a mild form it is sometimes a good plan, when the convulsion comes\\r\\non, to place the patient in a comfortable position and then leave her, and\\r\\nwhen the patient comes to and finds herself alone and without sympathy,\\r\\nthe attacks are less likely to be repeated. Sometimes if you watch a\\r\\npatient closely when she is seemingly unconscious, you will see, if you\\r\\nlook at her very guardedly, that one eyelid is not entirely closed, and\\r\\nthat the patient really sees much that is occurring around her. I am\\r\\nwriting of real genuine hysteria, in which the patient is not quite right,\\r\\nnot only physically but mentally,--especially the latter,--during the\\r\\nattack at least. For that and other reasons such patients should not be\\r\\ntreated cruelly.\\r\\n\\r\\nPreventive Treatment of Hysteria.--In order to be successful in this line\\r\\nof treatment the cause must be found and treated. An English physician\\r\\nwrites: \"It is pitiable to think of the misery that has been inflicted on\\r\\nthese unhappy victims of the harsh and unjust treatment which has resulted\\r\\nfrom false views of the nature of the trouble; on the other hand, worry\\r\\nand ill-health, often the wrecking of the mind, body and estate, are\\r\\nentailed upon the near relatives in the nursing of a protracted case of\\r\\nhysteria. The minor manifestations, attacks of the vapors, the crying and\\r\\nweeping spells are not of much moment, and rarely require treatment. The\\r\\nphysical condition should be carefully looked into and the mode of life\\r\\nregulated, so as to insure system and order in everything. A congenial\\r\\noccupation offers the best remedy for many of these manifestations. Any\\r\\nfunctional disturbance should be attended to and a course of tonics\\r\\nprescribed. Special attention should be paid to the action of the bowels.\\r\\nThe best preventive treatment is the one that is given early, when the\\r\\ngirl is growing from childhood to girlhood. It should be begun even\\r\\nearlier. A weakly baby should be built up by proper food and outdoor life.\\r\\nDainties should not be given to such a child. When the child is old\\r\\nenough, as some mothers think, to go to kindergarten school, keep the\\r\\nlittle one at home. It is plenty early enough to send such a child to\\r\\nschool when she is seven years old. This early school work rushes the\\r\\nchild, makes it nervous. If you should happen to listen to the heart of\\r\\nmany young school children you would find it pounding away at a furious\\r\\nrate. Do not hurry a weakly child. Do not hurry or rush a young girl even\\r\\nthough she is strong, from the ages of twelve to sixteen years. Our school\\r\\nsystem does just that. Instead of taking life easy when she is nearing the\\r\\ncrisis (puberty) or is in that period, she is hurried and rushed and\\r\\ncrammed with her school work; the girl frequently goes to school during\\r\\nthis period, even when she is unwell and sits there for an hour or more\\r\\nwith wet skirts and sometimes wet shoes and stockings. Every day I see\\r\\ngirls of all ages go past my office here in this cultured city of Ann\\r\\nArbor, without rubbers, treading through the slush and water. Is it any\\r\\nwonder they become sickly, become victims of hysteria and suffer from\\r\\nmenstrual disorders? Dysmenorrhea must follow such carelessness, and the\\r\\nparents are to blame in many cases. Be careful of your children,\\r\\nespecially girls at this age, care less for their intellectual growth, and\\r\\npay more attention to their body development, even if it should happen to\\r\\nbe at the expense of their intellectual development. A healthy body is\\r\\nbetter than all the knowledge that can be obtained, if it goes, as it too\\r\\noften does, with a body that is weak and sick. Outdoor life is necessary.\\r\\nHorseback riding is splendid; walking is also good exercise at a regular\\r\\ntime each day.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n[NERVOUS SYSTEM 287]\\r\\n\\r\\nPHYSICIANS\\' TREATMENT for Hysteria.--If there is any womb trouble, it must\\r\\nbe attended to. There is frequently trouble with the menses in cases of\\r\\nhysteria. It sometimes comes from anemia or simply comes without any\\r\\nspecial reason. Tonics like arsenic, iron, strychnine and cod-liver oil\\r\\nare needed for anemia. Iron valerate is good, in one grain doses, three\\r\\ntimes a day, in this disease, when the patient is not fleshy.\\r\\n\\r\\n1. The following is recommended by Dr. Goodell:\\r\\n\\r\\n    Of each one scruple (20 grains).\\r\\n      Quinine Valerate\\r\\n      Iron Valerate\\r\\n      Ammonia Valerate\\r\\n\\r\\nMake into twenty pills. Take one or two pills three times a day.\\r\\n\\r\\n(This is a good tonic in such cases.)\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Fowler\\'s Solution of Arsenic in three to five drops doses is frequently\\r\\nused (three times a day) and is a good lasting tonic in cases where the\\r\\npatient has a very pale white looking skin.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Asafoetida in three to five-grain pills is a splendid tonic in such\\r\\ncases, and in that form is pleasant to take. Take three during the day,\\r\\nbefore meals.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Sumbul or musk root is a good remedy. Tincture in one-half dram doses\\r\\nthree times a day. This is good when the patient is very nervous.\\r\\n\\r\\n5. The following is good when anemia is prominent:\\r\\n\\r\\n    Dried Sulphate of Iron        20 grains\\r\\n    Alcoholic extract of Sumbul   20 grains\\r\\n    Asafoetida                    10 grains\\r\\n    Arsenious acid               1/2 grain\\r\\n\\r\\nMix thoroughly and make twenty pills, one after each meal.\\r\\n\\r\\n[288 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\n6. Tincture of hops in doses of one-half to two teaspoonfuls is good for\\r\\nnervousness and sleeplessness, taken at bedtime. It can also be taken\\r\\nregularly four times a day in from one-half to one teaspoonful doses.\\r\\n\\r\\n7. General Cautions.--Proper, easily digested foods must be taken. Keep\\r\\nthe bowels open daily. Let trash and dainties alone. Pies, cakes, and rich\\r\\nfoods are an abomination for such patients. Candy is not to be eaten. Let\\r\\nnovels alone. Go to bed at nine and sleep until six or seven. Bathe five\\r\\nor ten minutes every morning or evening in tepid water or cool water. The\\r\\npatient should be warmly clothed. Sleep in a pleasant, sunshiny and airy\\r\\nroom. In severe forms of the disease the \"Rest Cure\" and feeding described\\r\\nunder Nervous Prostration should be used.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEPILEPSY. (Falling Sickness).--This is an affection of the nervous system,\\r\\ncharacterized by attacks of unconsciousness, with or without convulsion.\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses.--In a large proportion of cases the disease begins before puberty.\\r\\nIt rarely begins after twenty-five. It is more liable to attack females\\r\\nthan males. Heredity is thought by some to play a big role. Dr. Osler\\r\\nsays: \"In our figures it appears to play a minor role.\" Another doctor\\r\\nsays: \"Heredity plays an important role in the production of the disease.\\r\\nBesides epilepsy, insanity, migraine, alcoholism, near relationship of\\r\\nparents (consanguinity) and hysteria are among the more common ancestral\\r\\ntaints observed.\" All factors which impair the health and exhaust the\\r\\nnervous system are predisposing causes. Injury to the head often causes\\r\\nit. Teething, worms, adherent foreskin and clitoris, closing of the\\r\\ninternal opening of the womb, delayed menstruation, are sometimes the\\r\\ncause.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--There are two distinct types. The major attacks--or \"grand\\r\\nmal\"--in which there are severe convulsions with complete loss of\\r\\nconsciousness, etc.; and the minor attacks or \"petit mal,\" in which the\\r\\nconvulsive movements are slight and may be absent, and in which the loss\\r\\nof consciousness is often but momentary or practically absent. In some the\\r\\nattacks occur during the day; in others during the night, and they may not\\r\\nbe noticed for a long time.\\r\\n\\r\\nCharacteristic paroxysm of the Major attacks.--This may be ushered in by a\\r\\nlocalized sensation, known as the Aura, in some part of the body; but it\\r\\nmay come without any warning and suddenly. The convulsions begin suddenly\\r\\nand at first are tonic, that is, it does not change but holds on. Thc\\r\\npatient falls unconscious regardless of the surroundings, and the\\r\\nunconsciousness may be preceded by an involuntary piercing cry. The head\\r\\nis drawn back and often turned to the right. The jaws are fixed (tonic\\r\\nspasm). The fingers are clenched over the thumb and the extremities are\\r\\nstiff. The breathing is affected and the face looks blue. The urine and\\r\\nbowel contents may escape; but this occurs oftener in the next stage. This\\r\\ntonic spasm usually lasts from a few seconds to a half minute when it is\\r\\nsucceeded by the clonic spasm stage.\\r\\n\\r\\n[NERVOUS SYSTEM 289]\\r\\n\\r\\nClonic spasm stage.--In this the contraction of the muscles is\\r\\nintermittent. (Tonic spasm is the opposite condition.) At first there is\\r\\ntrembling, but it gradually becomes more rapid and the limbs are jerked\\r\\nand patient tosses violently about. The muscles of the face are in\\r\\nintermittent motion, the eyes roll, the eyelids are opened and closed\\r\\nconvulsively. The jaws move forcibly and strongly, and the tongue is apt\\r\\nto be caught between the teeth and bitten. The blue look now gradually\\r\\ndecreases. A frothy saliva, which may be bloodstained from the bitten\\r\\ntongue, escapes from the mouth. The urine and bowel contents may escape\\r\\ninvoluntarily. The length of time of this stage is variable. It may last\\r\\ntwo minutes. The contraction becomes less violent and the patient\\r\\ngradually sinks into the condition of deep sleep, when the breathing is\\r\\nnoisy and stertorous, the face looks red and swollen, but no longer\\r\\nbluish. The limbs loose their stiffness and unconsciousness is profound.\\r\\nThe patient, if left alone, will sleep for some hours and then awakes and\\r\\ncomplains only of a dull headache. His mind is apt to be confused. He\\r\\nremembers nothing or little of what has occurred. Afterwards the patient\\r\\nmay be irrational for some time and even dangerous.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe minor attack or \"petit mal.\"--There is a convulsion; a short period of\\r\\nunconsciousness, and this may come at any time, and may be accompanied by\\r\\na feeling of faintness or vertigo. Suddenly, for example, at dinner time\\r\\nthe person stops talking and eating, the eyes are fixed and staring and\\r\\nthe face is slightly pale. The patient usually drops anything he may be\\r\\nholding. The consciousness returns in a moment or two and the patient\\r\\nresumes conversation as if nothing had happened. In other instances there\\r\\nis a slight incoherency or the patient performs some almost automatic\\r\\naction. He may begin to undress himself, and on returning to consciousness\\r\\nfind that he has partially disrobed. He may rub his beard or face, or may\\r\\nspit about in a careless way. An eminent physician states: \"One of my\\r\\npatients, after an attack, was in the habit of tearing anything he could\\r\\nlay his hands on, particularly books; violent actions have been committed\\r\\nand assaults made, frequently giving rise to questions which come before\\r\\ncourt. In the majority of cases of \"petit mal\" (light attacks) convulsions\\r\\nfinally occur, at first slight, but ultimately the grand mal (major\\r\\nattacks) becomes well developed, and the attacks may then alternate.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nRecovery.--The authority above goes on to say: \"This may be given today in\\r\\nthe words of Hippocrates: \\'The prognosis in epilepsy is unfavorable when\\r\\nthe disease is congenital (that is, existing at birth), when it endures to\\r\\nmanhood, and when it occurs in a grown person without any previous cause.\\r\\nThe cure may be attempted in young persons but not in old.\\' \\'\\' Death\\r\\nrarely occurs during the fit, but it may happen if the patient is eating.\\r\\nIf the attacks are frequent and the patient has marked mental disturbance\\r\\nthe conditions are unfavorable. Males have a better outlook than females.\\r\\n\\r\\n[290 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES ]\\r\\n\\r\\nPHYSICIANS\\' TREATMENT.--What to do during the Attack of Epilepsy.--Keep\\r\\nthe patient from injuring himself, loosen the clothing, take off the\\r\\ncollar or anything tight about the neck. Place a cork or spool or\\r\\ntooth-brush handle between the teeth to keep the patient from biting his\\r\\ntongue, but attach a stout cord to the object and hold it in that way.\\r\\n\\r\\nPreventive and general treatment.--In the case of children the parents\\r\\nshould be made to understand that in the great majority of cases epilepsy\\r\\nis incurable. The patients need firm but kind treatment. It does not\\r\\nrender a person incapable of following some occupations. \"Julius Caesar\\r\\nand Napoleon were subjects of epilepsy.\" The disease causes gradual\\r\\nimpairment of the mind, and if such patients become extremely irritable or\\r\\nshow signs of violence, they should be placed under supervision in an\\r\\nasylum. A person with this disease should not marry.\\r\\n\\r\\nDiet.--Give the patient a light diet at regular hours, and the stomach\\r\\nshould never be overloaded. There are cases in which meat is injurious,\\r\\nand it should not be eaten more than once a day and at noon time. A\\r\\nvegetable diet seems best. The patient should not go to sleep until the\\r\\ndigestion is completed in the stomach.\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses.--Should be removed if possible. Circumcision should be done,\\r\\nespecially in the young. In case of a female child the \"hood of the\\r\\nclitoris\" should be kept free. Undue mental and physical excitement should\\r\\nbe avoided. Systematic exercise should be taken. Baths in cold water in\\r\\nthe morning, if possible, as the skin should be in good working condition.\\r\\n\\r\\nMedicines.--The bromides are the best, and should always be given under\\r\\nproper supervision of a physician or nurse.\\r\\n\\r\\nCaution.--I wish to add that parents should always attend to the seemingly\\r\\nharmless \"fits\" in their young children. It will not do to say they are\\r\\ndue to teething or worms. If they are, the worms at least can be treated\\r\\nand that cause removed. They may be due to too tight opening in the penis.\\r\\nIf that opening is small, or if the foreskin is tight it will make the\\r\\nchild irritable and cause restless sleep. Attend to that immediately. The\\r\\nsame advice applies to female children. The \"cover\" of the \"clitoris\" may\\r\\nbe tight, making the little one nervous; loosen it. If your child keeps\\r\\nits fingers rubbing its private organs there is reason for you to have the\\r\\nparts examined and the cause removed as masturbation often starts in that\\r\\nway. The parts itch and the child tries to stop the itching. These little\\r\\nthings often cause \"big things\" and I am sure \"fits\" can be stopped very\\r\\noften by looking after the private organs in both sexes.\\r\\n\\r\\n[NERVOUS SYSTEM 291]\\r\\n\\r\\nSHAKING PALSY. (Paralysis Agitans).--This is a chronic affection of the\\r\\nnervous system, characterized by muscular weakness, trembling and\\r\\nrigidity.\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses.--It usually occurs after the fortieth year, and is more common in\\r\\nmen than in women. The exciting causes are exposure to cold and wet,\\r\\nbusiness worries, anxieties, violent emotional excitement and specific\\r\\nfevers.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--The four prominent symptoms are trembling, weakness, rigidity,\\r\\nand a peculiar attitude. It generally develops gradually, usually in one\\r\\nor the other hand. There is at first a fine trembling, beginning in the\\r\\nhands or feet, gradually extending to the arms, the legs and sometimes the\\r\\nwhole body. The head is not involved so frequently. This trembling\\r\\n(tremor) consists of rapid, uniform \"shakings.\" At first it may come in\\r\\nspells, but as the disease advances it is continuous. Any excitement makes\\r\\nit worse. It is very marked in the hands. The trembling generally ceases\\r\\nduring sleep. The muscles become rigid and shortened; the head is bent and\\r\\nthe body is bent forward; the arms are flexed (bent) and the thumbs are\\r\\nturned into the palms and grasped by the fingers; the legs are bent,\\r\\nmovement soon becomes impaired and the extremities show some stiffness in\\r\\nmotion. There is great weakness of the muscles and it is most marked,\\r\\nwhere the trembling is most developed. There is no expression on the face,\\r\\nand the person has a slow and measured speech. The walk is very peculiar,\\r\\nand in attempting to walk the steps are short and hurried. The steps\\r\\ngradually become faster and faster, while the body is bent forward and the\\r\\npatient must keep on going faster to keep from falling. It is difficult to\\r\\ngo around in a short circle. The patient cannot change his position in bed\\r\\neasily. The mind is rarely affected.\\r\\n\\r\\nRecovery.--It is an incurable disease. It may run on for twenty years or\\r\\nmore. There may be times of improvement, but the tendency is to grow,\\r\\ngradually worse.\\r\\n\\r\\nPHYSICIANS\\' TREATMENT for Shaking Palsy.--This is simply to make the\\r\\npatient as comfortable as possible. Regulate the diet. The patient should\\r\\nnot worry or have much exercise. Frequent warm baths are sometimes\\r\\nbeneficial with gentle massage of the muscles.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAPHASIA.--A partial or total inability to express thoughts in words or to\\r\\ninterpret perceptions.\\r\\n\\r\\nVarieties.--Motor and sensory aphasia.\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses.--Softening of the brain, tumors of the brain, lesions in syphilis\\r\\nespecially, hemorrhage in the brain, blows on the head, and inflammation\\r\\nof the brain and its covering.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms of Motor Aphasia.--The patient cannot make the muscles of the\\r\\nlarynx, tongue, palate and lips perform their functions and produce\\r\\nspeech. The patient knows what he wishes to say, but cannot pronounce it.\\r\\nThis may be complete or partial. Complete, when the patient can only utter\\r\\nseparate sounds. Partial, when the words are only slightly mispronounced\\r\\nand when some certain words cannot be pronounced at all. In some cases,\\r\\nnouns only or verbs cannot be pronounced. Agraphia, means inability to\\r\\nwrite down the thoughts. Sensory aphasia: word deafness. This is an\\r\\ninability to interpret spoken language. The sound of the word is not\\r\\nrecognized and cannot be recalled; but sounds such as that of an engine\\r\\nwhistle, or an alarm clock, are heard and recognized. Word-blindness: the\\r\\nperson cannot interpret written language. Pharaphrasia: cannot use the\\r\\nright word in continued speech; the patient uses words but misplaces them.\\r\\n\\r\\n[292 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nRecovery depends a great deal upon the cause.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--Treat the cause. If from syphilis, iodide of potash and\\r\\nmercury. If from an injury or tumors, operate if possible. Teach the\\r\\npatient how to speak, read and write. The result of this often gives you a\\r\\npleasant surprise.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Hand Nerves.]\\r\\n\\r\\nWRITERS\\' CRAMP. Causes.--This occurs much oftener in men than in women,\\r\\nand usually between the ages of twenty-five and forty. The predisposing\\r\\ncauses are a nervous constitution, heredity, alcoholism, worry, etc. The\\r\\nchief exciting cause,--excessive writing, especially when it is done\\r\\nunder a strain.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--It usually begins with fatigue, weight, or actual pain in the\\r\\naffected muscles. In the spasm form the fingers are seized with a constant\\r\\nor intermittent spasm whenever the person grasps the pen. The neuralgic\\r\\nform is similar in symptoms but severe pain and fatigue comes with\\r\\nwriting. The tremulous form: In this the hand when used becomes the seat\\r\\nof the decided tremor. The paralytic form: The chief symptoms are\\r\\nexcessive weakness and fatigue of the part and these disappear when the\\r\\npen is laid aside.\\r\\n\\r\\nRecovery.--If taken in time and if the hand is allowed perfect rest, the\\r\\ncondition may improve rapidly. There is, however, a tendency to recur.\\r\\n\\r\\nPHYSICIANS\\' TREATMENT for Writers\\' Cramps.--There must be absolute rest of\\r\\nthe hand. General tonics, such as iron, strychnine, arsenic, and cod-liver\\r\\noil may be needed to tone up the system.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAPOPLEXY.  (Cerebral Hemorrhage).  (Brain Hemorrhage). Causes.--Bleeding\\r\\n(hemorrhage) into the brain substance is almost always due to an affection\\r\\nof the walls of the large or small arteries of the brain, producing\\r\\nrupture and subsequent bleeding. Persons of fifty or over are more subject\\r\\nto it, and it is more common in men than in women. Any disease that will\\r\\ncause degeneration of the arteries, helps to cause it, such as nephritis,\\r\\nrheumatism, syphilis, gout and alcoholism. Nephritis is one of the most\\r\\ncertain causes, because arterio-sclerosis (hardening and decaying of the\\r\\nwalls of the arteries) and hypertrophy of the heart are associated with\\r\\nnephritis, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\n[NERVOUS SYSTEM 293]\\r\\n\\r\\nDirect Causes.--Straining at stool, heavy lifting, anger, rage, fright,\\r\\netc.; paroxysm of whooping-cough or convulsions may cause it in children.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--Sometimes the patient experiences headache, dizziness, paleness\\r\\nor flushing of the face, fullness in the head, ringing in the ears, etc.,\\r\\ntemporary attacks of numbness or peculiar tingling in one-half of the\\r\\nbody. When the bleeding takes place there is usually loss of\\r\\nconsciousness. In the attack:--If the bleeding is extensive the patient\\r\\nfalls suddenly into coma, and this may soon prove fatal. If the bleeding\\r\\nis slight at first and gradually increases, the patient is delirious at\\r\\nfirst, then one arm, then one side, and finally the whole body may become\\r\\nparalyzed, and unconsciousness, and even death may come from the paralysis\\r\\nof the heart and breathing nerve centers. In many cases the patient falls\\r\\nunconscious without previous warning. The face is red, the eyes injected,\\r\\nthe lips are blue, the pulse is full and slow, and the breathing is slow\\r\\nand deep. The head and eyes may be strongly turned to the injured side.\\r\\nThe pupils may be unequal. The paralysis may not be noticed while the\\r\\npatient is unconscious and is quiet. The urine and the bowels contents may\\r\\npass involuntarily or the urine may be retained. Sometimes when the case\\r\\nis very grave the patient does not awake from his deep sleep (coma); the\\r\\npulse becomes very feeble, respiration becomes changed, mucus collects in\\r\\nthe throat, and death may occur in a few hours or days. In other cases the\\r\\nclot in the brain is gradually absorbed, and the patient slowly returns to\\r\\nconsciousness. Sometimes relapses occur. In mild cases instead of deep\\r\\ncoma, there may be only headache, faintness, nausea and vomiting.\\r\\n\\r\\nSubsequent Symptoms.--When the patient improves, consciousness returns,\\r\\nbut there remains a half-side paralysis, hemiplegia, on the side and\\r\\nopposite to that of the seat of the injury in the brain. It may not take\\r\\nin the whole side, only a part. The gait is peculiar. In walking the\\r\\npatient supports the paralyzed arm. In many cases the paralyzed parts\\r\\ngradually regain their functions in a few weeks, but not always complete.\\r\\nThe leg improves more than the arm. There is danger of other attacks. When\\r\\nthe sleep (coma) is very deep, the breathing is embarrassed, with vomiting\\r\\nand prolonged half-consciousness and extension and complete paralysis,\\r\\nthe danger to life is great.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat can I do at once? Loosen the clothing around the neck and waist.\\r\\nRaise the head and shoulders and put cold to the head (ice bag if you have\\r\\nit) and warmth to the feet, legs and hands. Watch the bladder closely. The\\r\\nurine must be drawn frequently in this disease, especially if there is\\r\\nmuch paralysis. It may dribble away, but that is not enough. Look out for\\r\\nbed sores, especially if the sickness is a long one.\\r\\n\\r\\n[294 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nAPOPLEXY. 1. Mothers\\' Remedies, Simple yet Effective Remedy for.--\"Place\\r\\nthe feet of the patient in hot water and mustard,\" This is a very simple\\r\\ntreatment for such a serious disease, but very often will relieve as the\\r\\nhot bath will cause a reaction, take the pressure of blood from the brain\\r\\nand by this means has been known to save many lives.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Apoplexy, Simple Injection for.-\"Place dry salt on the tongue and give\\r\\nan injection as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n    Warm water       1 quart\\r\\n    Common salt      2 teaspoonfuls\\r\\n    Brandy         1/2 ounce\\r\\n\\r\\n    This injection is recommended for any kind of a shock which affects\\r\\n    the circulation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n    The injection of the bowels will relieve the congestion by drawing the\\r\\n    blood away from the brain.\\r\\n\\r\\nMedical treatment must be to regulate the diet, bowels, kidneys, and\\r\\nstomach. Restore the general health.\\r\\n\\r\\nCaution.--A person who has had an attack of this kind may have another.\\r\\nThe mode of life must be changed in most cases. The patient must take\\r\\nthings easy. The bowels, kidneys, stomach, and liver must work naturally\\r\\nand the stomach must not be overloaded. Too much meat must not be eaten;\\r\\nalcohol must be let alone; rich foods are prohibited. Hurry, worry, anger,\\r\\nfright, excitement, etc., are bad. Be lazy, take life easy, do not get\\r\\nover-heated, and sleep, sleep, SLEEP,--in a room where there is plenty of\\r\\ngood air. Do not lift or strain to have a passage of the bowels. Stooping\\r\\nis injurious. The blood must be kept from the head. Take proper care and\\r\\nyou are likely to live years longer. And now you may wonder why I give\\r\\nsuch cautions. Apoplexy is directly due to a breaking of the wall of a\\r\\nblood vessel, large or small; due to a weakening, or decay, or\\r\\ndegeneration of the wall. This lets the blood into the substance of the\\r\\nbrain and presses upon the nerve centers, causing the trouble and\\r\\nparalysis. Any wrong action tends to fill the blood vessels very full and\\r\\nthe weakened wall bursts.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPALSY. Paralysis.--A loss of movement, entire or partial, in the voluntary\\r\\nmuscles of the body. When this loss of power is complete it is called\\r\\nparalysis; when it is not complete, paresis.\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses.--Inflammation of the brain and spinal cord, tumors in these parts,\\r\\naccidents and injuries, poisons, apoplexy, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--The patient cannot make all the usual motions of the part. The\\r\\naffected muscles may waste after a time.\\r\\n\\r\\nDifferent Varieties.--\\r\\n\\r\\n(a) Paralysis of the ocular (eye) muscles.--The vision becomes double, the\\r\\neyelids do not act normally, may droop. The eye may not move in every\\r\\ndirection as it should.\\r\\n\\r\\n(b) Paralysis of the muscles of mastication (eating). Symptoms.--If\\r\\nparalysis is only on one side, it is difficult to chew; if on both sides,\\r\\nchewing is impossible. The jaw hangs down.\\r\\n\\r\\n[NERVOUS SYSTEM 295]\\r\\n\\r\\n(c) Paralysis of the facial (face) muscle.--This is a rather common\\r\\noccurrence, and is due to exposure to wet, and cold, diseases of the\\r\\nmiddle ear, tumors, etc. Symptoms:--The eyelids do not close tightly, and\\r\\ntears are continually trickling over the cheek; the corner of the mouth\\r\\ndroops and the saliva runs out, etc. The mild cases last two or three\\r\\nweeks; the severe form from four to six weeks; the worst cases usually\\r\\nrecover in a long time.\\r\\n\\r\\n(d) Paralysis of the muscles of the upper extremity.--There are various\\r\\nand many symptoms, but with all there is the same loss of the usual\\r\\nmotion. That particular muscle does not do its special work; for instance,\\r\\nif the paralysis is of the deltoid muscle of the arm and shoulder, it is\\r\\nnot possible to raise the arm, usually pain in the shoulder. The muscle\\r\\nsoon wastes and the head of the arm bone (humerus) falls away from the\\r\\nshoulder, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\n(e) Paralysis of the muscles of the lower extremities.--Paralysis of the\\r\\n\"Gluteus Maximus and Minimus.\" (Hip muscles). Lifting up of the thigh is\\r\\ndifficult and so is walking up hill or rising from sitting position. The\\r\\ntoes are turned out. The other muscles may be paralyzed and simply cannot\\r\\ndo their usual duty.\\r\\n\\r\\n(f) Toxic (poison) paralysis. Lead paralysis.--It is hard to extend the\\r\\nfingers. The lead line is shown on the gums.\\r\\n\\r\\nPHYSICIANS\\' TREATMENT for Palsy.--Remove the cause. Give salts and iodide\\r\\nof potash. Paralysis from arsenic, mercury, zinc or copper:--The symptoms\\r\\nare those of neuritis and are greatly similar in each kind. The spongy\\r\\ngums show mercury; the puffy face and diarrhea show arsenic poison. Remove\\r\\nthe cause.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCONGESTION OF THE BRAIN. (Diseases of the Cerebral (Brain) Circulation).\\r\\n(Hyperaemia).--The brain is too full of blood.\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses. For Active Congestion.--Over-exertion in study, etc.; chronic\\r\\npletbora (too much blood in the blood vessels); from constant use of\\r\\nalcohol, tobacco, amyl nitrite, and from the stomach.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor passive congestion.--Local obstruction to the return of blood from the\\r\\nbrain. Prolonged mental and physical exertion with excesses and irregular\\r\\nliving may cause it.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms of active kind.--Head feels warm, face is red, the arteries in\\r\\nthe neck beat hard, violent headache, ears ringing, very restless and does\\r\\nnot sleep well.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms of the passive form.--The headache is not so great; there may be\\r\\nstupor, drowsiness and dull intellect and very sleepy.\\r\\n\\r\\nRecovery.--Favorable if the cause is removed.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment for active congestion.--Keep the patient absolutely quiet in a\\r\\ndark, well aired room, with the head and shoulders raised, an ice bag or\\r\\ncold cloths to the head and warm applications to the hands and feet. A\\r\\nwarm foot bath will aid in drawing the blood away from the head. Give\\r\\nsalts (salines) to move the bowels. These take away a great deal of water\\r\\nfrom the blood and aid in relieving the congestion of the head.\\r\\n\\r\\n[296 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment for passive congestion.--Remove the cause if possible. Give a\\r\\nlight nutritious diet; prohibit alcohol in any form; keep the bowels\\r\\nregular.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCEREBRAL ANEMIA. (Too little blood in the brain). Causes.--Heart disease,\\r\\ngeneral anemia, and mental excitement.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--\"Fainting spells,\" dizziness, the ears ring and there are spots\\r\\nbefore the eyes; nausea and vomiting may go ahead of the fainting spells.\\r\\nThe face is pale, the pupils are dilated, the pulse is small and feeble,\\r\\nand there may be cold sweating on the body. If you can remove the cause\\r\\nthe result is favorable.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--For the fainting fits:--Place the patient in the \"lying down\"\\r\\nposition and this frequently restores consciousness; loosen any tight\\r\\nclothes, corset, waist, collar, etc. Give plenty of fresh air and do not\\r\\ncrowd. Keep quiet yourself; do not get excited. In mild cases, mild\\r\\nstimulants may be necessary. Let the patient smell of camphor, put a cloth\\r\\nwith camphor or ammonia near the nose. In other cases amylnitrite and\\r\\nstrychnine may be necessary. Small doses of whisky or brandy frequently\\r\\nhelp. Remove the cause. Give tonics for general anemia.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTUMORS OF THE BRAIN AND INFLAMMATION, Abscess, etc. Abscess.\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses.--This is always secondary and comes from some other part of the\\r\\nbody. It comes often in young and middle life and is more common in males\\r\\nthan in females. The most frequent cause is inflammation of the ear and\\r\\nthe next is from fracture of the skull bones. It may be large or small.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--May come slowly or quickly. After an injury to the head the\\r\\nsymptoms may come on suddenly such as intense headache, delirium,\\r\\nvomiting, chills, high fever, and sometimes convulsions, and a very deep\\r\\nseeming sleep (coma). In chronic cases the symptoms are not so severe.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--An operation if the abscess can be reached. If not, an ice bag\\r\\nshould be applied to the head; quiet the distress with narcotics.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTUMORS OF THE BRAIN.--Varieties in order of their frequency. Gumma,\\r\\ntuberculous tumors, glioma, sarcoma, cancer, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses. Predisposing.--Men are about twice as often affected as women\\r\\nuntil fifty and then it is about equal. It is more frequent in early adult\\r\\nlife. The exciting causes are blows and severe emotional shock.\\r\\n\\r\\nGumma (in third stage of Syphilis) appear as a round, yellow, cheesy mass,\\r\\nusually beginning in the membranes and are usually seen between thirty and\\r\\nfifty. They come from syphilis.\\r\\n\\r\\n[NERVOUS SYSTEM 297]\\r\\n\\r\\nTuberculous tumors. These appear as hard masses and vary in size. They may\\r\\nbe single or many, and are situated in any part of the brain. More than\\r\\nhalf of the tumors appearing in children are of this variety.\\r\\n\\r\\nGlioma. \"Glue-tumor.\" They come from tissue forming the basis of the\\r\\nsupporting framework of the nervous tissue. This kind occurs often in the\\r\\nyoung.\\r\\n\\r\\nSarcoma and Cancer are rare.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--The most of the growths start in the membranes of the brain,\\r\\nand by compressing a certain part of the brain they produce their special\\r\\nsymptoms such as headache, vomiting, inflammation of the nerves of the\\r\\neye, double vision, blindness, the memory impaired, dullness and apathy,\\r\\nan irritable temper, and sometimes become demented. There is often vertigo\\r\\nor a sense of giddiness. There may be convulsions, and paralysis of some\\r\\nmuscles. A general tuberculosis tendency or history of syphilis will help\\r\\nto make the diagnosis. In children it is more likely to be tuberculous.\\r\\nThe result is more favorable in tuberculous growths in children and\\r\\nsyphilitic tumors in adults. It may last from a few months to three years\\r\\nin a bad case.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--For gumma, caused by syphilis, iodide of potash and mercury\\r\\nshould be given. In both kinds, syphilitic and tuberculous, a nutritious\\r\\ndiet and general tonic treatment, such as cod-liver oil, iron, arsenic,\\r\\nand quinine should be given. The bowels must be kept open and special\\r\\nattention given to the digestion.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor headache.--Ice bags, cold to the head, mustard to the nape of the\\r\\nneck.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor Vomiting.--Mustard over the stomach. Surgery is necessary for some\\r\\ntumors that can be reached. You will naturally depend upon your attending\\r\\nphysician for advice and treatment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSYPHILIS OF THE BRAIN. Causes.--The symptoms of syphilis of the brain,\\r\\nbelong to the third stage of the disease, and are rarely ever observed\\r\\nuntil at least one year or longer from the time of the first lesion\\r\\n(chancre). It may be from ten to twenty years coming on. Both sexes are\\r\\nequally liable, and it may come at any age. Syphilis may produce a\\r\\ncircumscribed tumor, a disease of the arteries or a general hardened\\r\\ninfiltration of the brain. The tumors are small, yellowish, and cheesy in\\r\\nthe center. They originate in the \"Dura Mater\" (covering) and spread to\\r\\nthe brain structure proper. The disease of the arteries causes a\\r\\nthickening of these vessels, a narrowing of the blood channel in them,\\r\\nthus producing a clot.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--Of gumma (syphilis tumors) at the base of the brain, are\\r\\npersistent headache, worse at night; sleeplessness, depression of the\\r\\nmind, memory impaired, vertigo, sometimes vomiting and paralysis of some\\r\\nof the nerves (third and sixth pairs). Violent convulsions, like epilepsy,\\r\\nappear in some cases.\\r\\n\\r\\n[298 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms when arteries are diseased.--Temporary loss of speech, numbness\\r\\nor weakness in one limb, the sight is disturbed, or vertigo; and, when the\\r\\nclot (thrombus) appears, symptoms of apoplexy, This is a common variety of\\r\\nsyphilis of the brain.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow to tell what the disease is.--The history of the patient will help. An\\r\\napoplexy in a young person would suggest syphilis.\\r\\n\\r\\nRecovery.--The chances are better when the disease forms gumma (tumors)\\r\\nthan when the blood vessels are diseased.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--Should be begun and properly carried on when the person has\\r\\nthe primary sore (chancre), and then these after troubles may not follow.\\r\\nThis is one of the diseases where the victim reaps a big harvest on\\r\\naccount of the sexual sin, and in order to escape the bad results for\\r\\nhimself, etc. he should go through a regular course of treatment when he\\r\\nfirst contracts the disease, perhaps for a year or more, This treatment\\r\\nshould last as a rule for some years. It is late to begin when the brain\\r\\nsymptoms show brain involvement. For this there must be radical and\\r\\ncareful treatment with mercury and iodide of potash; with tonics and\\r\\ngeneral building up treatment, and then even if the patient lives he may\\r\\nbe a nuisance to himself and others.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGENERAL PARESIS. (Paretic dementia. General Paralysis of the Insane.\\r\\nSoftening of the Brain).--This belongs under diseases of the mind, but\\r\\nthere are so many cases that a description of this disease may be\\r\\ninstructive and interesting. One author says: \"General paresis is a\\r\\nchronic, progressive, diffuse, encephalitis (inflammation of the brain),\\r\\nresulting in structural changes in the cerebral (brain) tissue, with\\r\\ninvolvement of the cortical, and meningeal, (covering) blood and lymph\\r\\nvessels, presenting characteristic symptoms, with progressive course and\\r\\nfatal termination usually within three years.\" There are three stages:--1.\\r\\nThe period of incubation (the prodromal stage). 2. A stage of pronounced\\r\\nmono-maniac activity with symptoms of paralysis. 3. Stage of extreme\\r\\nenfeeblement with diminution and final loss of power. These stages run\\r\\ninto each other. First stage in a typical case:--There are tremblings and\\r\\nslight trouble in speech and expression of the face. The mind has exalted\\r\\nand excited spells, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--The patient is irritable. The mental and moral character is\\r\\nunstable. His affairs are in confusion. He uses bad language, neglects his\\r\\nfamily, goes with drunkards and bad women, makes indecent proposals to\\r\\nrespectable women of his acquaintance without realizing that it is\\r\\nimproper. He cannot keep his mind on one thing. Speech is a little thick,\\r\\nindistinct and hesitating. Syllables are dropped or repeated, speech\\r\\nfinally becomes undistinguishable. He is very excited; he thinks he is\\r\\npersecuted. He is a big fellow generally. He is a king, he is rich and\\r\\nmighty. This is the usual run. As the disease progresses he becomes\\r\\nfeeble-minded more and more so continually. Persistent insomnia comes on\\r\\nearly and frequently recurring, one-sided headache often goes with it.\\r\\nSometimes there is an uncontrollable desire to sleep. Loss of\\r\\nconsciousness is an early symptom. After severe attacks there may be\\r\\none-sided paralysis (hemiplegia) which usually disappears in a few hours\\r\\nor days. Convulsions like epilepsy may appear early, but usually occur in\\r\\nthe later stages. The pupils are mostly dilated, rarely contracted, and\\r\\nthey are often unequal and react slowly to light. When the tongue is\\r\\nprotruded it trembles and is put out in a jerky manner. The hands tremble,\\r\\nin the advanced stage. The speech is jerky and slow. Syllables are dropped\\r\\nand repeated. One early symptom is retention of the urine. There is\\r\\nanother annoying symptom--a constant grinding of the teeth. The walk is\\r\\nvery spasmodic, but in advanced stages it becomes slouching or dragging.\\r\\nThe skin may be red or blue. When the feeble-mindedness is fully developed\\r\\nthe mind does not perceive anything accurately. He sees imaginary things,\\r\\nand things that he does see do not appear to him as they are. Finally he\\r\\nhas no mind.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--The end is sure. You can relieve the distress partly. Personal\\r\\nattention by a physician is needed.\\r\\n\\r\\n[NERVOUS SYSTEM 299]\\r\\n\\r\\nINSOMNIA.--Insomnia is not a disease, but a symptom of disease. It may,\\r\\nhowever, become so active, prominent, and important a symptom as to\\r\\nconstitute a condition which merits individual management and treatment.\\r\\n\\r\\nDefinition.--Insomnia is the term employed to denote actual or absolute\\r\\nsleeplessness, and also lack of fully restful sleep, which might be termed\\r\\nrelative sleeplessness.\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses.--Organic causes. Disease of the brain and spinal cord. Toxic\\r\\ncauses due to poison circulating in the blood which by irritation of the\\r\\nbrain and cord (axis) and especially of the brain, cause such diseases as\\r\\nnephritis (chronic), jaundice, typhoid fever and consumption.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrimary causes. Depend upon insanity.\\r\\n\\r\\nNervous or simplest causes.--These are present in nervous persons and\\r\\ncomprise the two conditions of congestion and anemia of the brain. The\\r\\nbrain congestion is typified by the nerve-tire of the student; over-study\\r\\nand anxiety bring too much blood to the brain and necessarily too much\\r\\nactivity and then insomnia. Anemia of the brain acts in the opposite\\r\\nmanner. The brain cells are not properly nourished and hence irritated,\\r\\nand sleeplessness follows.\\r\\n\\r\\nSLEEPLESSNESS. Mothers\\' Remedies. 1. Hop Pillow Stops.--\"People affected\\r\\nin this way will be very much benefited by the use of a pillow composed of\\r\\nhops, or cup of warm hop tea on retiring. The hops have a very soothing\\r\\neffect upon the nerves.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Sleeplessness, Easy and Simple Remedy for.--\"On going to bed, take some\\r\\nsound, as a clock-tick or the breathing of some one within hearing, and\\r\\nbreathe long breaths, keeping time to the sound. In a very short time you\\r\\nwill fall asleep, without any of the painful anxieties attending\\r\\ninsomnia.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n[300 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Sleeplessness, Ginger at Bedtime for.--\"Ginger tea taken at bedtime\\r\\nsoothes one to sleep,\" This is a very good remedy when the stomach is at\\r\\nfault. It stimulates this organ and produces a greater circulation,\\r\\nthereby drawing the blood from the head. This will make the patient feel\\r\\neasier and sleep will soon follow.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Sleeplessness, Milk Will Stop.--\"Sip a glass of hot milk just before\\r\\nretiring. This is very soothing to the nerves, and a good stimulant for\\r\\nthe stomach,\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPHYSICIANS\\' TREATMENT.--Remove the cause and be careful in using drugs. In\\r\\nthe organic kind the treatment is not very successful. In the toxic kind\\r\\ndrugs must be given to correct other diseases and also tonics given. For\\r\\nbrain congestion and anemia kind other means must be used first, and the\\r\\ndrugs as the last resort. Treatment of the congestive insomnia.--1. Hot or\\r\\nwarm general body-baths are very advantageous to stimulate the circulation\\r\\nand restore its balance alike in congestion and anemic cases. After such\\r\\nbaths the patient must go to bed at once and not get chilled in cold rooms\\r\\nor by drafts. They must be properly covered and kept warm.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Cold spongings, cold shower baths, or cold plunge baths are given when\\r\\nthe hot or warm bath does not produce the correct result. If this does not\\r\\ndepress it is better than the warm bath. The person should be rubbed with\\r\\nwarm rough towels until the skin is aglow. If he feels rested and quieted,\\r\\nthe reaction is proper; if depressed, the treatment is too vigorous and\\r\\nnot suitable.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. The patient should stand ankle deep in a tub of hot water and a \"drip\\r\\nsheet,\" from water at 75 to 80 degrees temperature, thrown over him. Then\\r\\nrub the patient\\'s back and abdomen hard and a general brisk rub-down\\r\\nimmediately after leaving the tub. This treatment should quiet, not excite\\r\\nor depress.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. The cold abdominal pack is valuable. Flannel is wrung out in water, 75\\r\\nto 80 degrees temperature and laid in several thicknesses upon the\\r\\nabdomen; place a dry towel over this, cover all with oiled silk,\\r\\noverlapping widely in order to protect the bed. Tie or bandage all this\\r\\nfirmly. The effect of this work is first that of a cold then of a warm\\r\\npoultice.\\r\\n\\r\\n5. Exercise. This should be in the open air when possible. A fast walk,\\r\\nhorseback ride or ride on bicycle for a half hour before bedtime, followed\\r\\nby a rub-down will frequently give a good sleep. Dumb-bell, Indian club\\r\\nexercise, chest weight, are good in some cases.\\r\\n\\r\\nDiet.--A light easily digested supper is often better than a heavy meal.\\r\\nSometimes a little eaten before bed-time will give sleep. A piece of\\r\\ntoast, for instance. It draws the blood from the brain and more to the\\r\\nstomach.\\r\\n\\r\\n[NERVOUS SYSTEM 301]\\r\\n\\r\\nMedicines. If you must use them.--The bromides are the best. Sodium and\\r\\nstrontium bromide are first choice. Twenty to thirty grains in water\\r\\none-half hour before retiring. Chloral hydrate should not be used often.\\r\\nSulphonal, trional, etc., should always be given with a little food-never\\r\\nalone. Sometimes bread pills do just as well.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nANEMIC CONGESTION. Diet.--A light supper before retiring, like hot milk,\\r\\nbroths, milk punch, etc., will very frequently promote sleep by removing\\r\\nthe cause and quickening the circulation. Give nutritious, easy food to\\r\\ndigest. The baths are not so valuable for this kind of insomnia. A cold\\r\\nsponge bath or plunge may be of service.\\r\\n\\r\\nMedicines.--Tonics are needed here as in regular anemia. The patient must\\r\\nbe carefully treated, and very many of these cases can be cured. The\\r\\npatient must render all the aid he can give, and the physician should gain\\r\\nhis confidence. If he does he will not need to give much medicine to put\\r\\nthe patient to sleep, and if he does give it he can frequently use a\\r\\nPlacebo with the same effect. Mind has an influence over mind. By\\r\\n\"Placebo\" is meant any harmless substance, as bread-pills, given to soothe\\r\\nthe patient\\'s anxiety rather than as a remedy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSLEEP WALKING.--There is a tendency to sleep walking in some families,\\r\\noften more than one child will do this to a greater or less extent. It is\\r\\nvery extreme in some cases, and the next morning they do not know anything\\r\\nabout it. The person is very seldom hurt and he can do some dizzy things.\\r\\nMany persons walk about in their sleeping room or simply get out of bed.\\r\\nFatigue, worry, poor sleep, restlessness, nervousness, a hearty late\\r\\ndinner are aggravating causes. As age advances and the person becomes\\r\\nstronger, the patient will do less of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--Avoid over-eating, worry, over-study. The evening should be\\r\\nspent quietly. Such persons had better drop parties, late hours or\\r\\nanything that tends to cause worry, fatigue or nervousness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSTAMMERING.--This may be inherited to some extent; excitement,\\r\\nnervousness, bodily fatigue, want of rest, etc., make it worse.\\r\\n\\r\\nMOTHER\\'S REMEDY. 1. Stammering, Easy Cure for.--\"Read aloud in a room an\\r\\nhour each day. Repeat each word slowly and distinctly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPHYSICIANS\\' TREATMENT.--The person should be taught early to talk slowly,\\r\\nand to do everything to control himself and not get nervous. There are\\r\\nschools for this trouble, and they seem to do good work. They teach the\\r\\npatients how to speak slowly, distinctly and to keep their minds off of\\r\\nthemselves.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHICCOUGH.--This is caused by intermittent, sudden contraction of the\\r\\ndiaphragm; obstinate hiccough is a very distressing symptom and sometimes\\r\\nit is hard to control.\\r\\n\\r\\n302       MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses.--Inflammatory causes. It is seen in gastritis, peritonitis,\\r\\nhernia, appendicitis, and in severe forms of typhoid fever. Irritative\\r\\ncauses. Swallowing hot substances, local disease of the gullet near the\\r\\ndiaphragm, and in many cases of stomach trouble and bowel disorder,\\r\\nespecially when associated with gas (flatus). Specific causes: Gout,\\r\\ndiabetes or chronic Bright\\'s disease. Nervous (Neurotic) causes. Hysteria,\\r\\nepilepsy, shock, or brain tumors.\\r\\n\\r\\nMOTHERS\\' REMEDIES. 1. Hiccough. Vinegar for.--\"One teaspoonful vinegar\\r\\nsipped carefully (so it will not strangle the patient) will stop them\\r\\nalmost instantly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Hiccough, Sugar and Vinegar Stops.--\"A few drops of strong vinegar\\r\\ndropped on a lump of sugar and held in the mouth until dissolved, will\\r\\nstop most cases of hiccoughs.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Hiccough, Sugar Will Relieve Patient of.--\"Place a little dry sugar on\\r\\nthe end of the tongue and hold the breath. I have tried this remedy after\\r\\nothers have failed and obtained instant relief.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Hiccough, Simple Remedy for.--\"Have patient hold both ears closed with\\r\\nthe fingers, then give them three swallows cold water while they hold\\r\\ntheir breath.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n5. Hiccough, Home Remedy to Stop.--\"Take nine swallows of cold water while\\r\\nholding the breath.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n6. Hiccough. Vinegar Stops.--\"One teaspoonful of vinegar thickened with\\r\\nsugar and eaten slowly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n7. Hiccough, Cinchona Bark in Peppermint Stops.--\"Put about one-fourth\\r\\nteaspoonful of cinchona bark, powdered in two ounces of peppermint water,\\r\\nand give one teaspoonful every five or ten minutes until relieved, or\\r\\nthree drops of camphor and aqua ammonia in wineglassful of water,\" These\\r\\nremedies are very good when the stomach is at fault, as they have a\\r\\nstimulating effect.\\r\\n\\r\\nPHYSICIANS\\' TREATMENT.--Sudden start may check it in the light forms. Ice,\\r\\na teaspoonful of salt and lemon juice may be tried. Inhalations of\\r\\nchloroform often relieve. Strong retraction of the tongue may give\\r\\nimmediate relief. Spirits of camphor, one teaspoonful. Tincture of cayenne\\r\\npepper one to two drops in water. Ten grains of musk by the rectum.\\r\\nHoffman\\'s anodyne one teaspoonful in ice water is very good.\\r\\n\\r\\n[NERVOUS SYSTEM 303]\\r\\n\\r\\nINJURIES TO THE HEAD. Concussion or Laceration of the Brain.--The brain\\r\\nmay be injured by a blow on the head, or indirectly by falling fully upon\\r\\nthe feet or sitting down hard upon the buttocks.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--The person who is injured may lose his balance and fall, become\\r\\npale, confused, and giddy, may have nausea and vomiting and recover. If\\r\\nthe injury is more severe and there is a tear of the membranes of the\\r\\nbrain or the brain itself, the patient will fall and lie quietly with a\\r\\nfeeble and fluttering heart, cold, clammy skin, and apparent\\r\\nunconsciousness; he can be roused by shouting but will not reply\\r\\nintelligently. He will be able to move his limbs. The urine and contents\\r\\nof the bowels will be passed involuntarily. As he gets better he may\\r\\nvomit. He may soon return to entire consciousness, but still suffer from\\r\\nsome headache, feel wearied, and tired, and not feel like exerting\\r\\nhimself. This may continue for some time. Occasionally the results are\\r\\nmore serious even after a long time has passed, and an abscess of the\\r\\nbrain should be watched for, sometimes epilepsy or insanity follows. If\\r\\nthe patient grows worse instead of recovering, either deep seeming sleep\\r\\nsets in or symptoms of inflammation of the covering (meninges) or the\\r\\nbrain itself follows. Such injuries must be carefully watched, for you can\\r\\nnot tell at first how severe they may prove to be.\\r\\n\\r\\nTREATMENT. What to do First.--Put the patient to bed without any pillow,\\r\\nand put around his body hot water bottles or bags, suitably covered. He\\r\\nshould be kept quiet and free from excitement, and sleep should be\\r\\nencouraged. Hot water or ice water, when awake, as is most agreeable to\\r\\nthe patient, may be given. Aromatic spirit of ammonia, during the shock is\\r\\nbetter for the patient to take than alcohol, for alcohol excites the\\r\\nbrain; dose, one-half to two drams; the former can be given every ten\\r\\nminutes in a little water for about three doses. Surgical treatment may be\\r\\nnecessary at any time.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nINJURIES OF THE SPINAL CORD. Concussion of the Spine.--A severe jarring of\\r\\nthe body followed by a group of spinal symptoms supposed to be due to some\\r\\nminute changes in the cord, of an unknown nature.\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses.--Severe concussion may result from railway accidents or violent\\r\\nbending of the body, fall from a house, blow on the back, jumping, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--May come on suddenly, when it is due to a jar of the brain as\\r\\nwell as the cord. Loss of consciousness, complete paralysis, small pulse,\\r\\ncollapse, and within a few hours death may follow. In other cases\\r\\nimprovement, though very slow, follows. Walking is difficult and the upper\\r\\nextremities are weak in these cases. There are pain and tenderness along\\r\\nthe spine. Brain symptoms, such as headache, dizziness and fainting, may\\r\\nbe present or absent.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--Absolute rest from the beginning, stimulants if necessary,\\r\\nelectricity is useful.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTRAUMATISM OF THE CORD. (Blows, etc.).--(Fractures and dislocations,\\r\\ngunshot and stab wounds, etc.).\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--They differ according to the place where the cord is injured.\\r\\nThe motion and feeling power may be disturbed. There may be sudden\\r\\ncomplete paralysis of the upper and lower extremities depending on how\\r\\nseverely the cord is injured, and how high up the injury is. The bladder\\r\\nand rectum may not act properly. The contents may be retained or\\r\\n\"run-away.\" Death follows sooner or later if the injury is extensive. In\\r\\nsome cases the symptoms are slight in the beginning, but increase in a few\\r\\ndays, or they may suddenly increase a few months afterwards. In other\\r\\ncases, bad symptoms at first may gradually abate which is due to the blood\\r\\nclot having been absorbed.\\r\\n\\r\\n[304  MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES ]\\r\\n\\r\\nRecovery depends upon the extent of the injury and the constitution of the\\r\\npatient. It is always well to be careful about expressing an opinion about\\r\\nthis injury.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment. Immediate.--Surgical treatment is necessary. Absolute rest is a\\r\\nnecessity, and must be had for weeks according to the severity of the\\r\\ncase. It may seem long and become tedious, but the case must have rest for\\r\\na long time.\\r\\n\\r\\nORGANIC DISEASES OF THE SPINAL CORD. Caisson Disease; Divers\\' Paralysis.\\r\\nCauses.--This affection occurs in divers, bridge builders, and others who\\r\\nare subject to increased atmospheric pressure. The symptoms develop on\\r\\ncoming suddenly to the surface when the atmospheric pressure is greatly\\r\\nlessened.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--They usually occur on the return to the surface of the water,\\r\\nor after a few hours have passed. There are pains in the ears and joints\\r\\nand nose-bleed. The pulse is slow and strong. Neuralgia of the stomach and\\r\\nvomiting often occur. Paralysis of one side, or of the lower extremities\\r\\nmay occur. Brain symptoms may develop and death may follow in a few hours.\\r\\nIn most cases recovery takes place in a few days or weeks.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--Persons who are engaged in such work should change very\\r\\ngradually from a great depth to the surface, and should not go into the\\r\\nouter air suddenly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMYELITIS.--Myelitis is an inflammation of the spinal cord.\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses.--It may occur at any age, and is more common in male than in\\r\\nfemale. The exciting causes are prolonged exposure to severe colds, too\\r\\ngreat mental and physical exertion, sexual excess, blows, bleeding into\\r\\nthe cord, alcoholic excess, acute infectious diseases, syphilis, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--These depend upon the location of the inflammation and the\\r\\nseverity. The onset may be sudden or gradual--when it is sudden, there may\\r\\nbe a chill followed by a fever of 101 to 103 degrees--general feeling of\\r\\nillness, loss of appetite, with coated tongue and constipation. There may\\r\\nbe over-sensitiveness to pain and touch. Pain may radiate from the back\\r\\ninto the limbs, with numbing and tingling of the limbs. The urine may be\\r\\nretained or may dribble away. Usually there is obstinate constipation.\\r\\nThere is frequently the feeling of a band around the body. Paralysis may\\r\\nfollow in the lower extremities and higher up, sometimes, depending upon\\r\\nhow high up in the cord the inflammation exists. This paralysis may cause\\r\\nno motion of the limbs or produce an exaggerated contracting of the\\r\\naffected muscles, the knees being drawn up on the abdomen and the heels\\r\\ntouching the buttocks.\\r\\n\\r\\n[NERVOUS DISEASES 305]\\r\\n\\r\\nRecovery.--Chances for recovery depend upon the cause. Most cases are\\r\\nchronic and may last for years.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--Treatment depends also upon the cause. Rest in bed;\\r\\ncounter-irritation, wet cupping, with care on account of bed sores. A\\r\\nwater-bed from the first may prevent bed-sores. The urine must be drawn if\\r\\nit is retained. The medical treatment must be carefully given and a\\r\\nphysician of experience should be obtained.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLOCOMOTOR ATAXIA. Tabes dorsalis. Posterior Spinal Sclerosis).--A\\r\\nhardening (sclerosis) affecting the posterior parts of the spinal cord and\\r\\ncharacterized by incoordination, which means a condition where a person is\\r\\nunable to produce voluntary muscular movements; for instance, of the legs,\\r\\netc., loss of deep reflexes to bend them back; disturbances of nutrition\\r\\nand sensation, and various affections of sight.\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses.--This is a disease of adult life, persons under twenty-five being\\r\\nrarely affected, and is more common in men than women (ten to one).\\r\\nSometimes children suffering from hereditary syphilis have it. The chief\\r\\npredisposing cause is syphilis which precedes it in from seventy to\\r\\neighty-five of the cases according to various authorities. Exposure to\\r\\ncold and wet, sexual and alcoholic excesses, mineral poisoning, and great\\r\\nphysical exertion also exciting causes.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--These are numerous. They appear in succession and with the same\\r\\nregularity.\\r\\n\\r\\nStages.--Stages of pain; the stage of ataxia, peculiar gait; and the state\\r\\nof paralysis.\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Prodromal or forerunning; the stage of pain.--This consists of\\r\\nlightning-like pains in the lower extremities, numbness, formication\\r\\n(feeling of ants, etc., crawling), sensation of dead extremities; pins and\\r\\nneedles in the soles of the feet and fingers, coldness, itching of arms\\r\\nand scrotum or other parts, a sensation of constriction around the chest,\\r\\nheadache, pain in the small of the back and loins of an aching character\\r\\nmay occur. These symptoms may constitute the only evidence of locomotor\\r\\nataxia and last for years; but sooner or later there are added absence of\\r\\nknee cap bone reflex (knee jerk), and immobility of the pupil. The loss of\\r\\nthe knee jerk is always observed in time. The pupil fails to respond to\\r\\nlight while it still accommodates for distance, called Argyll Roberston\\r\\npupil. There may be imperfect control of the bladder with slow, dripping\\r\\nor hasty urination. Later the control is not imperfect, but it may be\\r\\npainful. Inflammation of the bladder may occur which is dangerous. There\\r\\nis usually obstinate constipation and loss of sexual power. These symptoms\\r\\nmay last for several months and years, and then the second stage symptoms\\r\\nappear.\\r\\n\\r\\n[306 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Stage of Ataxia (Disturbance of motion).--The disturbance of motion\\r\\n(ataxia) is very marked, especially in the lower extremities; the walking\\r\\nbecomes difficult and uncertain; there is difficulty in rising or rapid\\r\\nturning; the legs are wide apart; feet lifted too high and come down too\\r\\nforcibly; the length of the steps is irregular, and the body is\\r\\nimperfectly balanced. If the patient stands with his feet together and\\r\\neyes closed he begins to sway, (Romberg\\'s symptom), which is due to a\\r\\ndefect in controlling the muscles from impairment of sensation. There may\\r\\nbe imperfect use of the hands in dressing, writing, etc.; lancinating\\r\\npains are marked in all cases and come on in paroxysms. The pains are\\r\\nmostly in the legs, but also occur in the arms, head, loins, back, and\\r\\ntrunk. Then the sense of touch is partially lost. The prick of a pin may\\r\\nnot be felt until a few seconds after being applied. This stage may last\\r\\nfor years and remain at a \"standstill;\" but it is usually progressive, and\\r\\nadvances to the third stage.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. The stage of paralysis is marked by a gradual change to the worse, and\\r\\nthe patient must remain in bed, because he cannot get out. The lower and\\r\\nsometimes the upper extremities have lost a great deal of their power of\\r\\nsensation: The joints, mostly the knee and hip joints show on both sides\\r\\nof the body a painless swelling, owing to the great quantities of watery\\r\\nliquid there. Dislocations and fractures occur simultaneously. Bed-sores\\r\\nand peculiar ulcers on the sole of the foot also occur. The urine dribbles\\r\\naway constantly, for all control of the bladder is lost. Death occurs from\\r\\nexhaustion; bedsores, inflammation of the bladder, or pneumonia coming on\\r\\nas a complication.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment;--The only thing to do when the patient has this disease is to\\r\\nmake him comfortable and arrest the progress of it, if possible. It is\\r\\nincurable, but treatment sometimes arrests the progress and at least\\r\\nlessens the suffering and prolongs life as long as it is worth living to\\r\\nthem. I have given a longer description than was necessary, for I wanted\\r\\nmen who live such fast lives to understand what it brings them for most\\r\\ncases are caused by syphilis. The description could have been made longer\\r\\nand other symptoms and complications put in. I think enough has been given\\r\\nand perhaps this description may deter some one from going the same road.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Diagnosis is made at first by the fatigue, peculiar pains, loss of the\\r\\nknee jerk, the peculiar pupil and history of syphilis. Later it is made\\r\\nfrom the ataxia; the peculiar walk, etc., and the bladder disturbances.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHEREDITARY ATAXIA. Friedrich\\'s Disease.--This peculiar disease is due to a\\r\\ndegenerative disease of the posterior and lateral columns (parts) of the\\r\\nspinal cord, occurring in childhood, and often in several children of the\\r\\nsame family.\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses.--More in boys than in girls and oftener in the country districts.\\r\\nHeredity is frequently a cause and it is traced to syphilis, epilepsy,\\r\\nalcoholism, and insanity in the ancestors. Several children of the same\\r\\nfamily may have it.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--In very young children it is noticed that they are slow in\\r\\nlearning to walk; the child staggers in trying to stand or to walk; it\\r\\nuses its hands clumsily, and has difficulty in speaking. The movements of\\r\\nthe hands are peculiar, the hands move like in chorea, the speech is slow\\r\\nand drawling.\\r\\n\\r\\nRecovery.--Very doubtful, but they may last for years.\\r\\n\\r\\n[NERVOUS DISEASES 307]\\r\\n\\r\\nINFANTILE PARALYSIS. (Acute Anterior Polio Myelitis).--This is an acute\\r\\ndisease occurring almost exclusively in young children with paralysis,\\r\\nfollowed by rapid dwindling of the muscles of the parts affected by the\\r\\nparalysis.\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses.--Found in children under three years old. It is more common in\\r\\nsummer than in winter. It often follows scarlet fever, measles, and\\r\\ndiphtheria.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--The onset is usually sudden; often the child is put to bed at\\r\\nnight seemingly well and in the morning is found paralyzed in one or more\\r\\nlimbs. High fever or chills, general feeling of illness, pain all over the\\r\\nbody, decided brain symptoms, like delirium or convulsions and\\r\\nintermittent contractions of the muscles may usher in the disease. These\\r\\nforerunning symptoms may last a short time or for several weeks, after\\r\\nwhich the paralysis is noticed, being extensive as a rule, and affecting\\r\\none, two, or all of the extremities and sometimes the muscles of the\\r\\ntrunk. This general paralysis soon disappears being left permanently in\\r\\nonly one extremity, chiefly in one leg. The other symptoms disappear. The\\r\\nparalyzed part atrophies (wastes) rapidly. The disease is very rare in\\r\\nadults. If the paralysis does not show a decided change within the first\\r\\nfew months, full recovery is doubtful.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--During the acute stage there must be absolute quiet and rest\\r\\nwith a diet that is not stimulating, one that is easily digested; ice to\\r\\nthe head or cold cloths, counter-irritation to the spine; electricity\\r\\nshould be used after a few weeks. There is quite a good deal of this\\r\\nparalysis, and the case should receive careful attention from the start.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTASTE.--Taste-Buds.--There are three kinds of papillae or eminences on the\\r\\nhuman tongue,--the circumvallate, the fungiform and the filiform. The\\r\\ncircumvallate are from seven to twelve in number and lie near the root of\\r\\nthe tongue, arranged in the form of a V, with its open angle turned\\r\\nforward. Each one is an elevation of the mucous membrane, covered by\\r\\nepithelium and surrounded by a trench. On the sides of the papillae,\\r\\nembedded in the epithelium, are small oval bodies called taste-buds. These\\r\\ntaste-buds consist of a sheath of flattened, fusiform cells, enclosing a\\r\\nnumber of spindle-like cells whose tapering ends are prolonged into a\\r\\nhair-like process. As the filaments of the gustatory nerves terminate\\r\\nbetween these rod-like cells, it is probable that they are the true\\r\\nsensory cells of taste.\\r\\n\\r\\n[308 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the human tongue taste-buds are also found in the fungiform papillae,\\r\\noften seem as red dots scattered over its surface; and to an area just in\\r\\nfront of the anterior pillar of the fauces. It is also possible that\\r\\nsingle taste-cells are scattered over the tongue, as the sense of taste\\r\\nexists where no taste-buds can be found.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Taste Buds.]\\r\\n\\r\\nMany so-called tastes are really smells. This is easily proved by\\r\\ncompressing the nostrils and attempting to distinguish by taste different\\r\\narticles of food.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe taste sensation is greatest when the exciting substance is at the\\r\\ntemperature of the body. There is no perceptible sweetness to sugar when\\r\\nthe tongue has been dipped for a half-minute in water either at the\\r\\nfreezing temperature or warmed to 50 degrees C. Neither is there any sense\\r\\nof taste until the substance is dissolved by the natural fluids of the\\r\\nmouth, as will be seen by wiping the tongue dry and placing sugar upon it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe four primary taste-sensations are bitter, sweet, sour and salt. These\\r\\nprobably have separate centers and nerve fibers. Sweet and sour tastes are\\r\\nchiefly recognized at the front and bitter and alkaline tastes at the back\\r\\nof the tongue. The same substance will often excite a different sensation,\\r\\naccording as it is placed at the front or back of the tongue.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are also laws of contrast in taste sensations. Certain substances\\r\\nwill enhance the flavor of another and others will destroy it. Again,\\r\\ncertain tastes may disguise others without destroying them, as when an\\r\\nacid is covered with a sweet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nINSANITY. History.--The earliest reference to insanity is found in the\\r\\nbook of Deuteronomy. Another reference is in Samuel where it speaks\\r\\nconcerning David\\'s cunning and successful feigning of insanity. \"And he\\r\\nchanged his behavior before them and feigned himself mad in their hands,\\r\\nand scrabbled on the door-posts of the gate, and let his spittle fall down\\r\\nupon his beard,\" Feigning insanity under distressing circumstances has\\r\\nbeen one of man\\'s achievements throughout the centuries. It is spoken of\\r\\nin Ecclesiastes. Jeremiah says in regard to the  wine cup: \"And they shall\\r\\ndrink and be moved and be mad.\" Nations also were poisoned by the wine\\r\\ncup, for Jeremiah says, \"Babylon has been a golden cup in the Lord\\'s\\r\\nhands, that made all the earth drunken. The nations have drunken of her\\r\\nwine, therefore the nations are mad.\" Greek writers speak of cases of\\r\\nmental unsoundness as occurring with some frequency in Greece. The\\r\\ninhabitants of the Roman Empire were afflicted with mental unsoundness and\\r\\nNero was considered crazy. In ancient Egypt there were temples and priests\\r\\nfor the care of the insane.\\r\\n\\r\\n[NERVOUS DISEASES 309]\\r\\n\\r\\nHippocrates, who lived four hundred years before Christ, was the first\\r\\nphysician who seemed to have any true conception of the real nature of\\r\\ninsanity. For many centuries later the masses believed that madness was\\r\\nsimply a visitation of the devil. The insane, in the time of Christ, were\\r\\npermitted to wander at large among the woods and caves of Palestine. The\\r\\nmonks built the first hospital or asylum for the insane six centuries\\r\\nafter Christ.\\r\\n\\r\\nA hospital for the insane was established at Valencia in Spain in 1409. In\\r\\n1547 the hospital of St. Mary of Bethlehem was established near London and\\r\\nwas known as \"Bedlam\" for a long time.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first asylum to be run upon reform principles was St. Luke\\'s of\\r\\nLondon, founded in 1751. About 1791 Samuel Hahnemann established an asylum\\r\\nfor the insane at Georgenthal, near Gotha, and the law of kindness was the\\r\\nunvarying rule in the institution. Hahnemann says in his Lesser Writings:\\r\\n\"I never allow any insane persons to be punished by blows or other\\r\\ncorporeal inflictions.\" Pineli struck the chains from the incarcerated\\r\\ninsane at the Bicetre, near Paris in 1792 or 1793.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere has been a gradual tendency during the last century toward better\\r\\nthings in the behalf of the insane. A hundred years ago they were treated\\r\\nwith prison surroundings and prison fare. Then asylum treatment began to\\r\\nprevail. This means close confinement, good food, sufficient clothing and\\r\\ncomfortable beds. Asylum care means the humane custody of dangerous\\r\\nprisoners. \"From the asylum we move on to the hospital system of caring\\r\\nfor the insane and this system recognizes the fact that the lunatic is a\\r\\nsick man and needs nursing and medical treatment in order to be cured.\\r\\nHospital treatment has been gradually introduced during the past thirty\\r\\nyears or more,\" and in time it will eventually supercede asylum treatment\\r\\nand prison or workhouse methods in the management of the insane\\r\\neverywhere.\\r\\n\\r\\n[310 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses of Insanity.--There are many and various causes. One author states:\\r\\n\"Mental abnormality is always due to either imperfect or eccentric\\r\\nphysical development, or to the effects of inborn or acquired physical\\r\\ndisease, or to injurious impressions, either ante-natal or post natal,\\r\\nupon the delicate and intricate physical structure known as the human\\r\\nbrain.\" Some physical imperfections, more than others, give rise to mental\\r\\nderangements, and some persons, more than others, when affected by any\\r\\nbodily ailment, tend to aberrated conditions of the mind. Some impressions\\r\\nmore than others, are peculiarly unfortunate by reason of their crowding\\r\\neffects upon the brain tablets of a sensitive mind. To these natural\\r\\ndefects and unnatural tendencies, we apply, in the general way, the term\\r\\n\"Insane Diathesis.\" This diathesis may be inherited or acquired. Those who\\r\\nare born to become insane do not necessarily spring from insane parents or\\r\\nfrom an ancestry having any apparent taint of lunacy in the blood. But\\r\\nthey do receive from their progenitors oftentimes certain impressions upon\\r\\ntheir mental and moral, as well as upon their physical being, which\\r\\nimpressions, like iron molds, fix and shape their subsequent destinies.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe insane diathesis in the child may come from hysteria in the mother. A\\r\\ndrunken father may impel epilepsy, madness or idiocy in the child.\\r\\nUngoverned passions, from love to hate, from hope to fear, when indulged\\r\\nin overmuch by the parents, may unloose the furies of unrestrained madness\\r\\nin the minds of the children. \"The insane may often trace their sad\\r\\nhumiliation and utter unfitness for life\\'s duties back through a tedious\\r\\nline of unrestrained passion, of prejudice, bigotry, and superstition\\r\\nunbridled, of lust unchecked, of intemperance uncontrolled, of avarice\\r\\nunmastered, and of nerve resources wasted, exhausted, and made bankrupt\\r\\nbefore its time. Timely warnings by the physician and appeals to his\\r\\nclients of today, may save them for his own treatment, instead of\\r\\nconsigning them to an asylum where his fees cease from doubling, and the\\r\\ncrazed ones are at rest.\" The causes of the insane diathesis\\r\\n(constitution) are frequently traceable to the methods of life of those\\r\\nwho produce children under such circumstances and conditions that the\\r\\noffspring bear the indelible birthmark of mental weakness. Early\\r\\ndissipations of the father produce an exhausted and enfeebled body; and a\\r\\ndemoralized mind and an unholy and unhealthy existence in the mother, are\\r\\ncauses. Fast living of parents in society is a fruitful cause of mental\\r\\nimperfections in their children. \"The sons of royalty and the sons of the\\r\\nrich, are often weak in brain force because of the high living of their\\r\\nancestry.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fast high livers of today are developing rapidly and surely, strong\\r\\ntendencies to both mental and physical disorders. Elbert Hubbard says of\\r\\nthose who live at a certain hotel and waste their substance there, that\\r\\nthey are apt \"to have gout at one end, general paresis at the other, and\\r\\nBright\\'s disease in the middle.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDrunkenness, lust, rage, fear, mental anxiety or incompatibility, \"if\\r\\nadmitted to participation in the act of impregnation will each, in turn or\\r\\nin combination, often set the seal of their presence in the shape of\\r\\nidiocy, imbecility, eccentricity, or absolute insanity.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDiogenes reproached a half-witted, cracked-brained unfortunate with this\\r\\nremark, \"Surely, young man, thy father begat thee when he was drunk.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n[NERVOUS DISEASES 311]\\r\\n\\r\\nBurton in his anatomy of melancholy states that: \"If a drunken man begets\\r\\na child it will never likely have a good brain,\" Michelet predicts: \"Woe\\r\\nunto the children of darkness, the sons of drunkenness who were, nine\\r\\nmonths before their birth, an outrage on their mothers.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nChildren of drunkards are often \"sad and hideous burlesques upon normal\\r\\nhumanity.\" Business worry may cause unsoundness in the offspring generated\\r\\nunder such conditions.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne father had two sons grow up strong and vigorous, mentally and\\r\\nphysically, while a third son was weak, irresolute, fretful, suspicious\\r\\nand half demented. The father confessed to his physician that on account\\r\\nof business troubles he was half crazy and during this time the wife\\r\\nbecame pregnant and this half-crazy son was born and the father states\\r\\nthat \"he inherits just the state of mind I was then in.\" Many such cases\\r\\ncould be mentioned. \"A sound body and a cheerful mind can only be produced\\r\\nfrom healthy stock.\" Mental peculiarities are produced by unpleasant\\r\\ninfluences brought to bear upon the pregnant mother. The story is told of\\r\\nKing James the Sixth of Scotland, that he was constitutionally timid and\\r\\nshowed great terror at a drawn sword. His father was murdered in his\\r\\nmother\\'s presence while she was pregnant. Children born under the\\r\\ninfluence of fear may be troubled with apprehensions of impending\\r\\ncalamity, so intense that they may become insane at last. An instance is\\r\\ngiven of \"an insane man who always manifested the greatest fear of being\\r\\nkilled and constantly implored those around him not to hurt him.\" His\\r\\nmother lived with her drunken husband who often threatened to kill her\\r\\nwith a knife.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther Causes of Insanity. Imperfect Nutrition.--Whatever tends to weaken\\r\\nthe brain or exhaust the central forces of life must favor the growth of\\r\\ninsanity. The brain is not properly nourished.\\r\\n\\r\\nBlows and Falls upon the Head.--Sometimes such injuries are forgotten, but\\r\\nthey result infrequently in stealthily developed, but none the less\\r\\ndangerous, conditions, which may result in the derangement of all mental\\r\\nfaculties. A child should not be struck on the head. Teachers or parents\\r\\nshould not box a child\\'s ears. One author says such a person \"is guilty of\\r\\nslow murder of innocents.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFright is Another Cause.--Punishing a child by locking it in a dark room\\r\\nor by \"stories of greedy bears or grinning ghosts produces, oftentimes, a\\r\\nmental shock that makes a child wretched in early life, and drives him\\r\\ninto insanity at a later date.\" Overtaxing the undeveloped physical powers\\r\\nis another cause.\\r\\n\\r\\n[312 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nInsanity is most Prevalent among the Working Classes.--Our factories,\\r\\nshops and stores frequently employ the young of both sexes and they are\\r\\novertaxed by day and night and they become feeders of our hospitals for\\r\\nthe insane. Another cause is forced education in the young. Our present\\r\\nschool system tends to break down the body. The work may not be too hard,\\r\\nbut the amount of anxiety and worry, which this work causes in the minds\\r\\nof sensitive children, tends to enfeeble them. Many children are\\r\\nsensitive, with nervous temperaments, and they are easily affected by the\\r\\nstrain of mental toil. Delicate children should be kept in the open air\\r\\nand their physical condition should be considered more than their mental.\\r\\nGirls, especially, at the age of puberty, should be built up instead of\\r\\nrushed through a heavy routine of study. Herbert Spencer says: \"On old and\\r\\nyoung the pressure of modern life puts a still increasing strain. Go where\\r\\nyou will, and before long there comes under your notice cases of children,\\r\\nor youths of either sex, more or less injured by undue study.\" Here, to\\r\\nrecover from a state of debility thus produced, a year\\'s vacation has been\\r\\nfound necessary. There you will find a chronic congestion of the brain\\r\\nthat has already lasted many months and threatens to last much longer. Now\\r\\nyou hear of a fever that has resulted from the over excitement, in some\\r\\nway, brought on at school. And, again, the instance is that of a youth who\\r\\nhas already had to desist from his studies, and who, since he has returned\\r\\nto them is frequently taken out of his class in a fainting fit.\\r\\n\\r\\nSocial pleasure also tends to weaken the system of parents who produce\\r\\nnervous and weakened children. Another great cause of insanity is the\\r\\nunnatural, improper and excessive use of the sexual organs, and diseases\\r\\nthat often come from indiscriminate sexual relations. General paresis is\\r\\nvery often caused by specific disease. I might go on and enlarge upon\\r\\nthese causes, but enough has been written to give warning to those who are\\r\\nbreaking nature\\'s laws.\\r\\n\\r\\nClassification.--There are many classifications. I will mention only the\\r\\nleading names, such as Melancholia, Mania. Dementia, General Paresis.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMELANCHOLIA (Sad Mania).--Melancholia is a disease characterized by great\\r\\nmental depression.\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses--Predisposition, physical disease, dissipation, work and worry,\\r\\nshock, brooding. In simple melancholia the mildest attack may be called\\r\\nthe \"blues.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nACUTE MELANCHOLIA.--Is generally the result of some mental shock.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHRONIC MELANCHOLIA is the end of all other forms of mental depression.\\r\\nAll these have their own peculiar manifestations and need a special line\\r\\nof treatment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMANIA.--This type of insanity means a raving and furious madness. There\\r\\nare many cases of this kind. The causes are many and may be the same as\\r\\nthose which produce melancholia. In melancholia the shock, etc., causes\\r\\ndepression, while in the mania the causes of mental injury tend to produce\\r\\nirritation and excitement. In dementia, the causes of insanity tend to\\r\\nexhaust the body and to mental failure, while in general Paresis \"the\\r\\nshock of disease comes after long and unwise contact with worry, wine and\\r\\nwomen.\" Insufficient sleep often causes mania. It often follows after\\r\\nexhausting and irritating fevers. Long continued ill health, together with\\r\\nworry, etc., may cause it.\\r\\n\\r\\n      NERVOUS DISEASES       313\\r\\n\\r\\nTo sum up, \"mania\" may result from any unusual shock or strain upon the\\r\\nnervous system; or it may come after any unusual mental excitement in\\r\\nbusiness, politics or in religion. Such are the exciting or stimulating\\r\\ncauses, but we must go back of the presence of worldly misfortune and\\r\\ntrace the tendency to mental disorder through channels of hereditary\\r\\ninfluence. \"Infants are born every day whose inevitable goal is that of\\r\\ninsanity.\" What is said in the Bible about sins of the parents is true.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDEMENTIA.--This term literally means \"from mind,\" out of mind, and such a\\r\\nperson is in a state of the most deplorable mental poverty. We all have\\r\\nseen such cases and some cases are not only very sad but disgusting.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPRIMARY DEMENTIA comes on independently of any other form of insanity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSECONDARY DEMENTIA follows after some other form of insanity,--chiefly\\r\\nmelancholia or mania. Dementia may be acute or chronic.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSENILE (OLD AGE) DEMENTIA may be Primary.--Acute dementia attacks both\\r\\nsexes, but it occurs most often in females, though in a milder degree. It\\r\\nis a disease of youth, being rarely seen beyond thirty years of age. It\\r\\nseems to depend often upon exhausting influences operating at a period of\\r\\nrapid growth. Monotony of thought and feeling or want of mental food can\\r\\nalso induce it. Children who are sent at an early age into factories often\\r\\npass into the condition of acute dementia. Prison life also tends to\\r\\nproduce such a condition. Acute diseases such as typhoid and other fevers\\r\\nare sometimes followed by acute dementia. Persons frequently go \"out of\\r\\ntheir mind\" suddenly in this age, and upon recovering from acute dementia,\\r\\nthe patient finds a great \"vacancy of memory.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nChronic Dementia.--Shakespeare says, \"Last scene of all, that ends this\\r\\nstrange, eventful history, is second childishness and mere oblivion; sans\\r\\nteeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The Sans Everything.\"--Is the sad and hopeless obscuration by time or\\r\\ndisease of the once bright, vigorous, scintillating mental powers of\\r\\nexhuperant and lusty youth. Everyone has seen such people who are\\r\\npartially or hopelessly demented. It may come from diseases, such as\\r\\nepilepsy and syphilis; alcohol produces it.\\r\\n\\r\\nSenile dementia is the result of old age and of acquired brain disease. It\\r\\nis different from simple old age or dotage. In old age the mind is\\r\\nweakened, but the patient is conscious of it, such a person forgets a name\\r\\nor date and gropes about in his memory to find it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe demented person is not conscious of loss of memory, but applies wrong\\r\\nnames to persons, and serenely thinks he is right.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe senile demented person does not realize his condition, and if there is\\r\\nany mental power left he cherishes delusions or false beliefs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe victim of old age is unconscious of his weakness.\\r\\n\\r\\n[314 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nGENERAL PARESIS.--Wine, worry and women produce a great many cases of this\\r\\ndisease. The doctors claim a notorious criminal now committed to one\\r\\nasylum and about whom we have read so much, is a victim of this disease.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst stage.--There is worry, anxiety, sleeplessness and melancholy.\\r\\n\\r\\nSecond stage.--Stage of mania, wealth, power, and grandeur, alternating in\\r\\nsome cases with attacks of temporary depressions.\\r\\n\\r\\nThird stage.--Patient passes into a condition of subacute or chronic\\r\\nmania, with a slow tendency to decadence of all the powers, idiotic.\\r\\n\\r\\nFourth stage.--Stage of physical and mental failure and of death. Syphilis\\r\\ncauses most cases. It usually develops between twenty-five and fifty\\r\\nyears. The outlook for such cases is very unfavorable, as the patient\\r\\nusually dies from one to eight or ten years after the beginning of the\\r\\ndisease.\\r\\n\\r\\nTREATMENT.--There have been great advances made in recent years in the\\r\\ntreatment of persons mentally unsound. They should be placed under proper\\r\\ntreatment at an early stage. The causes have been given so that preventive\\r\\nmeasures may be taken.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCONSTITUTIONAL DISEASES.\\r\\n\\r\\nRHEUMATIC GOUT. (Rheumatic Arthritis. Arthritis Deformans).--Cause.--It\\r\\noccurs most often from thirty to fifty-five, usually in women, generally\\r\\nat or after the change of life, and most frequently in those who have not\\r\\nhad children. The involvement of the joints is most common in adult males.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nExciting cause may be: Exposure to cold and wet, improper food, unhygienic\\r\\nsurroundings, worry, blows and acute infections.\\r\\n\\r\\nConditions.--Several joints are usually involved symmetrically. At the\\r\\nedge of the joints there is formation of new bone covered with cartilage,\\r\\ncausing the enlargement of the bone and often partial loss of motion in\\r\\nthat joint.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--Several distinct types exist. 1. General progressive types\\r\\nwhich may be acute or chronic.\\r\\n\\r\\nAcute.--This occurs usually in women from twenty to thirty and at the\\r\\nchange of life. It comes on like acute joint rheumatism, many joints being\\r\\naffected, permanent enlargement appearing early, redness of the joints\\r\\nrarely existing, the pain being very severe, some fever, feel very tired,\\r\\nwith anemia, loss of flesh and strength. The first and later attacks are\\r\\noften associated with pregnancy, confinement or nursing.\\r\\n\\r\\n[CONSTITUTIONAL DISEASES 315]\\r\\n\\r\\nChronic Type.--There is a gradual onset of pain or stiffness in one or\\r\\nmore joints, usually of the fingers, then of the corresponding joints of\\r\\nthe other side and then other joints. The swelling at first may be in the\\r\\nsoft parts of the joints with effusion in the joints and tenderness. The\\r\\npain varies from slight to severe. Periods of improvement and getting\\r\\nworse alternate; the joints becoming enlarged and deformed, often nearly\\r\\nstiff in partial bending on account of the thickened bone and soft\\r\\ntissues. The muscles that move the joint dwindle and there may be changes\\r\\nin the skin and nails of the parts affected due to the want of proper\\r\\nnourishment. Disturbances of the stomach and anemia are common. The heart\\r\\nis not affected. There may be only a few joints affected, or many, with\\r\\ngreat deformity, before the disease reaches the period of inactivity.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Monarticular or one joint type.--This usually occurs in males over\\r\\nfifty; one joint or a few large joints may be affected, generally with\\r\\nshrinking of the corresponding muscles. If it occurs in the hip it is\\r\\ncalled Morbus Coxae Senilis,--Hip joint disease in the aged.\\r\\n\\r\\nRecovery.--The disease usually goes on with intervals of improvement and\\r\\noften results in great crippling and disability. In some cases it becomes\\r\\npermanent.\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral Treatment.--The climate should be warm and dry. The patient should\\r\\navoid exposing himself; lead a general hygienic life, with as nourishing\\r\\nfood as his digestion will permit. The chief line of treatment should be\\r\\nto improve the general health and relieve the pain. The stomach, bowels,\\r\\nand kidneys should be kept working well. Nourishing food should be taken,\\r\\nbut its effect must be watched. Cod-liver oil to build up the system, iron\\r\\nand arsenic may be of value. Sometimes iodide of potash is good. Early and\\r\\nthorough treatment at Hot Springs offers the best hope of arresting its\\r\\nprogress, the Hot Springs in Bath County, Va., and in Arkansas. Much can\\r\\nbe done at home by hot air baths, hot baths, and compresses at night to\\r\\nthe tender joints.\\r\\n\\r\\nLocal.--Massage carefully given is helpful. The hot air treatment is good.\\r\\nBaking the joints is now frequently done.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGOUT (PODAGRA).--A disorder of nutrition characterized by excess of uric\\r\\nacid in the blood, attacks of acute arthritis (inflammation of joints)\\r\\nwith deposit of urate of sodium in and around the joints; with various\\r\\ngeneral symptoms.\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses.--Heredity; male sex, usually appears from thirty to fifty and\\r\\nrarely under twenty; from continued use of alcoholic liquors, especially\\r\\nfermented, with little or no exercise; too much meat. Unhygienic living\\r\\nwith poor food, and excessive drinking of ale and beer may be followed by\\r\\nthe \"poor man\\'s gout.\" It is common in lead workers.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms. Acute Type.--There is often a period of irritability,\\r\\nrestlessness, indigestion, twinges of pain in the hands and feet; the\\r\\nurine is scanty, dark, very acid, with diminished uric acid and deposit\\r\\nwhen it is cooled. The attack sets in usually early in the morning with\\r\\nsudden intense pain in a joint of the big toe, generally the right; less\\r\\noften in an ankle, knee, wrist, hand or finger. The part swells rapidly,\\r\\nand is very tender, the overlying skin being red, glazed and hot. The\\r\\npatient is usually as cross as a wounded bear. The fever may be 103. The\\r\\npain may subside during the day, and increase again at night. There is no\\r\\nsuppuration (pus forming). The symptoms usually decrease, gradually, the\\r\\nentire attack may last from five to eight days. Scaling of the skin over\\r\\nthe sore part may follow. After the attack, the general health may be\\r\\nimproved, and the joint may become normal or but slightly stiff. It recurs\\r\\nat intervals of a few months commonly.\\r\\n\\r\\n[316 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nRetrocedent Gout.--This is a term applied to serious symptoms which\\r\\nsometimes go with rapid improvement of the local joint conditions. There\\r\\nare severe pains in the stomach, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, pain in the\\r\\nheart, difficult breathing, palpitation, irregular and feeble action of\\r\\nthe heart with brain symptoms, probably from uraemia. These attacks often\\r\\ncause death.\\r\\n\\r\\nChronic Gout, Causes, etc.--Frequent acute attacks; many joints, beginning\\r\\nwith the feet, become stiff and deformed, perhaps with no motion. The\\r\\noverlying skin may ulcerate, especially over the knuckles. Dyspepsia,\\r\\narterio-sclerosis, enlargement of the left ventricle of the heart and a\\r\\ngreat quantity of urine with low specific gravity are common. The patient\\r\\nis morose and irritable. Eczema, chronic bronchitis, frequently complicate\\r\\nthe case.\\r\\n\\r\\nDeath often occurs from uraemia, meningitis, pleurisy, pericarditis or\\r\\nperitonitis.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment, Preventive.--Live temperately, abstain from alcohol, eat\\r\\nmoderately, have plenty of fresh air and sunshine, plenty of exercise and\\r\\nregular hours. These do not counteract the inherited tendency. The skin\\r\\nshould be kept active, if the patient is robust, by the morning cold bath\\r\\nwith friction after it; but if he is weak and debilitated, the evening\\r\\nwarm bath should be substituted. The patient should dress warmly, avoid\\r\\nrapid alternations in temperature, and be careful not to have thc skin\\r\\nsuddenly chilled.\\r\\n\\r\\nDiet in Gout.--Most persons over forty eat too much. Eat reasonably and at\\r\\nregular hours and take plenty of time to eat. Do not eat too freely of\\r\\nmeats and avoid too much starchy and sugary foods. Fresh vegetables and\\r\\nfruits may be used freely, except cranberries and bananas.\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Osler of England says.--While all stimulants are injurious to these\\r\\npatients some are more so than others, particularly malted liquors,\\r\\nchampagne, port and a very large proportion of all the light wines. Take\\r\\nlarge quantities of water on an empty stomach, mineral waters are no\\r\\nbetter than others, but treatment of chronic and irregular gout at springs\\r\\ngives the advantage of regular hours, diet, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: A Skiagraph (X-RAY photograph) of the hand.

Campbell, Detroit,\\r\\nMich.]\\r\\n\\r\\n      CONSTITUTIONAL DISEASES       317\\r\\n\\r\\nDiet from a prominent hospital for gout patient:--\\r\\n\\r\\nMay Take--\\r\\n\\r\\nSoups.--Fresh fish soups, vegetable broths clear.\\r\\n\\r\\nFish.--Raw oysters, fresh fish, boiled.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeats.--Fat bacon, boiled or broiled chicken, game (all sparingly).\\r\\n\\r\\nFarinaceous.--Cracked wheat, oatmeal, rice, sago, hominy, whole wheat\\r\\nbread, or biscuits, rye bread, graham bread or rolls, crackers, dry toast,\\r\\nmilk toast, macaroni.\\r\\n\\r\\nVegetables.--Mashed potatoes, green peas, string beans, spinach, cabbage,\\r\\ncucumbers, cresses, lettuce, celery.\\r\\n\\r\\nDesserts.--Plain milk pudding, junket, rice and milk, sago and milk,\\r\\nstewed fruits, all without sugar.\\r\\n\\r\\nDrinks.--Weak tea (no sugar), milk, buttermilk, toast water, pure water,\\r\\ncold or hot.\\r\\n\\r\\nMust Not Take--\\r\\n\\r\\nVeal, pork, goose, duck, turkey, salted, dried, potted or preserved fish\\r\\nor meat (except fat bacon), eels, mackerel, crabs, salmon, lobster, eggs,\\r\\nrich soups, gravies, patties, tomatoes, sweet potatoes, asparagus,\\r\\nmushrooms, rhubarb, lemons, pickles, vinegar, fried or made dishes, rich\\r\\npuddings, spices, pies, pastry, sweets, nuts, dried fruits, tobacco,\\r\\ncoffee, cider, malt liquors, sweet wines, champagne.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--In an acute attack raise the affected limb and wrap the \"sick\"\\r\\njoint in cotton wool; warm fomentations may be used. The wine or tincture\\r\\nof colchicum in doses of twenty to thirty drops may be given every four\\r\\nhours in combination with the citrate of potash, fifteen grains, or the\\r\\ncitrate of lithium five to ten grains. Stop the tincture of colchicum as\\r\\nsoon as the pain is relieved and then you can give wine of colchicum ten\\r\\ndrops every four hours, watching for irritation of the stomach, bowels and\\r\\nkidneys.\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Hare of Philadelphia says.--For hospital practice a very useful\\r\\nmixture is made by adding one part of bicarbonate of sodium to nine parts\\r\\nof linseed oil. The joint is then wrapped in a piece of lint soaked with\\r\\nthis concoction. In some cases oil of peppermint has been recommended. In\\r\\nchronic gout Dr. Hare also gives for diet milk and eggs, the white meat of\\r\\nchicken; fruits, cooked without sugar being added, are allowed. Tea and\\r\\ncoffee being used only in moderation. If any wine is taken it must be\\r\\nfollowed by copious draughts of pure water and the last article should be\\r\\nused ad libitum. On the other hand, pastries and, more than all, sweet\\r\\nwines, are the worst things that such a patient can take, and must be\\r\\nabsolutely prohibited.\\r\\n\\r\\n[318  MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nRHEUMATIC FEVER (Articular Rheumatism).--Causes. This may be acute or\\r\\nchronic. It is an infectious disease characterized by inflammation of\\r\\nseveral joints. The joints are held in place by ligaments and are inclosed\\r\\nby a thin membrane. In this acute rheumatism these parts become congested\\r\\nand inflamed, there is redness and swelling, heat and pain. Fluid is\\r\\npassed into the joint sometimes and then the parts look watery\\r\\n(oeclematous). The inflammation and swelling cause great pain in the\\r\\njoint.\\r\\n\\r\\nPredisposing.--A damp climate, winter and spring, young adults and persons\\r\\nwho are exposed to damp, wet and cold.\\r\\n\\r\\nCondition.--There is congestion of the soft parts of the joints and\\r\\neffusion into the joint cavities of a watery fluid. Endocarditis,\\r\\npericarditis, myocarditis, pleurisy and pneumonia may complicate it. The\\r\\nfirst named, endocarditis, is very common and as the mitral valves become\\r\\ninflamed it is likely to leave valvular trouble unless carefully watched\\r\\nand treated at the time.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--The invasion may be gradual, with a very tired feeling and\\r\\noften tonsilitis; but it is usually sudden, with pains, soreness in one or\\r\\nmore joints and fever. The knees, ankles, elbows and wrists are much\\r\\naffected, but it frequently goes through almost every joint in the body\\r\\nand sometimes repeats the terrible dose. I know, for I had it twice. The\\r\\nsuffering, torture and pain sometimes are simply indescribable and almost\\r\\ntoo hard to bear. The joints become hot, red, painful, swollen and tender\\r\\nto touch and motion. It seems to hurt worse when anyone comes near, for\\r\\nthe patient is afraid of careless handling.\\r\\n\\r\\nFever.--This runs from 102 to 104 and is modified by profuse perspiration\\r\\nwith bad odor and, generally, it does not afford any relief. The urine is\\r\\nvery acid, very thick and looks like thick, strong coffee. The symptoms\\r\\nfrequently disappear partially from one joint or joints as they begin in\\r\\nother joints, attacking several in rapid succession, the fever varying and\\r\\nchanging with the degrees of joint involvement.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe may see the shoulder and hip, the elbow and wrist, knee and ankle,\\r\\netc., all affected at once: Heart complications are frequent and bear\\r\\nclose watching, for they are dangerous to life and the future health of\\r\\nthe patient. The patient becomes very anemic and this progresses rapidly.\\r\\nWhen improvement does begin it is gradual; or the disease may become\\r\\nchronic. Care must be taken not to be too active when improvement sets in\\r\\nor you will cause a return by using the joints before they have become\\r\\nthoroughly well. I did the same thing in my anxiety to get out, but would\\r\\nnever be as reckless again. Pain and stiffness of the joints often last\\r\\nlong after convalescence has set in. One who has had this disease once is\\r\\nliable to another attack if he is not careful.\\r\\n\\r\\n[CONSTITUTIONAL DISEASES 319]\\r\\n\\r\\nMOTHERS\\' REMEDIES. 1. Articular Rheumatism.--A gentleman sends us the\\r\\nfollowing treatment for articular rheumatism and writes as follows: \"I\\r\\nsend you the following treatment for articular rheumatism because I used\\r\\nit myself and was cured in a very short time, in fact, about ten days. It\\r\\nwas a number of years ago in the early spring when my knee joints, ankles\\r\\nand wrists began to pain me and continued to become worse for about a\\r\\nweek, at the end of which time both my knees were perfectly stiff. I sent\\r\\nfor my physician; he wrapped my knees with common baking soda; taking long\\r\\nwide bandages he was enabled to have the baking soda a fourth of an inch\\r\\nthick around the knee, raising the bandage as he laid the soda on; after\\r\\nthis was completed I had heavy wet hot cloths laid around my knee and\\r\\nrenewed every fifteen or twenty minutes for probably eight or ten hours.\\r\\nIn the meantime I was taking the salicylate of soda and the cathartic,\\r\\nveronica water, as directed below. The following day I sat up with my legs\\r\\nresting on a chair, straightened out, and hot flat irons at my knees. I\\r\\nbegan this treatment on Saturday, and the following Thursday was able to\\r\\nwalk about and go out of town, and never had rheumatism since, but at two\\r\\nor three different times I suspected it was coming on and used the\\r\\nsalicylate of soda and veronica water as a successful preventive; at least\\r\\nthe rheumatism did not materialize.\\r\\n\\r\\nVeronica Water.--Dose:--Glassful every two and one-half hours till bowels\\r\\nare free, then one dose a day.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso\\r\\n      Salicylate of Soda       1 ounce\\r\\n      Water                    6 ounces\\r\\n\\r\\nLarge teaspoonful every two hours with a quinine pill every other dose.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Rheumatism, Cotton Excellent for Inflammatory.--\"Take a roll of cotton\\r\\nbatting and wrap the limb, or part of the body affected, as firmly and\\r\\ntightly as possible, without tearing the cotton, let it remain\\r\\n\"twenty-four hours, then tighten it up by unwinding and rewrapping the\\r\\ncotton as tight as possible, as on the first application, and so continue\\r\\nevery twenty-four hours until cured, which, in my case, was three days. I\\r\\nhad been troubled with rheumatism for a long time, and was unable to walk.\\r\\nI tried everything, doctors and all, but nothing helped me. A lady from\\r\\nCincinnati, who was visiting at a neighbor\\'s, called at my house one day\\r\\nand learning what was the matter with me, advised me to put cotton on as\\r\\nstated above. I had no faith in it, but I had tried everything else and\\r\\nconcluded I would try that, with the result that it cured me. Possibly if\\r\\na case should require a longer time for a cure than mine it might be\\r\\nnecessary, or be better, to replace the cotton with a fresh roll. The\\r\\nrewrapping every twenty-four hours is intended to keep the cotton batting\\r\\nfirmly and tightly around the part affected as the swelling recedes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n[320 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nPrevention.--Wear flannel late and early. Keep from taking cold. Put off\\r\\nwet things of every kind immediately upon getting home and dry your body\\r\\nand put on dry well-aired clothes. Never sleep in a damp bed, under damp\\r\\nunaired clothes. When you go away from home do not sleep in a room or bed\\r\\nthat has been unoccupied for any length of time, especially if there is no\\r\\nfurnace in the house. Do not sit down in wet damp clothes, stockings,\\r\\nshoes, etc. Do not sit down anywhere to \"cool off.\" It is inviting trouble\\r\\nand sickness. Do not lie on the damp ground, do not sleep on the first\\r\\nfloor of an old damp house. Have plenty of sunlight and air in your\\r\\nsleeping room. These directions apply to the chronic cases also. It does\\r\\nnot matter so much if one is wet or sweating as long as he keeps moving or\\r\\nworking. On wash day do not dry your clothes in the kitchen or sitting\\r\\nroom, or put them on your bed, unless they have been thoroughly dried,\\r\\naired and warmed before using. These little things mean much in real life.\\r\\n\\r\\nPHYSICIANS\\' CAUTION for Articular Rheumatism.--Go to bed and remain there\\r\\nand do not get up too soon, for remember the parts are still tender when\\r\\nthey may not be painful.\\r\\n\\r\\nLocal Treatment.--1. There must be absolute rest. Remove the sheets from\\r\\nthe bed and wrap woolen cloths or blankets about the patient and protect\\r\\nthe inflamed joints from the weight of the coverings. Cover the joints\\r\\nwith gauze or absorbent cotton, after putting on the parts a thick coating\\r\\nof ichthyol ointment.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Sometimes hot fomentations are helpful in relieving the suffering;\\r\\nsometimes cold cloths are best.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. The following is good. Apply with cloths wrung out of it:\\r\\n\\r\\n    Carbonate of Soda    6 drams\\r\\n    Tincture Arnica     10 ounces\\r\\n    Glycerin             2 ounces\\r\\n    Water                9 ounces\\r\\n\\r\\n4.  Oil of Wintergreen       1 ounce\\r\\n    Compound Soap Liniment   8 ounces\\r\\n\\r\\nMix.\\r\\n\\r\\nRub the affected parts with oil of wintergreen and then wrap the parts in\\r\\ncotton wool and soak with the solution.\\r\\n\\r\\n5. \"A layer or two of gauze saturated with methyl-salicylate is wrapped\\r\\naround the painful joints and covered with paraffin paper, or other\\r\\nimpervious dressing, held in place by a bandage. This is renewed once or\\r\\ntwice daily until the pain in all the joints is relieved.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n6. Internal.--Sodium salicylate or aspirin given until the pain and\\r\\ntemperature are relieved; usually five to ten grains of sodium salicylate\\r\\nevery three hours for an adult; or five grains of the aspirin every three\\r\\nhours.\\r\\n\\r\\n7. Dr. Hare recommends for the beginning in a strong, healthy individual,\\r\\nten drops of the tincture of aconite at once in a little water, and follow\\r\\nit by a teaspoonful of a mixture containing fifteen drops of tincture of\\r\\naconite and two ounces of water everyone-half hour, until perspiration on\\r\\nthe skin betokens the circulatory depression through the action of the\\r\\ndrug. I use aconite in this disease very often, but not in such doses as\\r\\nthe first one. It seems to me that it is uselessly large. I use about\\r\\none-tenth of a drop at a dose everyone to two hours during the first\\r\\ntwenty-four hours.\\r\\n\\r\\n[CONSTITUTIONAL DISEASES 321]\\r\\n\\r\\nNursing.--The nurse must have the patience of Job to attend a patient sick\\r\\nwith this disease; but you must remember the suffering is awful. The\\r\\npatient may be very restless and the pillows may need rearranging every\\r\\nfew minutes. Also be careful how you handle the patient. It hurts terribly\\r\\nto be even touched. A rough, hearty person has no business to care for\\r\\nsuch a patient. I allow patients to say anything they wish, for this is a\\r\\npainful disease. They may swear at me if they wish. I know how it is, for\\r\\nI was there twice, the last time for six long weeks. Have patience and\\r\\ncourage and cheer your patient. Do not look cross or scold.\\r\\n\\r\\nDiet.--Milk mainly, broths, gruels, albumen water, oyster or clam broth,\\r\\nmilk toast, buttermilk, kumiss. Do not give solid food. Water, lemonade,\\r\\nvichy or carbonated water.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHRONIC RHEUMATISM.--Causes.--Heredity may predispose to it. It is most\\r\\ncommon in those who are exposed to hard labor in the cold and wet;\\r\\nespecially in women about middle age. It occasionally follows sub-acute,\\r\\nbut rarely acute rheumatism.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--Many large joints are usually affected; sometimes it may be\\r\\nonly one joint; at times, the small joints only are affected. It may be\\r\\nonly on the one side. It usually persists in the joints involved, but may\\r\\nattack others. The chief symptoms are stiffness of the joints, especially\\r\\nafter a rest and this diminishes after some motion, also pain, which grows\\r\\nworse in damp weather. The joints may be tender to the touch, slightly\\r\\nswollen, rarely red. They may in time become entirely stiff and deformed.\\r\\nThe general health may be good or there may be anemia, dyspepsia and\\r\\nvalvular disease due to sclerosis,--hardening of the valves of the heart.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrognosis.--This is good as to life, but the disease is often progressive.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment. Preventive.--A warm, dry, unchangeable climate, good\\r\\nsurroundings, good food; keep the stomach and bowels and kidneys in good\\r\\ncondition, avoid taking cold. Do not sit down in a draft to \"cool off.\" Do\\r\\nnot go into a cool room in summer when you are warm or sweated. Do not\\r\\nsleep in a bed that has not been used for months and kept for \"company.\"\\r\\nDo not dry your clothes in the kitchen and in that way make the whole\\r\\nhouse steamy and damp. Do not sleep under unaired damp covers or in a damp\\r\\nnight dress. Always air and dry your bedding and night dress before using.\\r\\nDo not take a hot bath and go into a cool room to cool off, but wrap\\r\\nyourself up so as to be warm and cool off gradually. Any additional cold\\r\\nwill cause more rheumatism.\\r\\n\\r\\n[322 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nSleeping rooms on the first floor are an abomination for rheumatic\\r\\npersons. Do not sit down in wet clothes, stockings or shoes. Take them off\\r\\nimmediately on getting home, wipe yourself dry and put on dry garments.\\r\\nCare in such little seemingly foolish things will do wonderful things for\\r\\na rheumatic person. I had two rheumatic attacks in my first year of\\r\\npractice. Since then I have learned caution and through a hard and busy\\r\\nlife I have kept myself reasonably well by looking after such little aids\\r\\nand cautions as, the above. I never sit down for any length of time in\\r\\ndamp or wet clothes, and if I can do that, persons that are not driven\\r\\nlike doctors can do the same. These cautions apply to not only this kind\\r\\nof rheumatism, but to all kinds of rheumatism, neuralgias, and to\\r\\ninflammatory diseases, such as neuritis, tonsilitis, pneumonia, pleurisy,\\r\\netc. Hot air baths, Hot Springs, massage will be more effectual in this\\r\\ndisease than in the former. Iodide of potash also is very useful. Flannel\\r\\nunderwear, heavy and light weight, is very beneficial in rheumatism. Great\\r\\nbenefit can be derived at home by wrapping the affected joints in cold\\r\\ncloths, covering with a thin layer of flannel and protected by oiled silk.\\r\\nA great many cases are helped by using hot fomentations of hops, wormwood,\\r\\nsmartweed, etc. Turpentine applied locally to the joints is effective, but\\r\\nit is very likely to injure the kidneys when used freely and in these days\\r\\nwhen there are so many diseases of the kidneys one must be careful or they\\r\\nwill produce an incurable and serious disease in the place of one that is\\r\\npainful, but not necessarily dangerous. Many of the simple remedies have a\\r\\ngood effect on the rheumatic troubles.\\r\\n\\r\\nPHYSICIANS\\' TREATMENT for Rheumatism.--Dr. Hare gives the following to\\r\\nrub on large joints:\\r\\n\\r\\n1.   Ichthyol   1/2 to 1 ounce\\r\\n     Lard       1 ounce\\r\\n\\r\\n2.   Tincture of Aconite        6 drams\\r\\n     Tincture Arnica            1 ounce\\r\\n     Oil of Turpentine          l ounce (l or 2)\\r\\n     Soap Liniment enough for   8 ounces\\r\\n\\r\\nUse as a liniment three times a day. This can be used for some weeks.\\r\\n\\r\\n3.   Strong Water of Ammonia           6 drams\\r\\n     Oil of Cajeput                    1 dram\\r\\n     Tincture of Belladonna       1 to 2 ounces\\r\\n     Camphor Liniment enough for       8 ounces\\r\\n\\r\\nUse as a liniment.\\r\\n\\r\\n4.   Tincture of Aconite     1 ounce\\r\\n     Tincture Belladonna     2 drams\\r\\n     Strong Ammonia Water    4 drams\\r\\n     Chloroform Liniment     6 drams\\r\\n\\r\\nUsed as a liniment on chronic or inflamed muscles or joints.\\r\\n\\r\\n5.   Iodide of Potash                 1/2 ounce\\r\\n     Compound Syrup of Sarsaparilla     3 ounces\\r\\n     Distilled Water                    3 ounces\\r\\n\\r\\nMix and take a dessertspoonful in a glass of water two hours after meals\\r\\nfor chronic rheumatism.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Muscular System.]\\r\\n\\r\\n[CONSTITUTIONAL DISEASES 323]\\r\\n\\r\\n6. This is prepared by Parke, Davis & Co., and made into a syrup:\\r\\n\\r\\n    Red Clover         32 grains\\r\\n    Queen\\'s Root       16 grains\\r\\n    Barberry           10 grains\\r\\n    Prickly Ash Bark    4 grains\\r\\n    Burdock Root       16 grains\\r\\n    Poke Root          16 grains\\r\\n    Honduras Bark      16 grains\\r\\n    Iodide of Potash    8 grains\\r\\n\\r\\nThis portion to each fluid ounce of the syrup.\\r\\n\\r\\n7. The following is good:\\r\\n\\r\\nEqual parts of each of the following:\\r\\n    Blue Cohosh Root\\r\\n    Black Cohosh Root\\r\\n    Poke Root\\r\\n    Yellow Dock Root\\r\\n    Blue Flag Root\\r\\n    Prickly Ash Root\\r\\n    Burdock Root\\r\\n    Dandelion Root\\r\\n\\r\\nBruise them thoroughly or grind them coarsely, steep and make a tea and\\r\\ndrink freely of it. If you wish you can take three to five grains of\\r\\nIodide of Potash to each dose. This may in time disorder the stomach and\\r\\nyou may then stop it for a time. All these can be used in muscular\\r\\nrheumatism also. The food should not be rich or highly seasoned. Spices\\r\\nare bad for such patients. Pickles, mustard, etc., are best let alone.\\r\\n\\r\\nMUSCULAR RHEUMATISM.--This is a very painful affection of the voluntary\\r\\nmuscles, called also neuralgia, or according to its location, torticollis\\r\\n(stiff neck, wry neck), pleurodynia, lumbago (rheumatism in the back).\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses.--Predisposed to it by previous attacks, having a rheumatic or\\r\\ngouty constitution (diathesis). It follows sudden exposure, hence it is\\r\\nmost common in men.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--Local pain in the muscles, sharp or dull, aching constant, or\\r\\ncaused by certain movements and is usually relieved by pressure. It lasts\\r\\nfrom a few days to several weeks and frequently recurs. The common forms\\r\\nare: Lumbago. This affects the muscles of the back, and usually comes on\\r\\nsuddenly with a sharp stich-like pain, and is chiefly seen in those who\\r\\nlabor hard, often completely disabling them for a time.\\r\\n\\r\\nTorticollis (stiff or wry neck).--It is usually on the side or back of the\\r\\nneck. Comes from a draught of cold wind on the neck, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nPleurodynia, pain in the chest muscles, etc.--With pain in all movements\\r\\nof the chest, resembling intercostal neuralgia or pleurisy.\\r\\n\\r\\n[324 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nDiet for Rheumatism from the Head Nurse of a Prominent Hospital:--\\r\\n\\r\\nMay Take--\\r\\n\\r\\nSoups.--Mutton broth, chicken or beef tea, in small quantities.\\r\\n\\r\\nFish.--Raw clams or oysters, fresh fish (whiter kinds) boiled.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeats.--Chicken, calf \\'s head, sweetbread, tripe, broiled fat bacon or\\r\\nbroiled ham (all sparingly).\\r\\n\\r\\nFarinaceous.--Whole wheat, corn or brown bread, arrowroot, rice, dry\\r\\ntoast, milk toast.\\r\\n\\r\\nVegetables.--Spinach, green peas or cabbage (well boiled), celery,\\r\\nlettuce, cresses, radishes.\\r\\n\\r\\nDesserts.--Milk, rice or arrowroot pudding, (all without sugar), junket.\\r\\n\\r\\nDrinks--Tea (without sugar), buttermilk, pure water, plain with lemon or\\r\\nlime juice (no sugar).\\r\\n\\r\\nMust Not Take--\\r\\n\\r\\nPork, veal, turkey, goose, duck, fried fish or salt meats, cooked oysters\\r\\nor clams, salted, dried, potted or preserved fish or meats (except fat\\r\\nbacon or ham), crabs, salmon, lobster, eggs, rich made dishes, gravies,\\r\\npotatoes, tomatoes, beans, asparagus, mushrooms, candies, rich puddings,\\r\\npies, pastry, nuts, cheese, coffee, cider, malt liquors, wines.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment for Stiff Neck.--Wry Neck, (torticollis).--Warmth applied either\\r\\ndry or moist as hot salt bag or fomentations of hops, etc. Parke, Davis &\\r\\nCo., Detroit, now make a preparation called capsicine. This is very good\\r\\nfor this trouble, rubbed on thoroughly as directed. It can be bought at\\r\\nmost drug stores. It is also good for headaches and neuralgias. The same\\r\\nline of treatment, hot and cold applications, can be given for pain in the\\r\\nchest muscles (pleurodynia) and lumbago.\\r\\n\\r\\nA MOTHERS\\' REMEDY for Stiff Neck.--Hot Salt and Oil of Sassafras.--\"If\\r\\ntroubled with stiff neck, fill a bag with hot salt and sleep on it, or rub\\r\\nthe neck with oil of sassafras which, by the way, is also excellent for\\r\\nlumbago and to scatter, not cure, rheumatism pains.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPHYSICIANS\\' TREATMENT for Rheumatism.--Preventive.--Avoid exposure as\\r\\nstated for other rheumatism. Rest the chest by strapping with adhesive\\r\\nplaster as in pleurisy. Porous plasters are good and liniments; sometimes\\r\\nhelp is obtained by rubbing freely with camphor. Hot dry or wet\\r\\napplications are frequently useful. Mustard plaster is very good when the\\r\\nspace is not too great. Mix the mustard with the white of an egg and after\\r\\nit is taken off grease the part and keep on warm cloths. Hot foot baths\\r\\nand hot drinks of lemonade or teas, after which the person should go to\\r\\nbed and sweat and remain there for some hours.\\r\\n\\r\\n[CONSTITUTIONAL DISEASES 325]\\r\\n\\r\\nLiniment.--\\r\\n\\r\\n    Oil of Wintergreen       1/2 to 1 ounce\\r\\n    Compound Soap Liniment          8 ounces\\r\\n\\r\\nMix and rub on thoroughly.\\r\\n\\r\\nMOTHERS\\' REMEDIES.--Lumbago, Menthol Liniment for.--Apply the menthol\\r\\nliniment, cover with a thick cloth and put the hot water bottle next to it\\r\\nand go to bed.

Men are more\\r\\nfrequently affected than women, the ratio being about three to two.\\r\\nPersons of a nervous temperament are often affected. It is a disease of\\r\\nthe higher classes. Hebrews seem especially prone to it. The disease is\\r\\ncomparatively rare in the colored race; women more than men in the negro,-\\r\\nnine to six. In a considerable proportion of the cases of diabetes the\\r\\npatients have been very fat at the beginning of or prior to the onset of\\r\\nthe disease. It is more common in cities than in country districts. The\\r\\ncombination of intense application to business, over-indulgence in food\\r\\nand drink, with a sedentary life, seem particularly prone to induce the\\r\\ndisease. Injury to or disease of the spinal cord or brain has been\\r\\nfollowed by diabetes. It is much more frequent in European countries than\\r\\nhere. Acute and chronic forms are recognized in the former.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--The only difference is that the patients are younger in acute\\r\\nforms, the course is more rapid and the wasting away is more marked. The\\r\\nonset of the disease is gradual and either frequent passing of urine (six\\r\\nto forty pints in twenty-four hours) or inordinate thirst attracts\\r\\nattention. When it is fully established, there is great thirst, the\\r\\npassage of large quantities of sugar urine, a terrible appetite, and, as a\\r\\nrule, progressive emaciation. The thirst is one of the most distressing\\r\\nsymptoms. Large quantities of water are required to keep the sugar in\\r\\nsolution and for its excretion in the urine. Some cases do not have the\\r\\nexcessive thirst; but in such case the amount of urine passed is never\\r\\nlarge. The thirst is most intense an hour or two after meals. The\\r\\ndigestion is generally good, but the appetite is inordinate. Pain in the\\r\\nback is common. The tongue is usually dry, red and glazed, and the saliva\\r\\nis scanty. The gums may become swollen. Constipation is the rule. The skin\\r\\nis dry and harsh and sweating rarely occurs. The temperature is under\\r\\nnormal. In spite of the enormous amount of food eaten a patient may become\\r\\nrapidly emaciated. Patients past middle life may have the disease for\\r\\nyears without much disturbance of the health; on the other hand I have\\r\\nseen them die after that age. Progress is more rapid the younger the\\r\\nperson. Death usually occurs from coma of diabetes. This is most common in\\r\\nyoung patients.\\r\\n\\r\\n[CONSTITUTIONAL DISEASES 329]\\r\\n\\r\\n1. There is a sudden onset after exertion of weakness, feeble pulse,\\r\\nstupor, coma, death in a few hours.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Sudden headache, coma, death in a few hours.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. After nausea, vomiting or a lung complication, there are headache,\\r\\ndelirium, abdominal pain, rapid labored breathing, sweetish odor of the\\r\\nbreath, stupor, rapid feeble pulse, coma and death within a few days.\\r\\n\\r\\nRecovery.--Instances of cure in true diabetes are rare.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment. Preventive.--The use of starchy and sugary articles of diet\\r\\nshould be restricted in families with a marked disposition to this\\r\\ndisease. Sources of worry should be avoided and he should lead an even\\r\\nquiet life, if possible, in an equable climate. Flannel and silk should be\\r\\nworn next to the skin, and the greatest care should be taken to promote\\r\\nits action. A lukewarm and, if tolerably robust, a cold bath should be\\r\\ntaken every day. An occasional Turkish bath is useful.\\r\\n\\r\\nDiet.--Let the patients eat food of easy digestion, such as veal, mutton\\r\\nand the like, and abstain from all sorts of fruit and garden stuff. In\\r\\nJohns Hopkins\\' Hospital these patients are kept for three or four days on\\r\\nthe ordinary ward diet, which contains a moderate amount of\\r\\ncarbo-hydrates, in order to ascertain the amount of sugar excretions. For\\r\\ntwo days more the starches are gradually cut off. They are then placed on\\r\\nthe following standard non-carbohydrate diet.\\r\\n\\r\\nBreakfast: 7:30, six ounces of tea or coffee; four ounces of beefsteak,\\r\\nmutton chops without bone, or boiled ham; one or two eggs.\\r\\n\\r\\nLunch: 12:30, six ounces of cold roast beef; two ounces celery, fresh\\r\\ncucumbers or tomatoes with vinegar, olives, pepper and salt to taste, five\\r\\ndrams of whisky with thirteen ounces of water, two ounces of coffee\\r\\nwithout milk or sugar.\\r\\n\\r\\nDinner: 6:00 P. M., six ounces of clear bouillon; seven and a half ounces\\r\\nof roast beef; one and one-half drams of butter; two ounces of green salad\\r\\nwith two and a half drams of vinegar, five drams of olive oil, or three\\r\\ntablespoonfuls of some well-cooked green vegetable: three sardines; five\\r\\ndrams of whisky with thirteen ounces of water.\\r\\n\\r\\nSupper: 9:00 P. M., two eggs, raw or cooked, thirteen ounces of water .\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following is a list of articles which a diabetes patient may take as\\r\\ngiven by one of the best authorities in the world on diabetes:\\r\\n\\r\\nLiquids: Soups.--Ox tail, turtle bouillon and other clear soups. Lemonade,\\r\\ncoffee, tea, chocolate and cocoa; these to be taken without sugar, but\\r\\nthey may be sweetened with saccharin. Potash or soda water and\\r\\nappollinaris, or the Saratoga-vichy and milk in moderation may be used.\\r\\n\\r\\n[330 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnimal Food.--Fish of all sorts, including crabs, oysters, salt and fresh\\r\\nbutcher\\'s meat (with the exception of liver), poultry and game, eggs,\\r\\nbuttermilk, curds and cream cheese.\\r\\n\\r\\nBread.--Gluten and bran bread, almond and cocoanut biscuits.\\r\\n\\r\\nVegetables.--Lettuce, tomatoes, spinach, chickory, sorrel, radishes,\\r\\nasparagus, water-cress, mustard and cress, cucumber, celery and endives;\\r\\npickles of various sorts.\\r\\n\\r\\nFruits.--Lemons and oranges, currants, plums, cherries, pears, apples\\r\\n(tart), melons, raspberries and strawberries may be taken in moderation.\\r\\nNuts, as a rule, allowable.\\r\\n\\r\\nMust Not Take--\\r\\n\\r\\nThick Soups and Liver. Ordinary bread of all sorts (in quantity), rye,\\r\\nwheaten, brown or white. All farinaceous (starchy) preparations, such as\\r\\nhominy, rice, tapioca, arrowroot, sago and vermicelli.\\r\\n\\r\\nVegetables: Potatoes, turnips, parsnips, squashes, vegetable-marrows of\\r\\nall kinds, beets, common artichokes.\\r\\n\\r\\nLiquids: Beer, sparkling wine of all sorts and the sweet aerated drinks.\\r\\n\\r\\nMedicines. Codeine.--A patient may begin with one-half grain three times a\\r\\nday, which may be gradually increased to six or eight grains in the\\r\\ntwenty-four hours (under the doctor\\'s care); withdraw it gradually when\\r\\nsugar is absent or reduced as far as possible.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDIABETES INSIPIDUS.--A chronic affection characterized by the passage of\\r\\nlarge quantities of normal urine of low specific gravity.\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses.--It is most often found in young males and is probably of nervous\\r\\norigin. It may follow excitement or brain injury.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--The onset is usually gradual. The urine is pale; ten to twenty\\r\\nquarts a day. Thirst, dryness of the mouth and skin. Appetite and general\\r\\nconditions are usually normal; sometimes there are feebleness and\\r\\nemaciation. Death usually occurs from some other disease.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--There is no known cure. Keep the general health in good\\r\\ncondition according to the advice of your family physician.\\r\\n\\r\\nOBESITY.--An excessive development of fat; it may be hereditary. It occurs\\r\\nmost frequently in women of middle age and in children. Its chief cause is\\r\\nexcessive eating and drinking, especially of the starch and sugar foods\\r\\nand malt liquors, and lack of exercise. The increase of fat is in all the\\r\\nnormal situations and the heart and liver are often large and fatty. The\\r\\ncondition in general may be good or there may be inactivity of the mind\\r\\nand body. Disturbances of digestion and symptoms of a fatty heart. There\\r\\nis less power to resist disease. Death may occur from fatty infiltration\\r\\nof the heart, resulting in dilatation or rupture.\\r\\n\\r\\n[CONSTITUTIONAL DISEASES 331]\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--Must be in regulating the diet. The person must avoid all\\r\\nexcess in food and drink, and avoid especially foods that contain starch\\r\\nand sugar. There must be regular and systematic exercise, hot baths and\\r\\nmassages are helps. Medicines made from the poke berry are much used and\\r\\nare successful in some cases.\\r\\n\\r\\nDiet.--The food of a fleshy person should be cut down gradually. Its bulk\\r\\ncan be great, but its nourishing properties should be small. The diet for\\r\\nreduction of obesity should consist chiefly of bulky vegetables, but not\\r\\ntoo much of any one article or set of articles. The following list is\\r\\nrecommended by Dr. Hare of Philadelphia:\\r\\n\\r\\nFor Breakfast.--One or two cups of coffee or tea, without milk or sugar,\\r\\nbut sweetened with a fraction of a grain of saccharin. Three ounces of\\r\\ntoasted or ordinary white bread or six ounces of brown bread; enough\\r\\nbutter may be used to make the bread palatable, not more than one ounce.\\r\\nSliced raw tomatoes with vinegar, or cooked tomatoes without any sugar or\\r\\nfats. This diet may be varied by the use of salted or fresh fish, either\\r\\nat breakfast or dinner. This fish must not be rich like salmon or\\r\\nsword-fish, but rather like perch or other small fish.\\r\\n\\r\\nNoon Meal--Dinner.--One soup plate of bouillon, consomme julienne, or\\r\\nother thin soup, or Mosqueras beef-jelly, followed by one piece of the\\r\\nwhite meat of any form of fowl or a small bird. Sometimes a small piece,\\r\\nthe size of one\\'s hand, of rare beef, or mutton but no fat, may be\\r\\nallowed, and this should be accompanied by string beans, celery (stewed or\\r\\nraw), spinach, kale, cabbage, beans, asparagus, beets and young onions.\\r\\nFollowing this, lettuce with vinegar and a little olive oil (to make a\\r\\nFrench dressing), a cup of black coffee or one of tea, and a little acid\\r\\nfruit, such as sour grapes, tamarinds and sour oranges, or lemons may be\\r\\ntaken, and followed by a cigar, if the patient has such a habit.\\r\\n\\r\\nSupper.--This should consist of one or two soft boiled eggs, which may be\\r\\npoached, but not fried, a few ounces of brown bread, some salad and fruit\\r\\nand perhaps a glass or two of light, dry (not sweet) wine, if the patient\\r\\nis accustomed to its use.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore Going to Bed.--To avoid discomfort from a sensation of hunger\\r\\nduring the night, the patient may take a meal of panada, or he may soak\\r\\ngraham or bran crackers or biscuits in water and flavor the mess with salt\\r\\nand pepper. The reduction of the diet is generally best accomplished\\r\\nslowly and should be accompanied by measures devoted to the utilization of\\r\\nthe fat present for the support of the body. Thus, the patient should not\\r\\nbe too heavily clad, either day or night, should resort to exercise, daily\\r\\nbecoming more severe, and should not drink freely of water, unless\\r\\nsweating is established sufficiently to prevent the accumulation of liquid\\r\\nin vessels and tissues. Baths of the proper kind, cold or Turkish, should\\r\\nbe used, if the patient stands them well. The bowels should be kept active\\r\\nby laxative fruit or purges. Salts are useful if drinks are thrown off\\r\\nrapidly. If proper exercise is impossible the rest cure with massage,\\r\\nelectricity, passive exertion and absolute skimmed milk diet may be\\r\\nresorted to, particularly in those persons known as \"fat anemics,\" who\\r\\nhave not enough red corpuscles in their blood to carry sufficient oxygen\\r\\nto the tissues to complete oxidation.\\r\\n\\r\\n[332 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCANCER.--(In the following article on cancer we quote in part from\\r\\nmaterial issued by the Public Health Department of the State of Michigan).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCancer is curable if it be operated upon in its early stages.--If it be\\r\\nleft to grow and develop, cancer is always fatal. It may be partially\\r\\nremoved when in an advanced stage, and relief may be had for some time\\r\\nafter operation; but beyond the early stage, cancer cannot at present be\\r\\npermanently removed, nor permanently cured. Permanent cure of a cancer is\\r\\npossible if the afflicted person obtains an early diagnosis and receives\\r\\nearly attention from a skilled surgeon. The only permanent cure for cancer\\r\\nknown at the present time is early surgical operation.\\r\\n\\r\\nHave Operations Failed to Cure?--Very few persons die from operations\\r\\nperformed by skilled surgeons for the removal of cancer. Where cancer\\r\\noperation is done by experienced surgeons the fatality in America for the\\r\\npast fourteen years is less than one case out of a hundred, or in other\\r\\nwords ninety-nine persons out of a hundred survive operation for cancer.\\r\\nMany persons have died from the return of the cancerous growth even after\\r\\noperation by a skilled surgeon, and this fact has led many persons to\\r\\nbelieve that operation for cancer is, therefore, unsuccessful, that it\\r\\ndoes not cure. This is not the fact. It is true that cancer often returns\\r\\nafter operation, and that this method does not always effect a permanent\\r\\ncure; but it is not true that operations are, therefore, useless. The\\r\\nreason that operations do not remove cancers permanently in a great number\\r\\nof cases is that such cases do not submit to operation soon enough. The\\r\\nmajority of persons suffering from cancer seek surgical aid too late. If a\\r\\nhouse is on fire and one refuses to turn in an alarm until the fire has\\r\\nspread from cellar to garret, neither blame nor disparagement must be\\r\\nplaced upon the fire department if it failed to save the burning house. So\\r\\nwith cancer; if the public refuses or neglects to operate for cancer at\\r\\nthe time when it can be eradicated, the public cannot censure or belittle\\r\\nsurgery. A cancer is like a green and ripe thistle. Pull up the green\\r\\nthistle and you have gotten rid of it. But if you wait until the thistle\\r\\nis ripe, and the winds have blown away the seeds, there is no use of\\r\\npulling up that thistle. Early operations are successful. Late ones are\\r\\nnot.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo reliable surgeon claims to save his patient or cure him of cancer if\\r\\nthe disease be in an advanced stage. But experienced surgeons do recognize\\r\\nthe fact that cancer in its early stage can be permanently removed and a\\r\\npermanent cure can be effected by surgical operation. No other means of\\r\\npermanent cure are known.\\r\\n\\r\\n[CONSTITUTIONAL DISEASES 333]\\r\\n\\r\\nCaustic pastes applied to cancerous growths or sera, are sometimes\\r\\nsuccessful in obliterating the cancer for a time; but they are not\\r\\nreliable for effecting enduring cures, and usually are merely palliative,\\r\\nThe fact that a cancer does not return for three years after removal is\\r\\nnot sure proof that it will not return; the return of a cancerous growth\\r\\ndepends upon its state of development and other conditions at the time of\\r\\nremoval from the cancer. In Johns Hopkins\\' Hospital forty-seven per cent\\r\\nof all patients with cancers of the breast operated upon remained well for\\r\\nthree years or more, and seventy-five per cent of this forty-seven per\\r\\ncent were cured, being in the most favorable condition for cure at the\\r\\ntime of the operation. But where conditions are not favorable at the time\\r\\nof the operation, many patients have a return of the cancer even after the\\r\\nthree years of apparent cure have elapsed.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat is Cancer?--A cancer is a growth of cancerous cells in a network of\\r\\nconnective tissue. The cause of cancer is not known. It has not been\\r\\nproved to be communicable and the majority of investigators of this\\r\\nsubject believe that it is not caused by a germ. Nor is it thought to be\\r\\ninherited. Out of 8,000 cases of cancer at Middlesex Hospital, London, no\\r\\nevidence of heredity was found. Until the cause of cancer is known, it\\r\\ncannot be prevented. The only safeguard lies in an early diagnosis of the\\r\\ncondition and an immediate operation. Eminent investigators are carrying\\r\\non extensive research and thousands of dollars are being spent annually to\\r\\nascertain, if possible, what is the cause of this dread disease, and it is\\r\\nconfidently believed that final success will crown this labor.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen to Suspect Cancer and What to Do.--External or Exposed\\r\\nCancer.--Cancer of the exposed or surface parts of the body, such as the\\r\\nskin of the lip, nose, cheek, forehead, temples, etc., is more readily\\r\\nrecognized than internal cancer, and is therefore more liable to early\\r\\noperation and prompt cure. One rarely sees these forms of cancer in an\\r\\nadvanced stage, because such cases are readily seen and recognized by\\r\\nphysicians in the early stage of development, when operation can be\\r\\nsufficiently early to effect a lasting cure.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe least malignant of all cancers is that kind which first exhibits\\r\\nitself by a hardening of the skin, forming a nodule looking pimple or a\\r\\nmole and having a dark red color, due to tortuous blood vessels, upon the\\r\\nsides of the nose near the eyes, upon the cheek bones, forehead or\\r\\ntemples. This form of epithelioma is called rodent ulcer, flat epithelioma\\r\\nor cancroid and sometimes does little harm for many years, but should\\r\\nreceive the attention of a physician familiar with cancer and its\\r\\neradication.\\r\\n\\r\\nDeep or squamous cancer occurs on the lip, the tongue or the forehead or\\r\\nwherever the mucous membrane joins the skin, and is characterized by a\\r\\nhard, deep-seated sore formed upon any such part, growing down into the\\r\\nflesh and having a dark red or purplish-red color.\\r\\n\\r\\n[334 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nIf such a cancer is suspected of being present, the patient should at once\\r\\nseek diagnosis from a competent physician. Cancer of the lip is more\\r\\nfrequent in men than in women, occurring usually in the under lip and\\r\\ncalled \"Smoker\\'s Cancer.\" Any hard persistent nodule in the under lip\\r\\nshould cause suspicion and should be taken to a skilled surgeon, as cancer\\r\\nof the under lip is easily removed when in its early stage of development.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCANCER OF THE STOMACH.--The beginning of cancer of the stomach is very\\r\\ndifficult to recognize and it is far safer and wiser, upon the appearance\\r\\nof the first suspicious symptom, to seek the aid of some physician skilled\\r\\nin cancer diagnosis than to ignore and neglect these early warnings of the\\r\\ndisease. Although cancer of the stomach may occur in younger persons, it\\r\\nis usually met with in persons after forty years of age. Therefore, any\\r\\nperson at this age who suffers from continuous indigestion or\\r\\ncharacterized by retention and prolonged fermentation of food in the\\r\\nstomach, should at once consult a competent physician. In the early stages\\r\\nof the cancer of the stomach the patient loses weight, but in the later\\r\\nstages there is more or less pain.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhenever a physician finds that a patient has a pappy, insipid taste with\\r\\na furred, pale, rarely dry and red tongue, and is suffering from\\r\\ncontinuous, dull sensations or pain in the region of the stomach,\\r\\nperiodically increasing to paroxysms, often induced by pressure or\\r\\nincreased by it, together with a sensation of weight, drawing pains of\\r\\nvarying character, and frequent pain in the shoulder, loss of appetite,\\r\\nfrequent belching of fetid gas from the stomach, severe and frequent\\r\\nvomiting, often periodical, often occurring before partaking of a meal but\\r\\nmore often afterwards with slight indigestion, but vomitus being more or\\r\\nless watery and containing mucus and blood, usually decomposed and\\r\\nrecurring frequently, together with constipation of the bowels, the skin\\r\\nbeing sallow, yellowish, dry and flaccid, and losing weight and strength,\\r\\nhe should suspect cancer of the stomach and where possible advise an\\r\\nimmediate surgical operation for the removal of the cancer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCANCER OF THE UTERUS.--What women should know regarding it. The menopause\\r\\nor change of life comes on gradually, rarely suddenly. It is not preceded\\r\\nby excessive flowing or discharge or pain in a healthy woman.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy cancer period is understood those years after forty, although rarely it\\r\\nmay occur earlier. The first symptoms of uterine cancer are:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Profuse flowing, even if only a day more than usual. Flowing or\\r\\nspotting during the interval or after the use of a syringe or the movement\\r\\nof the bowels.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Whites or Leucorrhea, if not existing previously. If existing but\\r\\ngetting more profuse, watery, irritating, or producing itching is a very\\r\\nsuspicious symptom.\\r\\n\\r\\n[CONSTITUTIONAL DISEASES 335]\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Loss of weight, if no other cause is apparent. Pain in the region of\\r\\nthe womb, back or side.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf any of the above symptoms occur after the age of thirty-five or forty,\\r\\na woman should seek relief and insist on thorough investigation of the\\r\\ncause and prompt treatment.\\r\\n\\r\\nCancer is always at first a local disease and can be removed if early\\r\\nrecognized and an absolute, permanent cure brought about.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCANCER OF THE BREAST.--Eighty-one per cent of an tumors of the breast are\\r\\ncancer or become so. Whenever a woman feels a lump in her breast,\\r\\nparticularly if she be at the cancerous age, she should consult a skilled\\r\\nphysician at once and keep that breast under medical observation. If so\\r\\nadvised by her physician or by a skilled surgeon, she should have an\\r\\noperation for the removal of the cancer, as it can be completely\\r\\neradicated when operated upon in its early stages. If left to grow and\\r\\ndevelop it will get beyond the aid of even the most skillful surgeon.\\r\\nEarly diagnosis plus surgery is the only hope for a cancerous person.\\r\\nOperation offers a most hopeful outlook for those afflicted with cancer.\\r\\nIt is more important to make an early diagnosis in cancer of the breast\\r\\nthan it is in appendicitis.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCANCER (CARCINOMA).--This is very malignant. This kind is divided into two\\r\\nclasses, Scirrhus and Epithelial.\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Scirrhus cancer. This is a hard, irregular growth of moderate size. Its\\r\\nspecial seat is the breast, the pyloric (smaller) end of the stomach and\\r\\nin few instances the glands of the skin.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoft Medullary or Encephaloid cancer. This type resembles brain tissue\\r\\nboth in appearance and consistence. It appears quite soft and may be\\r\\nmistaken for an abscess. In form, it differs according to the organ\\r\\nattacked. Special seats: The testicle, liver, bladder, kidney, ovary, the\\r\\neye and more rarely the breast.\\r\\n\\r\\nColloid cancer; jelly-like substance.--The cancer cells have undergone a\\r\\ndegeneration in one of the preceding varieties. The material it contains\\r\\nis a semi-translucent, glistening, jelly-like substance. Its special\\r\\nseats are the stomach, bowel, omentum, ovary and, occasionally, the\\r\\nbreast.\\r\\n\\r\\nDiagnosis.--This kind is very rare before thirty years of age and common\\r\\nafter forty. They involve the gland early, contrary to what the sarcoma\\r\\nvariety does. Innocent growths occur, as a rule, in younger patients, do\\r\\nnot grow so rapidly, do not become adherent to neighboring parts and do\\r\\nnot ulcerate.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. The Epithelial Cancer (Carcinoma).--These always spring from free\\r\\nepithelium-clad surfaces, as the skin, and mucous membranes or from the\\r\\nglands of the same. These growths appear with great frequency at the\\r\\npoints of junction of mucous membranes and skin surfaces, probably because\\r\\nthese parts are subjected to more frequent and varied forms of mechanical\\r\\nand chemical irritation, Special seats: Skin surfaces, the nose, the lower\\r\\nlip, the penis and scrotum, the vulva, the anus (mucous surfaces), tongue,\\r\\npalate, gums, tonsils, larynx, pharynx, gullet, bladder, womb.\\r\\n\\r\\n[336 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nMOTHERS\\' REMEDIES.--l. Cancer, Simple Remedy for.--\"Give a teaspoonful of\\r\\nsarsaparilla tea four times daily, made with two ounces of sarsaparilla\\r\\nroot and quart of water boiled to one pint and apply to cancer growth a\\r\\npoultice made of carrots scraped or mashed cranberries.\" These simple\\r\\nremedies will relieve and often cure growths taken for cancers, but if it\\r\\nis really a cancerous growth no medicine will help and a physician should\\r\\nbe consulted at once.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Cancer, Nettles and Laudanum Will Help.--\"Take the juice of common\\r\\nnettles inwardly and mix a little laudanum with the juice and rub the\\r\\nparts outwardly. Cancer has often yielded to this treatment.\" This remedy\\r\\nwill no doubt help an ugly looking ulcer, repeatedly taken for cancer, by\\r\\nthe patients themselves and frequently the doctor. It is always well to\\r\\ngive this simple home remedy a trial, at least, for it is frequently\\r\\nadmitted by the medical fraternity to-day that ugly ulcers are often\\r\\ntreated in this way as cancers, sometimes to the lasting detriment of the\\r\\nsufferer. Then why not try some efficient home remedy like the above until\\r\\nyou are certain that it is a cancer?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTUMORS.--A tumor is a new growth which produces a localized enlargement of\\r\\na part, or an organ, has no tendency to a spontaneous cure, has no useful\\r\\nfunction, in most cases tends to grow during the whole of the individual\\'s\\r\\nlife. Clinically, tumors are divided into the benign and the malignant.\\r\\n\\r\\nA benign tumor is usually composed of tissues, resembling those in which\\r\\nit originates.\\r\\n\\r\\nA malignant tumor usually consists of tissues widely different from those\\r\\nin which it originates; its growth is rapid and therefore often painful;\\r\\nit infiltrates all the surrounding tissues, however resistant, even bone,\\r\\nbecause it is never encapsulated; it thus early becomes immovable; the\\r\\noverlying skin is apt to become adherent, especially when the breast is\\r\\ninvolved. Sooner or later it usually infects the group of lymphatic glands\\r\\nintervening between it and the venous circulation and from these new\\r\\ncentres, or directly through the veins, gives rise to secondary deposits\\r\\nin the internal organs.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome varieties. 1. Fibrous tumors; these consist of fibrous tissues. 2.\\r\\nFatty tumors (or lipomata); these consist of normal fat tissue. 3.\\r\\nCartilaginous tumors; consist of cartilage. 4. Osseous (bony) tumors. 5.\\r\\nMucous tumors (myxomata). 6. Muscular tumors (myomata). 7. Vascular tumors\\r\\n(Angeiomata). 8. Nerve tumors (Neuromata).\\r\\n\\r\\nMalignant Sarcoma (Sarcomata).--These are a variety of tumors. The result\\r\\nof these varies with the location of the tumor. If located in the jaw, an\\r\\noperation may cure it. If in the tonsil or lymphatic gland, it destroys\\r\\nlife rapidly. If in the sub-cutaneous tissue, it may be repeatedly\\r\\nremoved, the system remaining free, or the amputation of the limb involved\\r\\nwill probably cure the disease.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Circulatory System.]\\r\\n\\r\\n[CONSTITUTIONAL DISEASES 337]\\r\\n\\r\\nTUMORS.--Diagnosis. It is uncommon under thirty, quite common after.\\r\\nEpithelioma of the lower lip is limited almost entirely to men. If, then,\\r\\na man of from forty to seventy develops a small tumor in the lower lip\\r\\nwhich ulcerates early, it is likely to be the cancer. The same applies to\\r\\nsome extent to the tongue. These growths and sores need attention early.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--The best treatment is early free removal of the entire growth\\r\\nbefore the glands are involved.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDISEASES OF THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM\\r\\n\\r\\nHEART DISEASE, Emergency Treatment.--For collapse or fainting, loosen\\r\\nclothing, lie down, rub camphor on forehead, and keep quiet.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Revive When Fainting.--Smell of camphor or aromatic spirits of ammonia.\\r\\nPut one to two teaspoonfuls of whisky or brandy in eight teaspoonfuls of\\r\\nhot water, and give one or two teaspoonfuls at a time and repeat often.\\r\\nSome are not accustomed to stimulants and it may strangle them, so give it\\r\\nslowly.

Break one in a handkerchief and put the\\r\\nhandkerchief to the patient\\'s nose so that he may inhale the fumes.\\r\\n\\r\\nStimulant.--A person with heart valvular trouble should always carry\\r\\npearls of amylnitrite. Inhale slowly so as not to get too much of it at\\r\\nonce.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHEART FAILURE.--The pulse may be slow and weak or fast and weak.\\r\\n\\r\\nDigitalis.--Give five drops of the tincture in a little water. Another\\r\\ndose can be given in fifteen minutes. Then another in an hour, if\\r\\nnecessary.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPALPITATION OF THE HEART.--Irregular or forcible heart beat action usually\\r\\nperceived by the person troubled.\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses.--Hysteria, nervous exhaustion, violent emotions or sexual\\r\\nexcesses; overdose of tea and coffee: alcohol or tobacco.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--There may be only a sensation of fluttering with that of\\r\\ndistention or emptiness of the heart. There may be flushing of the skin,\\r\\nviolent beating of the superficial arteries, with rapid pulse, difficult\\r\\nbreathing and nervousness. Attack lasts from a few minutes to several\\r\\nhours.\\r\\n\\r\\n[338 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nMOTHERS\\' REMEDIES.-l.

Take\\r\\none teaspoonful for three nights, then skip three nights.\" This is an\\r\\nold-time remedy known to be especially good, as the salts move the bowels\\r\\nand the cream of tartar acts on the kidneys, carrying off the impurities\\r\\nthat should be thrown off from these organs.\\r\\n\\r\\nPHYSICIAN\\'S TREATMENT FOR PALPITATION.--When caused by valvular trouble,\\r\\ndigitalis can be given as above directed under heart failure.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Caused by the Stomach.--From gas or too much food, take salts to move\\r\\nthe bowels. Hot whisky is good when caused by gas; or soda, one\\r\\nteaspoonful in hot water is also good when gas causes palpitation.\\r\\n\\r\\n[CIRCULATORY DISEASES 339]\\r\\n\\r\\nDifficult Breathing.--If caused by gas, soda, hot whisky or brandy will\\r\\nrelieve. If caused by too fast beating of the heart, give digitalis as\\r\\nabove directed. If caused by dropsy, the regular remedies for dropsy. If\\r\\nthe dropsy is due to scanty urine you can use infusion of digitalis, dose\\r\\none to four drams; or cream of tartar and epsom salts, equal parts, to\\r\\nkeep the bowels open freely.\\r\\n\\r\\nPHYSICIAN\\'S CAUTIONS:--Quiet the patient\\'s mind and assure him there is no\\r\\nactual danger; moderate exercise should be taken as a rule with advantage.\\r\\nRegular hours should be kept and at least ten hours out of twenty-four\\r\\nshould be spent in lying down. A tepid bath may be taken in the morning,\\r\\nor if the patient is weakly and nervous, in the evening, followed by a\\r\\nthorough rubbing. No hot baths or Turkish bath. Tea, coffee and alcohol\\r\\nare prohibited. Diet should be light, and the patient should avoid\\r\\novereating at any meals. Foods that cause gas should not be used. If a\\r\\nsmoker the patient must give up tobacco. Sexual excitement is very\\r\\npernicious, and the patient should be warned especially on this point.\\r\\nAbsolute rest for the distressing attacks of palpitation which occur with\\r\\nnervous exhaustion. In these cases we find the most distressing throbbing\\r\\nin the abdomen, which is apt to come after meals, and is very much\\r\\naggravated by the accumulation of gas.\\r\\n\\r\\nDiet.--A person with heart disease should not bring on palpitation from\\r\\nover-eating or eating the wrong kind of food. Such a person dare not be a\\r\\nglutton. The diet must be simple, nutritious, but food that is easily\\r\\ndigested. Any food that causes trouble must be avoided; starchy foods,\\r\\nspiced foods, rich greasy foods, are not healthy for such a person. The\\r\\nstomach must be carefully treated by such a patient. The bowels should\\r\\nmove daily. The kidneys should always do good work and pass enough urine\\r\\nand of the right color and consistency. Stimulants like alcohol, tea and\\r\\ncoffee are not to be used. Weak cocoa is all right in most cases. Hot\\r\\nwater, if any drink must be taken, at meals. Such a patient in order to\\r\\nlive and live comfortably, must take life easy. He cannot afford to run,\\r\\nto over lift, or over exert, to walk fast upstairs, hurry or to \"catch the\\r\\ncar.\" He must not get angry or excited. Games of all kinds that have a\\r\\ntendency to make him nervous must be avoided. The same caution applies to\\r\\nexciting literature. In short, a patient with organic heart disease must\\r\\nbe a drone in the hum of this busy, fast-rushing life, if he would hope to\\r\\nkeep the spark of life for many years. Sleep, rest and quiet is a better\\r\\nmotto for you than the strenuous life.\\r\\n\\r\\n[340  MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Heart.--The heart is the central organ of the entire system and\\r\\nconsists of a hollow muscle; by its contraction the blood is pumped to all\\r\\nparts of the body through a complicated series of tubes, termed arteries.\\r\\nThe arteries undergo enormous ramifications (branchings) in their course\\r\\nthroughout the body and end in very minute vessels, called arterioles,\\r\\nwhich in their turn open into a close meshed network of microscopic (very\\r\\nminute) vessels, termed capillaries. After the blood has passed through\\r\\nthe capillaries it is collected into a series of larger vessels called\\r\\nveins by which it is returned to the heart. The passage of the blood\\r\\nthrough the heart and blood vessels constitutes what is termed the\\r\\ncirculation of the blood. The human heart is divided by a septum\\r\\n(partition) into two halves, right and left, each half being further\\r\\nconstricted into, two cavities, the upper of the two being termed the\\r\\nauricle and the lower the ventricle. The heart consists of four chambers\\r\\nor cavities, two forming the right half, the right auricle and right\\r\\nventricle, and two forming the left half, the left auricle and left\\r\\nventricle. The right half of the heart contains the venous or impure\\r\\nblood; the left the arterial or pure blood. From the cavity of the left\\r\\nventricle the pure blood is carried into a large artery, the aorta,\\r\\nthrough the numerous branches of which it is distributed to all parts of\\r\\nthe body, with the exception of the lungs. In its passage through the\\r\\ncapillaries of the body the blood gives up to the tissues the material\\r\\nnecessary for their growth and nourishment and at the same time receives\\r\\nfrom the tissues the waste products resulting from their metabolism, that\\r\\nis, the building up and tearing down of the tissues, and in so doing\\r\\nbecomes changed from arterial or pure blood into venous or impure blood,\\r\\nwhich is collected by the veins and through them returned to the right\\r\\nauricle of the heart.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom this cavity the impure blood passes into the right ventricle from\\r\\nwhich it is conveyed through the pulmonary (lung) arteries to the lungs.\\r\\nIn the capillaries of the lungs it again becomes arterialized by the air\\r\\nthat fills the lungs and is then carried to the left auricle by the\\r\\npulmonary veins. From this cavity it passes into that of the left\\r\\nventricle, from which the cycle once more begins. The heart, then, is a\\r\\nhollow muscular organ of a conical form, placed between the lungs and\\r\\nenclosed in the cavity of the pericardium. It is placed obliquely in the\\r\\nchest. The broad attached end or base is directed upwards, backwards and\\r\\nto the right and extends up to the right as high as the second rib and the\\r\\ncenter of the base lies near the surface underneath the breast bone. The\\r\\napex (point) is directed downwards, forward and to the left and\\r\\ncorresponds to the space between the cartilage of the fifth and sixth\\r\\nribs, three-fourths of an inch to the inner side, and one and one-half\\r\\ninches below the nipple, or about three and one-half inches from the\\r\\nmiddle line of the breast bone. The heart is placed behind the lower two-\\r\\nthirds of the breast bone and extends from the median line three inches to\\r\\nthe left half of the cavity of the chest and one and one-half inches to\\r\\nthe right half of the cavity of the chest.\\r\\n\\r\\nSize: In adults it is five inches long, three and one-half inches in\\r\\nbreadth at its broadest part and two and one-half inches in thickness.\\r\\nWeight in the male ten to twelve ounces; in the female eight to ten. It\\r\\nincreases up to an advanced period of life. The tricuspid valve (three\\r\\nsegments) closes the opening between the right auricle and right\\r\\nventricle. Pulmonary semilunar valves guard the orifice of the pulmonary\\r\\nartery, keeping the blood from flowing back into the right ventricle. The\\r\\nmitral valve guards the opening to the left ventricle from the left\\r\\nauricle. The semilunar valves surround the opening from the left ventricle\\r\\ninto the aorta and keep the blood from flowing back. If any one of these\\r\\nvalves becomes diseased it may not thoroughly close the opening it is\\r\\nplaced to guard and then we have a train of important symptoms.\\r\\n\\r\\n[CIRCULATORY DISEASES 341]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPERICARDITIS.--This is an inflammation of the pericardium, the sac\\r\\ncontaining the heart.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrimary or First Causes.--They refer in this disease to a peculiar\\r\\nconstitution. Children that have a tuberculous constitution are more\\r\\nliable to this disease. Acute rheumatism or tonsilitis are the causes and\\r\\nthis trouble follows or goes with them. Infectious diseases also cause it.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--Slight pain in the heart region, fever moderate. These subside\\r\\nor effusion may set in and this usually occurs with acute rheumatism,\\r\\ntuberculosis and septicemia. Sometimes these symptoms are absent.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment of Pericarditis.--The patient must rest quietly in bed and a\\r\\ndoctor should be in attendance. An ice bag placed over the heart\\r\\nfrequently gives relief and quiets the distress and pain. There is apt to\\r\\nbe liquid in the sac (pericardium) and to lessen the tendency to this\\r\\nthere should not be much drink or liquid food taken. There should be what\\r\\nis called a dry diet. (See Nursing Department for this.)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nENDOCARDITIS.--Inflammation of the lining of the heart chiefly confined to\\r\\nthe valves; it may be acute or chronic.\\r\\n\\r\\nSimple Kind, Cause.--Occurs at all ages, but most often in children and\\r\\nyoung adults. It most frequently comes with acute rheumatism, chorea,\\r\\ntonsilitis, scarlet fever, and pneumonia. The valves in the left heart are\\r\\nmost often affected, the mitral simply swollen or bearing small growths.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--If it is caused by acute rheumatism, there may be higher\\r\\ntemperature, without increase of joint symptoms. Heart beats faster and is\\r\\nirregular. It may run into chronic valvular disease.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment of Endocarditis.--Preventive.--Much can be done to prevent this\\r\\ndisease by closely watching the patient having the disease that causes it.\\r\\nThe heart should be closely watched. Acute inflammatory rheumatism is a\\r\\nfrequent cause and the heart must be watched continually in this disease.\\r\\nWhen the patient has this disease he must be quiet and in bed. This is\\r\\nessential. A doctor must be called, for the disease is serious and\\r\\ndangerous.\\r\\n\\r\\nDiet.--Should be liquid. Milk or preparations made with it is the usual\\r\\ndiet. Care must be taken that the stomach and bowels be not disordered.\\r\\nGas collecting in the stomach causes much distress to one who has\\r\\nendocarditis or valvular disease.\\r\\n\\r\\nCaution.--Avoid early exertion after getting well.\\r\\n\\r\\n[342 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHRONIC ENDOCARDITIS.--Usually occurs in persons under middle age.\\r\\nGenerally follows acute endocarditis. It may be caused by syphilis,\\r\\nalcoholism, gout, and prolonged over-exertion. The edges of the valve\\r\\nbecome thickened and then the thickened parts separate and cannot meet\\r\\nexactly and therefore fail to close the opening they are set to guard.\\r\\n\\r\\nCHRONIC VALVULAR DISEASE.--Results of valve lesions. Narrowing of a valve\\r\\ncauses increased difficulty in emptying the chamber of the heart behind\\r\\nit. Insufficiency of a valve allows the return of the blood through the\\r\\nvalve during the dilation of a chamber, thus increasing the amount of\\r\\nblood entering the chamber beyond the normal. Either trouble causes\\r\\ndilation of the chamber and compensatory hypertrophy. Enlargement of its\\r\\nwall must take place in order to perform the extra work demanded\\r\\nconstantly, for the normal reserve force of the heart muscles can\\r\\naccomplish the extra task only temporarily. This enlargement increases the\\r\\nworking power of the heart to above normal, but the organ is relatively\\r\\nless efficient than the normal heart, as its reserve force is less and\\r\\nsudden or unusual exertion may cause disturbance or failure of the\\r\\ncompensation acquired by the enlargement. If this loss of reserve force is\\r\\ntemporary, compensation is restored by further enlargement and by\\r\\ndiminution, by rest, of the work demanded of the heart. Any valvular\\r\\nlesion, whether a stenosis (narrowing) of the outlet or insufficiency from\\r\\nthe moment of its origin, leads to certain alterations in the distribution\\r\\nof pressure upon each side of the affected valve. If the body of the heart\\r\\nitself did not possess a series of powerful compensatory aids, that is,\\r\\nthe power of making good a defect or loss, or restoring a lost balance, to\\r\\nimprove this relation of altered pressure, then every serious lesion at\\r\\nits very beginning would not only cause serious general disturbances of\\r\\ncirculation, but very soon prove fatal. Without compensation of the power\\r\\nof making good the defect or loss, the blood in every valvular disease or\\r\\nlesion would be collected behind the diseased valve. The heart\\'s reserve\\r\\npower prevents to a certain extent such a dangerous condition; the\\r\\nsections of the heart lying behind the diseased valve work harder,\\r\\ndiminish the blood stoppage and furnish enough blood to the peripheral\\r\\narteries. The reserve force is used in stenosis to overcome the obstacle,\\r\\nwhereas in insufficiency it must force more blood forward during the\\r\\nsucceeding phase through the diseased valve. To effect this increased work\\r\\npermanently, anatomic changes in the heart are bound to follow. The\\r\\nchanges consist in hypertrophy (enlargement of the heart muscle) and\\r\\ndilatation of the different chambers. Under this head, compensation, is\\r\\nincluded the increased filling and increased work of certain heart\\r\\nchambers with their resulting dilatation and hypertrophy. But this\\r\\ncompensation cannot last forever. It fails sometimes and certain symptoms\\r\\nfollow as hereafter related. Therefore persons who have valvular disease\\r\\nand who have been informed that the heart has adapted itself to the\\r\\ncondition by enlarging of its walls and chambers and thus forming the\\r\\ncondition called compensation, should be very careful of their mode of\\r\\nliving and not put any undue or sudden strain upon the heart that might\\r\\ndestroy the conditions that make compensation continue. In the following\\r\\npages symptoms are given showing what happens when compensation continues\\r\\nand when it fails.\\r\\n\\r\\n[CIRCULATORY DISEASES 343]\\r\\n\\r\\nAORTIC INSUFFICIENCY OR INCOMPETENCY.--The valves are not doing their work\\r\\nthoroughly.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--They are often long absent; headache, dizziness, faintness,\\r\\nflashes of light, difficult breathing, and palpitation on exertion, and\\r\\npain in the heart region may occur early. The pain may be dull and\\r\\nlocalized, or sharp and radiating to the neck or left arm. When\\r\\ncompensation fails, we have difficult breathing, which is worse at night,\\r\\nswelling of the eyes and feet, cough, anemia. Sudden death is more common\\r\\nin this than with any other valvular disease. You can hear a soft blowing\\r\\nsound by listening with your ear.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNARROWING (Aortic Stenosis).--Caused by chronic endocarditis, etc. Their\\r\\nvalve segments are usually adherent to each other by their margins and are\\r\\nthickened and distorted.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--When compensation is gone, diminished blood in the brain causes\\r\\ndizziness and faintness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMITRAL INSUFFICIENCY OR INCOMPETENCY.--This is the most common valvular\\r\\ndisease. The segments of the valve may be shortened and deformed. There is\\r\\noften stenosis (narrowing) caused by this deformity. The effects are\\r\\nregurgitation, flowing back of blood from the left ventricle into the left\\r\\nauricle, which is also receiving blood from the lungs, causing dilatation\\r\\nof the auricle and its enlargement to expel the extra blood; dilatation\\r\\nand other enlargement of the left ventricle occurs on account of the large\\r\\nquantity of blood forced in by the auricle; obstruction to flow of blood\\r\\nfrom pulmonary veins due to extra blood in left auricle, hence dilatation\\r\\nand enlargement of right ventricle which forces blood through the lungs;\\r\\ndilatation and enlargement of right auricle.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--If compensation is slightly disturbed we have blueness\\r\\n(cyanosis), clubbing of the fingers, hard breathing on exertion, and\\r\\nattacks of bronchitis and bleeding from the lungs. If compensation is\\r\\nseriously disturbed we are likely to have the blueness (cyanosis) more\\r\\nmarked, heart beat feeble and irregular, constant hard breathing, with\\r\\ncough and water or bloody sputum, dropsy in the feet first and going up\\r\\nand involving the abdomen and chest cavities.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMITRAL STENOSIS.--This is the narrowing of the valve opening. It is most\\r\\ncommon in young persons, chiefly females. The narrowing of the valve\\r\\nopening may be due to thickening or hardening of the valve segments,\\r\\nadhesion of their edges, thickening and contraction of the tendinous cords\\r\\nof the valve ring.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--Similar to mitral insufficiency, but they develop slower and\\r\\nthose symptoms of venous congestion of the lungs, liver, etc., are more\\r\\nmarked; bleeding from the lungs is more common.\\r\\n\\r\\n[344 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nTRICUSPID (VALVE) INSUFFICIENCY.--Cause.--Usually due to dilatation of the\\r\\nright ventricle in mitral disease or with lung emphysema or other\\r\\nobstruction to the lungs\\' circulation.\\r\\n\\r\\nTRICUSPID STENOSIS (NARROWING).--Rare except in cases from the time of\\r\\nbirth.\\r\\n\\r\\nRecovery from the valvular disease, depends upon the degree of\\r\\ncompensation maintained and is best when this is acquired spontaneously.\\r\\nThis is to be judged by the heart action. The prognosis is poor in\\r\\nchildren. It is better in women than in men.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment (a) While Compensated.--Medicine is not necessary at this\\r\\nperiod. The patient should lead a quiet, regulated, orderly life, free\\r\\nfrom excitement and worry; and the risk of certain death makes it\\r\\nnecessary that those suffering from a disease of the aorta should be\\r\\nespecially warned against over-exertion and hurry. An ordinary healthy\\r\\ndiet in moderate quantities should be taken, tobacco and stimulants not\\r\\nallowed at all.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe feelings of the patient must control the amount of exercise; so long\\r\\nas no heart distress or palpitation follows, moderate exercise will be of\\r\\ngreat help. A daily bath is good. No hot baths should be taken and a\\r\\nTurkish bath absolutely prohibited. For the full-blooded, fleshy patient\\r\\nan occasional dose of salts should be taken. Patients with a valvular\\r\\ntrouble should not go into any very high altitudes; over-exertion, mental\\r\\nworry and poor digestion are harmful.\\r\\n\\r\\n(b) The stage of broken compensation. Rest. Disturbed compensation may be\\r\\ncompletely restored by rest of the body. In many cases with swelling of\\r\\nthe ankles, moderate dilatation of the heart and irregularity of the\\r\\npulse, the rest in bed, a few doses of the compound tincture of cardamon\\r\\nand a saline purge suffice within a week or ten days to restore the\\r\\ncompensation. For medicine a doctor must be consulted as each individual\\r\\ncase must be treated according to its peculiar symptoms.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFATTY HEART.--This occurs often in old age, prolonged, infectious, wasting\\r\\ndisease, anemia, alcoholism, poisoning by phosphorus and arsenic.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nANGINA PECTORIS.--True angina, which is a rare disease, is characterized\\r\\nby paroxysms of agonizing pain in the region of the heart, extending into\\r\\nthe arms and neck. In violent attacks there is the sensation of impending\\r\\ndeath. Usually during the exertion and excitement, sudden onset of\\r\\nagonizing pain in the region of the heart and a sense of constriction, as\\r\\nif the heart had been seized in a vise. The pains radiate up the neck and\\r\\ndown the arm. The fingers may be numb. The patient remains motionless and\\r\\nsilent, the face usually pale or ashy with profuse perspiration. Lasts for\\r\\nseveral seconds or a minute or two.\\r\\n\\r\\n[CIRCULATORY DISEASES 345]\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--Live an absolutely quiet life, avoid excitement and sudden\\r\\nmuscular exertion. During the attack, break a pearl of amylnitrite in a\\r\\nhandkerchief and inhale the fumes. These should always be carried. If no\\r\\nrelief is had in a minute or two chloroform should be given at once. It is\\r\\ndangerous and you must look to your physician for advice and treatment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nARTERIOSCLEROSIS.--A localized or diffused thickness of the inner coat and\\r\\nthen of the other coats of the arteries. Arteries look lumpy and are\\r\\ncrooked, dilated with stiff, thin or calcified walls. All coats,\\r\\nespecially the middle, show degeneration. It usually comes in later life.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--Regulate the mode of life, avoid alcohol, excess of eating,\\r\\ndrinking, exertion, excitement and worry. Keep the bowels and kidneys\\r\\nacting regularly. There is no medicine for it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nANEURISM.--This is a local dilatation of an artery. A local tumor.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--Absolute rest, restrict fluids. There is always danger from\\r\\nrupture.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMYOCARDITIS.--This is an inflammation of the muscle substance of the\\r\\nheart. It may be acute or chronic.\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses.--Endocarditis and pericarditis in the course of rheumatism; acute\\r\\nfevers like typhoid, etc.; clots lodging in the heart arteries, coming\\r\\nfrom diseases such as septicemia and pyemia.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--The heart is weak. The pulse is rapid, small and irregular,\\r\\npalpitation and fainty sensations come on suddenly during the course of\\r\\ndiseases mentioned. The outlook is serious and life may end suddenly.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--The same as that given for endocarditis. Absolute rest is\\r\\nnecessary. A good nourishing diet must be given and a doctor is always\\r\\nneeded.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPHLEBITIS, INFLAMMATION OF THE VEINS.--Causes.--Some irritation of the\\r\\nvein, as a puncture or any other injury accompanied by infection.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--Pain and tenderness along the course of the vein with\\r\\ndiscolored skin and acute swelling (watery) below the obstruction. Pulse\\r\\nrapid, high temperature, chills, dry and brown tongue and pain.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--Absolute quiet is necessary, with the affected limb elevated.\\r\\nLead and laudanum wash should be applied, or hot antiseptic fomentations\\r\\nif an abscess is forming. An abscess should be opened, keep up the\\r\\npatient\\'s strength.\\r\\n\\r\\n[346 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nVARICOSE VEINS (Varix).--This term means an enlarged, elongated, tortuous,\\r\\nknotty condition of the veins. The term \"varicose veins\" is restricted in\\r\\ngeneral use to the veins of the extremities, and especially those\\r\\nbelonging to the lower extremity. The disease begins with a slow dilation\\r\\nof the vein, which gradually becomes thickened and tortuous. The inner\\r\\nlining membrane or coat of the vein is altered, the valves are shortened\\r\\nand thus rendered insufficient to support the column of blood. The outer\\r\\ncoat becomes thickened. The varicose conditions affect chiefly the\\r\\nsuperficial veins.\\r\\n\\r\\nPredisposing Causes.--They are most frequent in the female sex. The\\r\\ntendency increases as the age advances. Obstruction. Anything that\\r\\nobstructs the full return of blood in the veins, as tight garters below\\r\\nthe knee, etc. Standing work may bring it on.\\r\\n\\r\\nExciting Causes.--Tumors in the pelvis; diseases of the heart and lungs;\\r\\npregnancy. These all obstruct the full return of blood in the veins.\\r\\n\\r\\nPHYSICIANS\\' TREATMENT FOR VARICOSE VEINS.--Palliative.--Remove the cause\\r\\nif possible. Treat the heart and lung troubles. Remove the pelvic tumors.\\r\\nIn pregnancy, the woman afflicted with this trouble should not be much on\\r\\nher feet, but should remain lying down in bed as much as possible. This\\r\\nposition removes the weight of the pregnant womb from the veins and allows\\r\\na free return of the venous blood. An elastic bandage, or a perfectly\\r\\nfitting elastic stocking, supports the veins, equalizes the circulation\\r\\nand turns the flow to the deeper veins, which do not, as a rule, become\\r\\nvaricose. This silk stocking should be made to order. This treatment gives\\r\\nmuch comfort in chronic varicose veins.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDISEASES OF THE EYE AND EAR\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first thing we notice in looking at the eye may be the lids and at\\r\\neach edge are the eyelashes. When this edge becomes inflamed it is called\\r\\nBlenharitis Marginalis or inflammation of the margin of the eyelids. It is\\r\\ncalled thus from the name of the eyelid \"Blepharon;\" It is always means\\r\\ninflammation.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf we turn down the lower lid and turn up the upper, we see a red membrane\\r\\ncalled the conjunctiva (connecting). This is the mucous membrane of the\\r\\neye. It lines the inner surface of both lids and is reflected over the\\r\\nfore part of the Sclerotic and Cornea--two other coats of the eye, The\\r\\npalpebral or eyelid portion of the conjunctiva is thick, opaque, highly\\r\\nvascular (filled with blood vessels) and covered with numerous papillae.\\r\\nIt turns back (reflects) over the Cornea, but it consists only of a very\\r\\nthin structure (epithelium) forming the anterior layer of the cornea and\\r\\nis, in health, perfectly transparent. Upon the sclerotic it is loosely\\r\\nattached to the globe. When the conjunctiva becomes inflamed it is called\\r\\n(Conjunctiv(a)itis) conjunctivitis. The sclerotic-cornea forms the\\r\\nexternal tunic (coat) of the eyeball, the sclerotic being opaque and\\r\\nforming the posterior five-sixths of the globe; the cornea, which forms\\r\\nthe remaining sixth (the front white part that is plainly seen) being\\r\\ntransparent. The sclerotic (means dense and hard) serves to maintain the\\r\\nform of the globe, the eyeball.\\r\\n\\r\\n[EYE AND EAR 347]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cornea.--This is almost circular in shape. It is convex anteriorly and\\r\\nprojects forward from the sclerotic in the same manner that a watch glass\\r\\ndoes from its case. This layer covers what we call the pupil.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second tunic or coat (membrane) is formed from behind forward by the\\r\\nChoroid, the ciliary body and the Iris. The choroid is the vascular and\\r\\ndark coat covering the posterior five-sixths of the globe. The ciliary\\r\\nbody connects the choroid to the circumference of the iris. The iris is\\r\\nthe circular muscular septum (division) which hangs vertically behind the\\r\\ncornea, presenting in its center a large rounded opening, the pupil.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe choroid is a thin highly vascular membrane of a dark brown or\\r\\nchocolate color and is pierced behind by the optic nerve and in this\\r\\nsituation is firmly adherent to the sclerotic.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ciliary body comprises three muscles for its make-up and connects the\\r\\nchoroid to the circumference of the iris.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Iris (rainbow) has received its name from its various colors in\\r\\ndifferent individuals. It is a thin, circular shaped, contractile curtain,\\r\\nsuspended in the aqueous (watery) humor behind the cornea and in front of\\r\\nthe lens, being perforated a little to the nasal (nose) side of its centre\\r\\nby a circular opening, the pupil, for the transmission of light. By its\\r\\ncircumference it is continuous with the ciliary body, and its inner or\\r\\nfree edge forms the margin of the pupil. The anterior surface of the iris\\r\\nis variously colored in different individuals and marked by lines which\\r\\nconverge toward the pupil.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Retina.--This is a delicate membrane, upon the surface of which the\\r\\nimages of external objects are received. Its outer surface is in contact\\r\\nwith the choroid; its inner, with the vitreous (glass) body. Behind it is\\r\\ncontinuous with the optic nerve; it gradually diminishes in thickness from\\r\\nbehind forward. The retina is soft, semi-transparent and of a purple tint\\r\\nin the fresh state. Exactly in the centre of the posterior part of the\\r\\nretina corresponding to the axis of the eye, and at a point in which the\\r\\nsense of vision is most perfect, is an oval yellowish spot, called after\\r\\nits discoverer, the yellow spot or Macula lutea of Sommering.\\r\\n\\r\\nRefracting Media.--The aqueous humor completely fills the anterior and\\r\\nposterior chambers of the eyeball. The anterior chamber is the space\\r\\nbounded in front by the cornea; behind by the front of the iris. The\\r\\nposterior chamber is a narrow chink between the peripheral part of the\\r\\niris, the \"suspensory ligament\" of the lens and the \"ciliary processes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n[348 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe vitreous body forms about four-fifths of the entire globe, It fills\\r\\nthe concavity of the retina and is hollowed in front, forming a deep\\r\\ncavity, for the reception of the lens. It is perfectly transparent and of\\r\\nthe consistency of thin jelly. The fluid from the vitreous body resembles\\r\\nnearly pure water. The crystalline lens enclosed in its capsule is\\r\\nsituated immediately behind the pupil, in front of the vitreous body. The\\r\\nlens is a transparent, double-convex body. It is more convex on the\\r\\nposterior than on the anterior surface. The rays of light go through this\\r\\nbody and converge to a point at the back of the retina.\\r\\n\\r\\nBLEPHARITIS MARGINALIS.--This means a chronic inflammation of the margin\\r\\nor edge of the eyelids accompanied by congestion, thickening and\\r\\nulceration of the parts and the formation of scales and crusts.\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses.--The underlying cause is often an inflammation of the conjunctiva\\r\\nwhere the proper care is not taken in cleansing the roots of the lashes\\r\\nwhen the discharge collects.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther causes are keeping late hours, smoke and dust.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--The red swelling along the roots of the lashes is often the\\r\\nonly symptom. This comes and goes at the least excuse, such as eye strain,\\r\\nlate hours, dust and wind. Scales and dust form in the severe forms, of\\r\\nthe disease. It is most common in children, extends over many years and\\r\\nmay finally result in the loss of the lashes, with the edge of the lid,\\r\\nthickened, reddened and turned out.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--This is tedious. Fit glasses if there is eye strain, reform\\r\\nthe mode of life and attend to any constitutional disease that may tend to\\r\\nmake it worse.\\r\\n\\r\\nLocal treatment.--Keep the parts thoroughly clean. The edges of the lids\\r\\nshould be washed carefully with soap and warm water or mild solution of\\r\\nborax or soda until the crusts are all cleaned off and then use at night\\r\\nan ointment composed of the following ingredients:\\r\\n\\r\\n    Yellow oxide of Mercury       2-1/2 grains\\r\\n    Petrolatum                    2-1/2 drams\\r\\n\\r\\nMix and make an ointment and rub on the edge of the lids every night,\\r\\nfirst cleaning them. The conjunctivitis must be cured.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSTYE (HORDEOLUM).--This is a swelling beginning in a gland or glands at\\r\\nthe edge of the lid and pus forms finally.\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses.--Inflammation of the edge of the lid, stomach trouble, run down\\r\\ncondition, poorly fitted glasses, when glasses should be worn to relieve\\r\\nthe eye strain.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--Itching and burning feeling followed by a red swollen area\\r\\n(lump) at the edge of the lid. Later it comes to a point and discharges.\\r\\n\\r\\nCause.--Styes usually run their course in a few days or a week; another\\r\\nfrequently follows. When it does not reach the pus stage, it often leaves\\r\\na hard swelling (blind stye).\\r\\n\\r\\n[EYE AND EAR 349]\\r\\n\\r\\nMOTHER\\'S REMEDY. 1. Stye.--Home Method to Kill.--\"To hasten the pointing\\r\\nof a stye apply hot compresses for fifteen minutes every two hours. As ill\\r\\nhealth may be the cause, a tonic may be needed; glasses properly fitted\\r\\nshould be worn and a boric acid eyewash used until long after the stye has\\r\\ndisappeared.\" Applying hot compresses will relieve the congestion and\\r\\ngives much relief. Ill health produces a poor circulation of the blood and\\r\\na good tonic will be found beneficial. Styes are frequently produced by\\r\\nneed of glasses.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--Treat the stomach and system if necessary. Ice or cold cloths\\r\\nagainst the stye may abort it. If it goes on, hot fomentations will hasten\\r\\nit. It should then be opened up and scraped out. It will soon heal then\\r\\nand will not leave a lump.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nACUTE CATARRHAL CONJUNCTIVITIS (Pink Eye).--Definition.--This is an acute\\r\\ninflammation of the mucous membranes under the eyelids, and there is\\r\\ncongestion (too much blood), swelling and a discharge of mucus and pus.\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses.--Exposure to wind, dust, smoke, or irritating foreign substance,\\r\\ncinder, sand, etc. It may occur in epidemic form and then is contagious\\r\\nand is called \"pink eye.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--The lids appear stiff to the patient, the light causes\\r\\ndiscomfort and the patient fears it. Burning feeling as if there was some\\r\\ndirt, etc., under the lid, not much pain, but discomfort especially in the\\r\\nevening. The lids look swollen and red. The conjunctiva on the cornea is\\r\\nreddened and that on the lid is thickened, reddened and rough. The\\r\\ndischarge collects at the roots of the lashes or lies on the conjunctiva.\\r\\nThe lids are stuck together in the morning. The sight is slightly affected\\r\\nby the discharge on the cornea, which is otherwise clear. Sometimes little\\r\\n(minute) ulcerations are seen.\\r\\n\\r\\nCourse.--It may run into a chronic conjunctivitis. One eye is usually\\r\\nattacked a few days before the other. The first stage lasts a few hours or\\r\\na day and then the discharge follows which may last a few days or a week\\r\\nor more.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--First: Use gauze or cotton and dip in ice or cold water and\\r\\napply to the eyelids. A wash of hot water can be used to cleanse the eye\\r\\nor ten to sixty grains (one teaspoonful) of boric acid to an ounce of\\r\\nwater can be used as a wash also.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following remedies are good in combination as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n    Alum                  3 grains\\r\\n    Sulphate of Zinc      2 grains\\r\\n    Distilled Water       1 ounce\\r\\n\\r\\nMix and drop one drop into the eye two or three times daily. A weak\\r\\nsolution of tea can be used also as a wash. Anoint the lids at night with\\r\\nwhite (tube) vaselin.\\r\\n\\r\\n[350 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nINFLAMMATION OF THE EYE OF NEWLY BORN (OPHTHALMIA NEONATORUM).--This is a\\r\\nsevere inflammation of the conjunctiva in the new born infant, usually due\\r\\nto a discharge from the mother and it is characterized by a discharge of\\r\\npus.\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses.--Mild cases may come from a less violent form of infection from\\r\\nthe mother\\'s discharge from the vagina, or from outside causes. The\\r\\nmajority of the severe cases is due to a poison (the gonococcus\\r\\ninfection).\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--The first symptoms are swelling and redness, usually of both\\r\\neyes, usually occurring a few days after birth. Soon the discharge appears\\r\\nand shortly becomes creamy pus, which runs from the eyes when the swollen\\r\\nlids are partly opened. As the disease continues to advance, the membrane\\r\\nof the lid is thickened, red and velvety looking and the conjunctiva\\r\\n(membrane) in the eye is swollen, puffy and watery.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe disease may last from two to six weeks or longer.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the pus is not cleaned from the eye, the cornea may look dim and ulcers\\r\\nmay appear. If the ulcer eats through the cornea the iris is apt to be\\r\\ncaught in the opening and in the scar resulting from the ulcer. The cornea\\r\\nmay later bulge and protrude or the disease may involve the whole eye in\\r\\nan inflammation which may destroy it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe result generally depends upon how soon treatment is begun. If attended\\r\\nto early the great majority of cases recover. It is serious to neglect\\r\\nearly treatment for this disease. It causes a great many cases of\\r\\nblindness and generally the cases are neglected too long. Treatment must\\r\\nbegin before the disease begins. Immediately at the birth of the child,\\r\\nwhen if there is any poison in the eye due to a discharge in the mother\\'s\\r\\nvagina, it can be immediately cleansed.\\r\\n\\r\\nTREATMENT PREVENTIVE. What to do first.--As soon as the child is born and\\r\\nbefore its eyes are opened the discharges should be carefully wiped away\\r\\nfrom the lids with small squares of cotton or gauze, pieces wrung out of a\\r\\nweak solution, three per cent (three parts to one hundred of warm, boiled,\\r\\nwater) of boric acid. The eyes should not be exposed to the light. At the\\r\\nfirst both the eyes should be bathed and the same piece of linen should\\r\\nnot be used for both eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as any redness appears the eye should be frequently bathed with\\r\\nthis warm, weak solution of boric acid and sometimes cold compresses\\r\\nshould be used by taking squares of folded gauze or masses of absorbent\\r\\ncotton. Take them cold from a block of ice and lay them over the eyes, and\\r\\nkeep constantly changing to keep them cold. This relieves the congestion\\r\\nand prevents a great amount of blood from flowing and settling\\r\\n(congestion) there. When pus appears in the eye it should be cleansed\\r\\nevery half hour at least. You can do this by letting the solution run over\\r\\nit from a medicine dropper. After being allowed to trickle from the outer\\r\\nto the inner angle (corner) of the eye, it will then run down beside the\\r\\nnose and can be caught in a piece of  absorbent cotton or sponge. If there\\r\\nis a great amount of pus in the eye, the eye may have to be washed out in\\r\\nthis manner, every fifteen minutes, day and night, so that the cornea will\\r\\nbe kept clean. If this must be done a small fountain syringe with a glass\\r\\ntube (eye-dropper) attached will cause a steady flow of the solution. The\\r\\nboric acid can be increased to five or ten grains to the ounce of water.\\r\\nIf only one eye is diseased the other eye may be covered.\\r\\n\\r\\n[EYE AND EAR 351]\\r\\n\\r\\nAll cloths, etc., should be burned at once and the basin which has held\\r\\nthem, filled with carbolic acid solution of the strength of one part acid\\r\\nto twenty parts water. The nurse\\'s hands should be thoroughly scrubbed in\\r\\nhot water and soap and disinfected in the same strength of carbolic acid\\r\\nsolution, as the disease is very contagious and dangerous to adults. An\\r\\nattendant should not touch her face or hair with her hands unless they\\r\\nhave been washed quite clean. The conjunctiva should be brushed with a\\r\\nsolution of nitrate of silver of two per cent strength (two parts to one\\r\\nhundred of distilled water) and then neutralized with a salt solution, not\\r\\nstrong enough to burn.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the cornea is diseased one per cent solution of atropine may be\\r\\nnecessary once or twice a day.\\r\\n\\r\\nCaution.--In the cities this disease is disastrous in its results to the\\r\\nsight of babies. This is due to the want of necessary care. Persons who\\r\\nmust be with the patient should be very careful not to get any of the\\r\\ndischarge upon their clothes or person, as it is very contagious.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nULCER OF THE CORNEA.--Causes.--Poor general health is an underlying cause\\r\\nor the cornea itself may be poorly nourished. Ulcers are common among the\\r\\npoor classes. They often begin through a rubbing of the cornea by a\\r\\nforeign body. They also come from diseases of the conjunctiva. Weakly\\r\\nbabies are easily affected.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--The light hurts the patient; there is a feeling of something in\\r\\nthe eye. When the ulcer is over the pupil the sight is impaired. The\\r\\neyeball shows a ring of pink congestion about the cornea, with congestion\\r\\nof the conjunctiva. The form of the ulcer may be irregular, circular, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCourse.--The simple ulcers heal in a week or two. Infected ulcers may\\r\\nspread, or they may sink deeply into the substance of the cornea and eat\\r\\nthrough. The danger to the sight depends upon the kind and severity of the\\r\\nulcer. There is apt to be more or less film over the eye for some time and\\r\\nif the ulcer eats through it may destroy the sight.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment. Preventive.--When the cornea has been injured and there has\\r\\nbeen some rubbing off of its tissue (abrasion) mild antiseptic solution in\\r\\nthe form of eye drops should be used. Boric acid, as much as will dissolve\\r\\nin warm, distilled water and some dropped in the eye three or four times a\\r\\nday. If there is a foreign body in the cornea, clean instruments should be\\r\\nused to remove it. The cocaine used to render the eye painless must be\\r\\npure.\\r\\n\\r\\n[352 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral Treatment.--If the patient is \"run down\" the general system should\\r\\nbe built up.\\r\\n\\r\\nLocal Treatment.--One to two per cent solution of Atropine should be put\\r\\ninto the eye three to six times a day to keep the pupil dilated and\\r\\nprevent it from adhering to the cornea. Hot fomentations repeated\\r\\naccording to the severity of the case and the amount of \"easing\" they\\r\\ngive. A three per cent solution of boric acid should be used for cleansing\\r\\npurposes. The bowels should be regular. The patient should remain in one\\r\\nroom.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFILM ON THE EYE PTERYGIUM.--This is a growth beginning near the inner or\\r\\nouter corner and extending with its point towards the center of the\\r\\ncornea.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--The patient only complains when it has advanced toward the\\r\\ncenter of the cornea and the vision is lessened or cut off. It occurs more\\r\\noften from the inner corner. It keeps growing for many years and may cease\\r\\nadvancing at any time.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--Surgical treatment is often necessary. Dr. Alling says:\\r\\n\"Dissect off the growth from the cornea and sclera coats, leaving the base\\r\\nattached (toward the corner of the eye) and bury its point under the\\r\\nundermined conjunctiva below. If the growth is dissected off the cornea,\\r\\nwhich may readily be done, and then cut off (towards its base) it would\\r\\nrecur.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIRITIS. (Inflammation of the Iris.)--This is an inflammation of the iris,\\r\\ncharacterized by congestion, small pupil and posterior synechia.\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses.--It occurs in the second stage of syphilis, second to eighteenth\\r\\nmonth, from rheumatism, diabetes, gout, injury, and without any known\\r\\ncause (idiopathic).\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--More or less severe pain in the eye, forehead and temple, worse\\r\\nin the night and early morning especially. There is fear of the light and\\r\\nthe eyes water very much. The sight is affected and there may be some\\r\\nfever. On examination the lids are found swollen and red, the eyeball\\r\\nshows congestion in the cornea and ciliary body, with some congestion of\\r\\nthe conjunctiva. The cornea looks hazy. The anterior surface of the iris\\r\\nlooks muddy and does not look so fine and delicate. The pupil is small and\\r\\nthe light does not make it contract readily. If atropine is put in the eye\\r\\n(one per cent solution) the pupil will not dilate regularly, because at\\r\\ndifferent points the pupillary edge of the iris is held to the lens by an\\r\\nexudate that lightly holds it.\\r\\n\\r\\nCourse and Recovery.--The disease may occur at any age, but it is most\\r\\ncommon in children. It may last from one to six weeks.\\r\\n\\r\\nChances of recovery are good if treatment is begun early. There is a\\r\\ntendency to recurrence.\\r\\n\\r\\n[EYE AND EAR 353]\\r\\n\\r\\nMOTHER\\'S REMEDY.--1. Iritis.--Sensible Remedy for.--\"Doctor the blood with\\r\\nsulphur and lard, a teaspoonful three times a day. Refrain from using the\\r\\neyes. This disease is said to be brought on by rheumatic fever, and\\r\\nrheumatism is a disease of the blood.\" This is a very serious disease and\\r\\na physician should be called.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment. What to do first.--Confine the patient in a darkened room and\\r\\nif the attack is severe in bed.\\r\\n\\r\\nLocal Treatment.--Dry or moist heat should be applied, according to the\\r\\nease they give. Leeches are good in severe cases placed near the outer\\r\\ncorner of the eye. Atropine usually made of about the strength of two to\\r\\nfour grains Atropine to an ounce of water; or one per cent (1 to 100) may\\r\\nbe used, and it should be dropped into the eye from three to six times a\\r\\nday. The pupil must be dilated and kept so from the beginning to keep the\\r\\nadhesions from forming between the iris and lens. If too much is used the\\r\\nthroat and tongue will feel dry, face will flush, and there will be\\r\\ndizziness and a rapid pulse. Stop it until that effect is gone and then\\r\\ncautiously use it again. The bowels should be kept open.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe diet should consist of milk to a great extent. Water of course can be\\r\\ntaken freely. Soups, broths, gruels, etc., can be used if desired; but\\r\\nmeats should be withheld for a time unless the patient runs down.\\r\\n\\r\\nCaution.--If a person has any of the special symptoms above mentioned it\\r\\nwould be prudent to begin treatment at once. The great danger is permanent\\r\\nadhesion of the iris to other parts, especially the lens, and the dilating\\r\\nand contracting power may be lost.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nINJURIES OF THE IRIS.--Concussion of the eyeball may produce an irregular\\r\\ndilation of the pupil. This is due to paralysis of the sphincter muscle of\\r\\nthe pupil, but it generally disappears. The edge of the pupil may be torn\\r\\nin the form of one or more rents, or the iris may be separated from its\\r\\nroot at its circumference, leaving a clear space, or it may be entirely\\r\\ntorn from its attachment.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerforating wounds are accompanied by injury to the lens and other\\r\\nstructures; when the cornea is wounded it is often complicated by falling\\r\\nof the lens. When a small foreign body passes through the cornea and iris\\r\\na small opening may be seen. The greatest danger from wounds is due to\\r\\ninfection and if it reaches the iris, it may produce violent iritis. If\\r\\nthe lens is displaced or absent the iris being without support, will\\r\\ntremble with every movement of the eye. In some cataract operations, if\\r\\nthere is a loss of the \"Vitreous\" body a part of the iris may be folded\\r\\nupon itself, thus enlarging the pupil in that point.\\r\\n\\r\\n[354 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nCATARACT.--This is an opacity of the crystalline lens or its capsule. The\\r\\nlens is not clear and bright and keeps the light from going through it.\\r\\nThen it is called opaque.\\r\\n\\r\\nSENILE CATARACT.--The vast majority of these cataracts are found after the\\r\\nage of fifty. They simply come without any known cause. Of course, injury\\r\\ncan cause a cataract and it is then called traumatic cataract.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms of Senile (Old Age) Cataract.--Blurred vision, flashes and\\r\\nstreaks of light, dark spots, double vision. There is no pain. Eye strain\\r\\ndue to imperfect sight. Sometimes the first symptom is ability to read\\r\\nwithout glasses (second sight). This is due to the increased refractive\\r\\npower of the lens from swelling. The lens looks a little whitish through\\r\\nthe pupil opening and looks more so as time goes on.\\r\\n\\r\\nCourse.--The progress is slow. It usually takes a number of years before\\r\\nit is \"ripe\" for operation. They may remain in the same condition\\r\\nsometimes. In this kind of cataract both eyes are affected sooner or\\r\\nlater, although one eye may be fully matured before the other is much\\r\\nchanged.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe result of an operation depends upon the condition of the eye. The eye\\r\\nshould be free from evidence of disease. \"The anterior chamber should be\\r\\nof normal depth. The pupil should react to light. There should be a\\r\\nhomogeneous (all alike) white or gray opacity immediately back of the\\r\\npupil, with no shadow from the edge of the pupil (except in cases of\\r\\nsclerosis, already mentioned). A candle carried on all sides of the\\r\\npatient while the eye is fixed, should be properly located by him. The\\r\\ntension of the eyeball should be normal.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe operation is very frequently done and it is very successful. The\\r\\npatient should be ready and willing to place himself in the charge of the\\r\\noperator and do as he says.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSYMPATHETIC INFLAMMATION OF THE EYE.--(Sympathetic Ophthalmia.)--A\\r\\ncondition in which the healthy eye becomes the seat of a destructive\\r\\ninflammation transferred from the other eye which has been the subject of\\r\\na similar inflammation usually following a perforating injury of the\\r\\neyeball. The injured eye is called the exciting eye; the other, the\\r\\nsympathetic eye.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a rare disease, but it may occur when one eye is injured or\\r\\ndiseased and on the first indication of trouble in the injured eye the\\r\\nother eye should be closely watched for symptoms of sympathetic trouble so\\r\\nthat if can be removed.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms in the Exciting Eye.--This is more or less congested and painful;\\r\\nwhen pressure is made upon the upper lid, it shows tenderness. The tension\\r\\nis not as strong; the pupil may be blocked with an exudate.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Sympathizing Eye.--There is an inflammation involving the choroid,\\r\\nciliary body and iris. There is pain, tenderness, small blocked pupil and\\r\\nsight is poor.\\r\\n\\r\\n[EYE AND EAR 355]\\r\\n\\r\\nCourse.--It usually appears between the third week and the sixth month\\r\\nafter the original injury. \"The extreme limits are two weeks and twenty\\r\\nyears.\" The sound eye is likely to be attacked when the exciting eye is in\\r\\na state of active inflammation.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--The \"exciting eye\" should be enucleated (taken out) before any\\r\\nsigns of sympathetic inflammation appears in the healthy eye. If it has\\r\\nappeared, enucleation will be of no value; at all events if there is\\r\\nvision in the exciting eye, the operation should not be done then.\\r\\n\\r\\nINFLAMMATION OF THE RETINA FROM BRIGHT\\'S DISEASE (Albuminuric\\r\\nRetinitis).--The retina is a very delicate structure and we are often able\\r\\nto diagnose Bright\\'s disease from the peculiar effect it produces upon the\\r\\nretina.\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses.--The cause is usually Bright\\'s disease, (nephritis) and usually\\r\\nthe chronic Interstitial variety. Pregnancy causes it sometimes.\\r\\nInterference of the vision, sight, is what the patient complains of. This\\r\\nmay be very slight, when you consider the great changes occurring in the\\r\\nretina. Such patients are subject to attacks of temporary blindness of\\r\\nuremic origin. The vessels of the retina are swollen and tortuous.\\r\\nBleeding and shining white patches are scattered through the back part of\\r\\nthe eye and a peculiar arrangement of glistening white dots around the\\r\\nyellow spot. This disease shows itself late in Bright\\'s disease and the\\r\\npatient is not likely to live more than two years after the appearance of\\r\\nthis eye lesion.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--It sometimes occurs during pregnancy. Then the question of\\r\\ninducing premature labor arises. There is no local treatment that can be\\r\\nof any use when it is caused by Bright\\'s disease.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFITTING GLASSES.--This is done by lenses and prisms, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nLens.--A lens is made of glass and prisms graded in strength, one surface\\r\\ncurved, and has the power of refracting or changing the direction of the\\r\\nrays of light. A prism is wedge-shaped and bends rays of light towards its\\r\\nbase. A great many people are troubled with their eyes, much more than\\r\\nyears ago. We even see little children wearing glasses. It is unfortunate,\\r\\nbut true, that even more children and grown people should wear them.\\r\\nFitting glasses is an art in itself. It takes more ability to fit glasses\\r\\nwell than it does to operate well. Poorly-fitted glasses are not only\\r\\nannoying to the wearer, but dangerous. Glasses rest the eyes, not tire\\r\\nthem. When the eyes water and feel tired or strained, even after using\\r\\nthem but little, glasses are needed. Headaches are frequently caused by\\r\\nthe eye strain. When glasses are needed it does not pay to put off getting\\r\\nthem and the person needing them should go to one competent to properly\\r\\nfit them. A great many eyes are hard to fit, and they need not only\\r\\nability to fit them well, but time and attention must be given to fitting\\r\\nthem properly.\\r\\n\\r\\n[356 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nSQUINT OR STRABISMUS.--Both lines of sight are not directed towards the\\r\\nsame object of fixation.\\r\\n\\r\\nInternal or Convergent Squint.--Where one eye is turned inward toward the\\r\\nnose.\\r\\n\\r\\nExternal or Divergent Squint.--One eye turns outward toward the temple.\\r\\nSquinting upward and downward are uncommon.\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses of Convergent (Internal) Squint.--It generally appears between two\\r\\nand five years; at first periodically, later constantly. The patient is\\r\\ngenerally far-sighted.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--Internal squint in very young children may be treated by\\r\\ncovering the well eye and forcing the child to use the other. When the\\r\\nchild is old enough, proper glasses should be worn. Operation can be done\\r\\nwhen needed and is generally successful.\\r\\n\\r\\nExternal (Divergent) Squint.--This may appear at any age and is often\\r\\nassociated with near-sightedness. An operation is necessary and the\\r\\ntendons on both sides must generally be cut and properly placed. Parents\\r\\nshould always attend to a child who has this trouble. The operation is not\\r\\ndifficult to perform and it will not only, as a rule, give the child good\\r\\nsight, but better looks. Parents who are able to have an operation or\\r\\nglasses fitted when needed, and who neglect their children, should be\\r\\npunished; they are guilty not only of neglect, but cruelty.\\r\\n\\r\\nMOTHERS\\' REMEDIES.

Inflammation of Eyes, Wild Hairs Cause.--\"A few years ago, I had\\r\\ntrouble with my eyes. They felt as though there was something in them\\r\\nscratching the eye-ball. I went to an eye specialist, and he gave me two\\r\\nlittle vials of medicine to drop into my eyes six times a day. I doctored\\r\\nwith him several months, and while the medicine reduced the inflammation\\r\\nlargely, it did not relieve the scratching sensation in the eyes. Then I\\r\\nwas away from home for about ten days and did not use the medicine, and\\r\\nwhen I returned my eyes were very much inflamed, and very painful. I\\r\\nvisited the doctor again, and he said I had a little ulcer on the eyeball,\\r\\nand he pulled out several hairs or winkers from the eyelid. I asked him if\\r\\nwild hairs were the cause of the ulcer and he admitted they were. After a\\r\\nfew days\\' more treatment by the doctor I learned of a neighbor who\\r\\nunderstood a little about wild hairs in the eyelid and had him examine my\\r\\neyes. He pulled out more wild hairs, and my eyes got well. Ever since\\r\\nthen, when my eyes begin to hurt me as though there was some foreign\\r\\nsubstance in them, I go to my neighbor and he pulls out the wild hairs,\\r\\nand that was the trouble with my eyes. My experience in obtaining this\\r\\nknowledge cost me twenty dollars in fees to the eye specialist, which I\\r\\ncould have saved by going to my neighbor at first,\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMOTHERS\\' REMEDIES.--Sore Eyes. 1.

It is an oval funnel-shaped\\r\\norgan. The canal leading in to the membrane (drum) is called the external\\r\\nauditory meatus. It extends inward about one and one-quarter inches and\\r\\nterminates in a membrane.\\r\\n\\r\\nMembrane Tympani (drum) which separates the external ear from the tympanic\\r\\ncavity. To examine the drum, you must pull the ear backward and outward to\\r\\nmake the canal straight.\\r\\n\\r\\nMembrane Tympani (the drum) Membrane.--This is situated at the inner end\\r\\nof the canal and separates it from the tympanum or middle ear. It is\\r\\nplaced like the membrane in the telephone. It is pearly gray in color.\\r\\nThis membrane not only serves as a protection to the delicate structures\\r\\nwithin the tympanum, but also receives the sound vibrations from without\\r\\nand transmits them to the ossicular (bony) chain of the middle ear.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Tympanum or Middle Ear.--This cavity just beyond the drum, which forms\\r\\nthe greater part of its outer wall, is an irregular cavity, compressed\\r\\nfrom without inward and situated in the petrous bone. The mastoid cells\\r\\nlie behind. It is filled with air and communicates with the nose-pharynx\\r\\n(naso-pharynx) by the eustachian tube. The upper portion of this cavity,\\r\\nthe attic, lies immediately below the middle lobe of the brain, separated\\r\\nfrom it by a thin layer of bone, which forms the roof of the cavity. This\\r\\ncavity is separated from the internal ear.\\r\\n\\r\\n[EYE AND EAR 359]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Eustachian tube.--This is the channel through which the middle ear\\r\\ncommunicates with the pharynx. With an opening in the anterior of the\\r\\nmiddle ear, a bony canal passes from this point, inward, forward, and\\r\\ndownward through the petrous bone, when it merges into a cartilaginous\\r\\ncanal, which terminates in a funnel-shaped protuberance, with a slit-like\\r\\norifice, located in the nose pharynx. This is the eustachian tube. It is\\r\\nlined with mucous membrane like the throat. The air goes up from the\\r\\nthroat, through this canal to the middle ear. The mucous membrane of the\\r\\nmiddle ear is continuous with that of the nose-pharynx through the\\r\\neustachian tube. So you can readily understand how easy it is for an\\r\\ninflammation of the throat to extend to the middle ear through the\\r\\neustachian tube.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe posterior wall which has the greatest height, reveals in its upper\\r\\nportion a passage (antrum) through which the vault of the tympanum (attic)\\r\\ncommunicates with the cells of the mastoid process, situated posteriorly.\\r\\nFrom this description you see how near to each other these parts are\\r\\nplaced and when one becomes diseased the disease can extend to the other\\r\\npart or parts. The brain is separated from some of these cavities by a\\r\\nvery thin shell of bone, and the disease can soon affect the brain through\\r\\ninfection or breaking through the thin structures that separates the\\r\\nparts.\\r\\n\\r\\nDiseases of the middle ear and the mastoid are always to be considered\\r\\nserious, and should be very closely watched. A child with a running ear is\\r\\nin danger, for it may at any time become closed up and serious.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nECZEMA OF THE EXTERNAL EAR (Auricle).--This is an inflammatory disease of\\r\\nthe skin, and in the poorer classes it is very frequent. It is quite a\\r\\ncommon disease in old age. It develops in other parts of the body at the\\r\\nsame time in a certain percentage of cases.\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses.--Soaps, alkalies, foreign bodies in the ear, removing ear wax and\\r\\na chronic discharge from the middle ear. There is a tendency to it in some\\r\\nfamilies; stomach trouble, improper food are also causes.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--Itching,--and this is very pronounced,--burning feeling. The\\r\\npart is somewhat reddened, fluid oozes out, crusts form, the skin\\r\\nthickens, and scales. Sometimes it swells very much.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--Regulate the bowels, give a simple easily digested and proper\\r\\nfood for children and adults. Cleanse the inflamed skin gently with\\r\\ncastile soap and tepid water once a day. Cloths dipped in some cooling\\r\\nlotion, such as the lead and opium wash, or in plain water to which has\\r\\nbeen added a little alcohol or eau de cologne, should be wrapped around\\r\\nthe inflamed ear during the acute stage and they should be kept wet. Clean\\r\\nvaselin, etc., is good to put on the scabs. The ear should be covered as\\r\\nbefore directed to keep dirt, dust, etc., out.\\r\\n\\r\\n[360 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHARDENED WAX OR IMPACTED CERUMEN.--This mass may be mixed with foreign\\r\\nbodies or be made up of \"wax\" alone.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--A large mass of wax may remain in the ear for many years\\r\\nwithout causing any special loss of hearing so long as the plug does not\\r\\nrest against the drum and there remains a passage between the mass so that\\r\\nthe sound-waves can strike the drum. Generally the hearing gradually grows\\r\\nless. Loss of hearing may take place suddenly, as after washing the head,\\r\\nor after a general bath, or after an attempt to clean the ear with the end\\r\\nof a towel. Patients will often say the dullness of hearing appeared\\r\\nsuddenly. This no doubt was due to the fact that the mass of wax was\\r\\ndisplaced against the drum suddenly by an unusual movement of the head or\\r\\nthe jaws, or the mass became swollen through fluids getting into the\\r\\ncanal. If the canal is filled there will be more or less deafness, ringing\\r\\nin the ear, and there may be piercing pain produced by the hardened mass,\\r\\nespecially if the jaws are moved from side to side. If the mass is\\r\\nthoroughly and carefully removed, the hearing may entirely return if it\\r\\nwas caused by this wax.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--The mass is best removed by syringing the hardened plug and\\r\\nsoftening it gradually. Removing it with a currette and forceps without\\r\\nsoftening it may do injury to the parts. The syringe and hot sterilized,\\r\\nboiled water should be used for some time, and the patient asked\\r\\noccasionally if there is any faintness or dizziness caused by it. It often\\r\\ncomes, in a lump after the water has been used for some time. A strong\\r\\nsolution of bicarbonate of sodium is also good to use.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFOREIGN BODIES IN THE EAR.--These are not of frequent occurrence. In the\\r\\ncase of children these bodies may comprise such objects as pebbles, beads,\\r\\nbeans, pieces of rolled paper, fly, bed-bug; insect of any kind may get\\r\\ninto ear of adults. If they reach the drum a very unpleasant sensation is\\r\\nproduced by the attempt to escape. Sometimes a layer of wax may gather\\r\\naround the dead object. These bodies should be removed, for their presence\\r\\nmay produce a swelling or soreness in the canal. If the object is a dried\\r\\npea or bean the syringe should not be used. The object must be carefully\\r\\nremoved. Sometimes an operation is necessary to remove the object.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDISEASE OF THE MIDDLE EAR.--The ordinary cold in the head rarely runs its\\r\\ncourse without one of the eustachian tubes at least is involved to some\\r\\nextent.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSIMPLE INFLAMMATION OF THE EUSTACHIAN TUBE.--Causes.--Acute colds,\\r\\ninflammation of the nose and pharynx, tonsilitis.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--The ear may feel full and numb, roaring in the ear may occur.\\r\\nThere may be pain on swallowing, shooting up through the tube.\\r\\n\\r\\n[EYE AND EAR 361]\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--Remove the cause. Treat the nose and pharynx. Spray and gargle\\r\\nwith solutions advised for throat trouble. If it continues the throat\\r\\nshould be examined for adenoids, enlarged turbinate bones and so on.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nACUTE CATARRHAL INFLAMMATION OF THE MIDDLE EAR. Causes.--Acute coryza,\\r\\nacute pharyngitis, influenza, scarlet fever, inflammation of the\\r\\neustachian tube, gargling, bathing, employing the nasal douche or\\r\\nviolently blowing the nose.\\r\\n\\r\\nInflammation of the eustachian tube is, in many cases, simply the first\\r\\nstage or onset of this disease. The congestion extends beyond the tube and\\r\\ninvolves to a greater or less degree this cavity. If it continues for a\\r\\nfew hours or an entire day, the watery elements of the blood will begin to\\r\\nescape from the distended vessels into the tissues of the mucous membrane\\r\\nand ooze out upon its free surface. If this is copious enough pressure may\\r\\nbe developed within the cavity, middle-ear, to cause pain. These cases\\r\\nvary much in severity. In the mildest ones there may be a few twinges of\\r\\npain in the affected ear, but nothing more; and even in the most severe\\r\\ncases the pain does not last longer than a few hours, although it may\\r\\nreturn on several successive days. Very many of the earaches of young\\r\\nchildren, from two to ten years of age, are due to this disease. The pain\\r\\nis very likely to come on late in the afternoon or during the night, while\\r\\nearlier in the day the child may be free from pain. In the milder forms\\r\\nthe condition of the drum is similar to that existing in inflammation of\\r\\nthe eustachian tube. It is not then much changed from normal. There may be\\r\\nmore congestion than in this condition. In a fairly severe case the\\r\\nmembrane (drum) a few hours after the onset presents a most striking\\r\\nchange. It is a picture of obstructed venous (dark blood) circulation of a\\r\\nhigh degree. In some cases one or more of these distended veins may\\r\\nrupture and form a blood tumor in the external ear canal. The drum is red\\r\\nand more or less swollen.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--Very little is needed for this kind, except care and watching.\\r\\nUse the simple hot water in the ear carefully or poulticing when there is\\r\\npain with onions, bread and milk, and puncture of the drum if it bulges or\\r\\nis too tense. Hot water for gargle, steaming of the pharynx. Keep the\\r\\npatient in a room with an even temperature. The patient must not take cold\\r\\nas it might extend farther.\\r\\n\\r\\nRecovery.--The outcome is usually good in this disease if proper care is\\r\\ntaken; Generally in a few weeks the inflammation is gone and the hearing\\r\\nis restored.\\r\\n\\r\\n[362 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nSEROUS MUCOUS EXUDATION INTO THE MIDDLE EAR.--The disease just described\\r\\nis often associated with an (exudation) watery oozing of fluid into the\\r\\nmiddle ear, but the following condition is different. Sometimes a\\r\\ncomparatively normal middle ear is found to contain a variable amount of\\r\\neither fluid or mucus, or a fluid which represents a combination of both.\\r\\nThe failure of the fluid to absorb is due first to the fact that the\\r\\ndrainage through the eustachian tube is still obstructed; second, that the\\r\\nabsorbing process in the cavity is not acting normally.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptom.--Sudden change from somewhat poor to good hearing and the\\r\\nreverse. It is due to the changing in the position of the fluid. The\\r\\nhearing may be normal when the head is thrown far backward, for the fluid\\r\\nthen escapes into the antrum, or when the chin is resting upon the chest.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother symptom that is peculiar is a feeling of something moving in the\\r\\near. This is only felt when the head is moved suddenly. Sometimes the\\r\\npatient says: \"I went in bathing and got some water into my ear, and I am\\r\\nunable to get it out.\" He thinks the water went into the ear by the way of\\r\\nthe external ear canal. It was due to the chilling of the surface of the\\r\\nbody, or the water accidentally entered into the ear through the mouth, or\\r\\nnose, throat, and eustachian tube, and this caused an exudation of fluid\\r\\nto take place in the middle ear. Hearing gurgling sounds in the ear during\\r\\ncoughing, sneezing and swallowing is an important symptom. The drum on\\r\\nbeing examined varies greatly. The simplest case is seen when fluid\\r\\ncontained in the cavity is small in quantity and consists of a thin serum.\\r\\nThe upper level of this fluid can then be seen like a hair crossing the\\r\\ndrum in a more or less horizontal direction. It retains its horizontal\\r\\nposition when the patient moves his head backward and forward.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--The fluid can be evacuated by an opening made into the drum,\\r\\nbut it usually accumulates again. The proper treatment is to treat the\\r\\ndiseased condition of the nose and throat, as described in other parts of\\r\\nthis book.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHRONIC CATARRHAL INFLAMMATION OF THE MIDDLE EAR.--The expression, acute\\r\\ninflammation of the middle ear, is rightly employed when it is applied to\\r\\na case in which the underlying cause is of a temporary nature, as for\\r\\nexample, a cold in the head, and mild attack of influenza, perhaps also in\\r\\nan attack of hay fever. But when the causes are of a more permanent\\r\\ncharacter and the middle ear continues for an indefinite period to be the\\r\\nseat of all sorts of disturbances the combination of these different\\r\\ndiseased phenomena receives the name of chronic catarrhal inflammation of\\r\\nthe middle ear.\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses.--Troubles (lesions) located in the upper pharynx, the\\r\\nnaso-pharyngeal (nose-pharynx) vault and the nasal passages. Adenoids may\\r\\ncause it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe course of this disease has of recent years been growing more\\r\\nfavorable, because the causes are being removed more and more.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--Symptoms of the acute inflammation would be present, and\\r\\nimpairment of hearing which sometimes comes so gradually as not to be\\r\\nnoticed by the patient. It will be better and then worse. A harassing,\\r\\nhissing, blowing, ringing, usually accompanies it. Pains soon or later add\\r\\nto the discomfort. One side is usually affected first.\\r\\n\\r\\n[EYE AND EAR 363]\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--It must be devoted to removing the causes just mentioned.\\r\\nRestore the general health. Abstain from alcohol, tobacco and excess of\\r\\nall kinds. Active outdoor exercise, horseback riding, mountain climbing,\\r\\nrowing, walking, etc., are great health producers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nACUTE SUPPURATIVE INFLAMMATION OF THE MIDDLE EAR.--This inflammation of\\r\\nthe middle ear is one in which, at an early stage of the disease, the free\\r\\nliquid poured out assumes a pus-like character. At the onset the mucous\\r\\nmembrane of the eustachian tube and middle ear becomes first congested and\\r\\nafterward oedematous (watery swelling). Then a serous or a bloody-serous\\r\\nfluid is poured out into the middle ear; and finally this assumes all the\\r\\noutward characteristics of pus. In a few exceptional cases this pus fluid\\r\\nwill find a sufficient passage through the eustachian tube; but in the\\r\\ngreat majority of cases this passageway becomes closed almost at the very\\r\\nbeginning of the attack, and then the free exudation; under an ever\\r\\nincreasing pressure and on account of the softening and breaking down of\\r\\nthe tissues of the drum forces an opening for itself directly through the\\r\\ndrum membrane.\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses.--The same causes that produce the acute variety will produce this\\r\\nvariety of the disease. It occurs more frequently during the spring and\\r\\nfall months as the result of changes in the climate. Acute and chronic\\r\\ncatarrh of the nose and pharynx are causes. It frequently occurs in\\r\\nconnection with scarlet fever and measles. It complicates nose and\\r\\npharyngeal diphtheria.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--Pain in the ear is the most striking symptom noticed by the\\r\\npatient. In infants and young children of two or three years of age it may\\r\\nappear and not be recognized until a slight discharge appears at the\\r\\nopening of the external ear. The child is feverish, fretful and peevish,\\r\\nseemingly suffering great pain, and the parents think it is, not very sick\\r\\nor has only an earache. Sometimes physicians fail to recognize the trouble\\r\\nuntil the discharge appears in the external ear. The symptoms are more\\r\\nsevere at night. Any physical or mental exertion increases the plain. The\\r\\npain is sometimes very severe, and a spontaneous or artificial rupture of\\r\\nthe drum eases the suffering very quickly in some cases, and a bloody,\\r\\nserous, pus-like discharge escapes into the external ear canal. Often a\\r\\npatient will say: \"I felt something give away in the ear, a watery\\r\\ndischarge appeared, and the pain soon subsided.\" In many cases the rupture\\r\\nof the drum gives little or no relief from suffering. This is due in some\\r\\ncases to the small and insufficient size of the opening in the drum. If\\r\\nthe pain persists, after a free opening has been made, it may indicate\\r\\nthat pressure exists in some cavity or cavities other than the middle ear\\r\\nproper. A sensation of fullness and sometimes of throbbing or pulsation in\\r\\nthe affected ear; roaring, singing, whistling, etc.; impairment of\\r\\nhearing; increased pain, when the jaws are opened and shut, are symptoms\\r\\nof minor importance. If there are no complications after free discharge\\r\\nsets in the pain disappears, the fever gradually returns to the normal\\r\\npoint, and the patient drops to sleep. In the course of a week or two the\\r\\ndischarge subsides and if the rupture is not too extensive the wound will\\r\\nclose and the patient will soon be well. Frequently, however, on account\\r\\nof disease of one or more of the bony parts, the wall of the middle ear or\\r\\nthe mastoid cells, the discharge continues for weeks and may become\\r\\nchronic in its character.\\r\\n\\r\\n[364 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES ]\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--Apply heat or cold first. Open the bowels.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow to apply heat.--With the patient lying on his side with the affected\\r\\near turned upward, fill the external ear canal with hot water (about 105\\r\\ndegrees F.), then place immediately over the affected ear a hot flaxseed\\r\\nmeal poultice, five or six inches square and one-half inch thick, and\\r\\nspread a folded blanket or shawl over the whole to keep it warm as long as\\r\\npossible. Bread and milk with catnip, or onions will do if flaxseed is not\\r\\nat hand. The flaxseed holds the heat longer. Water is a good conductor of\\r\\nheat, and that which fills the external auditory (ear) canal may rightly\\r\\nbe considered as an arm of the poultice which extends down to the drum\\r\\nitself.\\r\\n\\r\\nLeeches also can be applied in front and below the tragus (front of the\\r\\nopening). If the symptoms do not improve under this treatment and\\r\\nespecially if the drum is bulging, an opening should be made at the\\r\\nbulging point of the drum. The canal is now syringed with a warm\\r\\nantiseptic solution--like one part listerine, etc., to twenty parts of\\r\\nwarm boiled water, with a clean syringe, or warm boiled water can be used\\r\\nalone. If there is any odor carbolic acid one part, to fifty or sixty of\\r\\nwater can be used. A strip of sterile gauze is put into the canal for\\r\\ndrainage and protection. This syringing can be done from two to four to\\r\\nfive times a day, and gradually decrease the number of times as the\\r\\ndischarge lessens. It must be syringed and dressed often enough to allow a\\r\\nfree discharge and produce cleanliness.\\r\\n\\r\\nRecovery.--The result of this disease cannot be told at the outset. The\\r\\nmajority of such attacks end favorably, with care and treatment; this in\\r\\npersons of good constitution and health. It may run ten days to three to\\r\\nsix weeks. In tuberculous patients the result is not so favorable.\\r\\nRecovery follows as a rule in this disease following scarlet fever and\\r\\nmeasles, but not so quickly, and there may be a discharge for some time,\\r\\ndue to chronic disease of the ears, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nComplications and results.--In the majority of cases, in ordinarily\\r\\nhealthy persons, this disease runs its course without doing any great\\r\\namount of damage to the organ of hearing, and without involving any\\r\\nstructure lying outside of the middle ear proper. In scarlet fever,\\r\\nmeasles, la grippe, or nasal diphtheria, actual destruction of tissue\\r\\noften takes place in some part of the middle ear before it is recognized.\\r\\nSometimes it results the same way even when it is discovered in time.\\r\\n\\r\\nCaution.--A person who has had this disease should be very careful not to\\r\\ntake cold. The patient should take plenty of time to get well and strong.\\r\\nThe diet should be liquid mostly.\\r\\n\\r\\n[EYE AND EAR 365]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHRONIC SUPPURATIVE INFLAMMATION OF THE MIDDLE EAR.--An inflammation that\\r\\nforms pus; hence called suppurative. This is an inflammation that has\\r\\nbecome chronic (continued) and has one characteristic at least that is\\r\\nvery noticeable, and that is the discharge. This may last for an\\r\\nindefinite period. The acute suppurative (pus-forming) inflammation just\\r\\ndescribed in the foregoing pages, may have inflicted various kinds and\\r\\ndegrees of damage upon the mucous membrane which lines the cavities, and\\r\\nas a result of the conditions thus established there will be a discharge\\r\\nwhich may last an indefinite time.\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses.--Improper or lack of treatment for the acute suppurative\\r\\ninflammatory attack. This is the chief cause. The first attack may have\\r\\nbeen caused by scarlet fever, measles, etc. They are prone to become\\r\\nchronic, especially if not recognized early and treated properly.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--The main symptom is the discharge from the ear. This may be\\r\\nabundant or scanty. It may stop for a time and begin again. The hearing\\r\\nmay be slightly or seriously impaired. Such patients are not accepted by\\r\\nlife insurance companies.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--Cleanliness of the parts and perfect drainage must be secured.\\r\\nSyringing with one to fifty carbolic acid solution (acid one part, warm\\r\\nwater fifty parts) is good treatment. The opening in the drum should be\\r\\nmade large enough to give free discharge to the pus in the middle ear.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe patient\\'s strength must be built up if necessary.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nINFLAMMATION OF THE MASTOID\\' CELLS. (Acute or Chronic Mastoiditis).--This\\r\\ndisease represents one of the most serious terminations of an acute or a\\r\\nchronic suppurative inflammation of the middle ear. This is fortunately a\\r\\ncomparatively rare event. There are, however, quite a good many cases of\\r\\nthis terrible disease.\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses.--It occurs as a primary or secondary disease. The first condition\\r\\nis rare and the result from injury, exposure to cold and dampness, or from\\r\\nsyphilis or tuberculosis. Secondary disease is catarrhal or pus-like in\\r\\nform. This results from an extension of middle ear disease through the\\r\\nantrum, as a rule. The disease may develop at any time and endanger the\\r\\nlife of the sufferer.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--Dull constant pain behind the ear and tenderness on pressure,\\r\\nmore severe at night, the tenderness is very apt to be followed in a short\\r\\ntime by redness and swelling of the skin in the same region. The pus may\\r\\ndrain from the mastoid into the middle ear cavity. If this does not happen\\r\\nit may swell behind the ear and break through some other place. It may\\r\\ninvolve the structures within the brain. If meningitis develops, the\\r\\npatient has headache and later it becomes very severe. Lights hurts the\\r\\neyes, The patient is restless, sleepless, may have nausea and vomiting and\\r\\na constant high temperature. The neck is stiff and rigid. If there is more\\r\\nbrain involvement (phlebitis) there will be sudden rise of temperature,\\r\\nfollowed by a rapid fall of temperature and attended by profuse sweating\\r\\nand chills,--a dangerous condition. There can be abscess of the brain\\r\\nalso. In abscess of the brain symptoms are less severe and localized; the\\r\\nrigid neck and fear of light and vomiting are absent.\\r\\n\\r\\n[366 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES ]\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--If seen early it may be aborted. If an examination of the drum\\r\\nshows bulging, an incision of the drum head should be made. If an opening\\r\\nis there it should be enlarged, if necessary. Cold applications are\\r\\nvaluable and should be applied directly over the mastoid behind the ear.\\r\\nSometimes hot applications are better, hot poultices, cloths, etc.,\\r\\nsyringing the canal with hot water. These applications, etc., should be\\r\\nconstantly used for a day or, so, unless unfavorable symptoms set in, when\\r\\nif a marked improvement, especially in the local tenderness and pain, has\\r\\nnot occurred, an operation should be done and the mastoid opened.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe diet should be liquid (milk), nourishing and sustaining. Bowels should\\r\\nbe kept open.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis disease must be carefully watched. It is not only dangerous to life,\\r\\nand very quickly, but it is full of disagreeable and dangerous\\r\\npossibilities, lifelong discharge from the ear, an external fistulous\\r\\nopening, a permanent paralysis of the facial nerve, abscess in the brain.\\r\\nBrain symptoms, paralysis and pus symptoms do not now preclude an\\r\\noperation on the mastoid for mastoid disease. The patient should be\\r\\nclosely watched and an operation performed as soon as called for.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have given a longer description of the diseases of the ear than I\\r\\nintended when I began this part of the work. Diseases of the ear are\\r\\nbecoming quite frequent, and the subject is important. I did not give much\\r\\ngeneral medical treatment because I consider the local treatment is of\\r\\nmore importance in a work of this kind. In treating the baby, I shall give\\r\\nmore medical treatment. I shall treat the disease also, especially in\\r\\nrelation to the baby. There can be more local applications used than those\\r\\ngiven. If the hot treatment is thought best, not only hot water and\\r\\npoultices of many kinds can be used, but fomentations of hops, etc., and\\r\\nhot water cloths alone. The intent of such treatment is to keep hot moist\\r\\napplications to the part continually. The use of laudanum in poultices\\r\\nused for ear trouble is not recommended because its soothing power may\\r\\nobscure symptoms that might appear and be dangerous in themselves and need\\r\\nquick and thorough treatment. The syringing of hot water into the external\\r\\ncanal is often of great help. Five to ten grains of boric acid can be used\\r\\nin an ounce of water. If there is much odor to the discharge, you can use\\r\\none part of carbolic acid to fifty parts of boiled water. The water should\\r\\nnot be used too hot. One teaspoonful of the acid to fifty teaspoonfuls of\\r\\nwater, or that proportion. After using the hot water, the canal should be\\r\\nfilled with gauze for protection and drainage. For the fever, the first\\r\\ntwenty-four hours, one-tenth to one drop of aconite can be used every one\\r\\nto three hours. By putting one drop in ten teaspoonfuls of water you get\\r\\none-tenth of a drop at a dose.\\r\\n\\r\\n[EYE AND EAR 367]\\r\\n\\r\\nDEAFNESS.--This is usually the result of a disease and is merely a\\r\\nsymptom. Diseases of the middle ear, rupture of the drum membrane, and\\r\\nlarge ulceration of this membrane cause it. Ear wax causes temporary\\r\\ndeafness. Diseases of the throat and nose cause it very often, and\\r\\ndeafness frequently accompanies catarrh of the nose. Adenoids cause it\\r\\nsometimes, especially in children.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--The only way to prevent this trouble is to treat the disease\\r\\nthat causes it. Discharge from the ear, due to ear disease should be\\r\\ntreated from the first or it may cause permanent deafness in that ear.\\r\\nMany cases of scarlet fever leave deafness behind in one ear at least.\\r\\nThis trouble should be closely watched during an attack of scarlet fever,\\r\\nand in other infectious diseases and proper treatment given.\\r\\n\\r\\nChronic deafness is hard to cure; so often some of the deeper parts of the\\r\\near are diseased. When a person recognizes that his hearing is growing\\r\\nless acute he should have his ear examined. People often let the trouble\\r\\ngo too long before beginning treatment.\\r\\n\\r\\nMOTHERS\\' REMEDIES. Deafness. 1. Quick and Effective Remedy for.--\"Five or\\r\\nten drops of onion juice put in the ear several times a day is very good.\\r\\nIf there is any pain in the ear, add a drop or two of laudanum, or you may\\r\\njust use two or three drops of glycerin with the other ingredients. In\\r\\nabout an hour after treating the ear in this manner, syringe it well with\\r\\nwarm castile soap suds or warm milk.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Deafness. Often Tried Remedy for.--\"Take one dram each of tincture of\\r\\nlobelia, tincture of gum myrrh, oil of sassafras, tincture of opium and\\r\\nolive oil, mix and apply lint wet with the liniment in the ear, night, and\\r\\nmorning, then syringe out with warm water and castile soap.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Deafness, My Mother, in Galt, Found Mullein Good for.--\"Small blossoms\\r\\nof mullein, fill bottles and cork, hang in sun till oil forms, drop three\\r\\ndrops every third day in the ear for three or four weeks. We tried this\\r\\nsuccessfully in our family.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEARACHE.--The general belief exists that earache is something which is\\r\\nquite harmless and entirely different from a genuine inflammation of the\\r\\near. This belief is strengthened by the fact that the great majority of\\r\\nearaches subside without inflicting any harm upon the ear. As soon as a\\r\\ndischarge appears, in many cases, there is relief. If a discharge appears,\\r\\nthe earache was the result of an inflammation in the ear. So-called\\r\\nearache lasts but a short time, and can be relieved by either hot or cold\\r\\napplications; but when the earache continues for a day or more it is an\\r\\nindication of more than pain in the ear and if a thorough examination is\\r\\nmade there will, no doubt, be found disease of the ear that is causing the\\r\\nearache. Then the disease proper should be treated.\\r\\n\\r\\n[368 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--Hot or cold applications are of benefit. With the patient\\r\\nlying upon the well ear, fill the canal with hot water (105 degrees F.).\\r\\nThen place over the ear a flaxseed poultice or a roasted onion poultice,\\r\\nfour to five inches square and one-half inch thick and spread over all a\\r\\nfolded shawl. Bread and milk makes a good poultice also. A hot bran bag or\\r\\na hot salt bag is good. The heat must be continuous.\\r\\n\\r\\nMOTHERS\\' REMEDIES. 1. Earache, Hot Raisin for.--\"Hot raisins sometimes\\r\\nrelieve earache. Soak them in hot milk and change frequently.\" This is an\\r\\nexcellent remedy. The raisins should be placed in the ear canal, and they\\r\\nare sure to give relief.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Earache, Flax and Cornmeal for.--\"Flaxseed and cornmeal in oil.\" Take\\r\\nequal parts of flaxseed and cornmeal and mix together, then add enough\\r\\nsweet oil to moisten this mixture. This should be applied hot and kept so\\r\\nby repeating as each poultice is cold. This will be found very beneficial.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Earache, Soothing Home Remedy for.--\"Glycerin and laudanum heated and\\r\\ndropped in the ear. Hot poultice of hops inclosed in cotton bag and\\r\\napplied to the ear is very soothing.\" The glycerin and laudanum will give\\r\\ntemporary relief and the hops poultice retains the heat, which is one of\\r\\nthe essential things in earache.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Earache, Horse-radish Leaves for.--\"Steaming the face and ear with\\r\\ncrushed horseradish leaves will give relief and soothes one to sleep.\"\\r\\nWhen through steaming the face the horseradish leaves should be applied to\\r\\nthe face and ear as a poultice. This is very soothing.\\r\\n\\r\\n5. Earache, Onion Sure Cure for.--\"The heart of an onion.\" Roast the\\r\\nheart of an onion and put in the canal of the ear. Then apply heat to the\\r\\noutside of the ear and relief will soon be obtained.\\r\\n\\r\\n6. Earache; Temporary Relief for.--\\r\\n\\r\\n    \"Gum Camphor   1/2 dram\\r\\n    Olive Oil      1/2 ounce\\r\\n    Glycerin       1/2 ounce\\r\\n\\r\\nMix and drop in ear.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is good to relieve, but should not be continued, as this oily\\r\\nsubstance lodges in the ear and may cause trouble.\\r\\n\\r\\n7. Earache, Sweet Oil and Pepper for.--\"Take a piece of cotton batting,\\r\\ncover with sweet oil, then cover that with black pepper, inserting into\\r\\near.\" This is a good remedy.\\r\\n\\r\\n8. Earache, Steaming With Hot Water for.--\"Steam the ear and side of the\\r\\nhead with cloths wrung out of hot water; put feet in hot mustard water; do\\r\\nnot put anything in the ear but keep steaming it and you will find relief\\r\\nin a few hours, even if it is a gathering.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustraion: SKELETON.]\\r\\n\\r\\n[DEFORMITIES 369]\\r\\n\\r\\n9. Earache, Castor Oil for.--\"Put a drop of castor oil in the ear. Fill\\r\\nhot water bag and warm the ear that aches.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n10. Earache, Fresh Warm Milk for.--\"The warm milk from a cow will cure\\r\\nearache and has also been known to cure deafness.\" While still warm from\\r\\nthe cow drop a little in the ear.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDEFORMITIES.\\r\\n\\r\\nHARE-LIP.--This is due to the fact that the flesh or bony parts do not\\r\\nquite properly unite. It may form a single or double hare-lip, or\\r\\ncomplicated, or it may involve the soft parts, or the hard (bony) and soft\\r\\nparts at the same time. It is always to one or the other side of the\\r\\nmiddle line. It is double hair-lip in about one-tenth of the cases, and\\r\\nwhen double it is frequently complicated with cleft palate.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--Upon examination you notice that there is a split in the lip,\\r\\neither partly through the lip or entirely, so that the bone is exposed; or\\r\\nthe slit goes not only through the lip, but also through the bone.\\r\\n\\r\\nOperation.--This is necessary, and it is quite successful. The best time\\r\\nis between the third and sixth month, especially when it is a simple case.\\r\\nIn some cases of double hair-lip, when the child cannot take the breast\\r\\nand has to be fed, early operation should be done if the child is strong.\\r\\nThe operation for a simple hare-lip is very easily and quickly done. For\\r\\ncomplicated cases it takes longer, and of course is not without some\\r\\ndanger. It should be done, for a child is a pitiable sight with this\\r\\ndeformity. When grown up it is a source of great annoyance and shame.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCLEFT PALATE.--The bones that form the hard palate do not unite in the\\r\\nmedian line and a longitudinal opening is left in the roof of the mouth.\\r\\nThis is called Cleft Palate.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--Of course, upon examination this split is seen. It may involve\\r\\nnot only the hard palate, but also the soft palate and uvula. It is then\\r\\ngenerally accompanied by single or double hare-lip. When the severe forms\\r\\noccur they cause great trouble. Fluids pass freely into the nose, and\\r\\nunless the child is carefully fed by hand it will soon die, as it is\\r\\nunable to suck. In the less severe forms the child soon learns to swallow\\r\\nproperly, but when he learns to speak he cannot articulate properly and\\r\\nhis voice is nasal.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--For this reason an early operation is advisable, not so early\\r\\nas for hare-lip, but before the child has learned to speak, say between\\r\\nthe age of three and four when faulty speech (articulation) may be\\r\\novercome by successful closure of the palate. When the operation is done\\r\\nlate, the patient will not be able to overcome the bad habits of\\r\\narticulation acquired in his childhood.\\r\\n\\r\\n[370 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nOperation.--The anaesthetic is necessary. The end of one-half of the cleft\\r\\npalate is seized with an instrument and the edge freely pared with a thin\\r\\nbladed sharp knife; same with the other half. Then the stitches are put in\\r\\nof silk worm, gut or wire. The patient is fed on liquid food for three or\\r\\nfour days, and afterwards on soft food until the stitches are removed.\\r\\nThey are removed about the sixth or eighth day, and the wound should be\\r\\ncompletely healed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCROOKED FEET. Talipes.--There are many varieties. The treatment should be\\r\\nbegun, under the instructions of a physician, and continued from infancy\\r\\nand many a good foot can be obtained.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nKNOCK KNEE. (Genu Valgum).--This is due to an overgrowth of the internal\\r\\nknuckle (condyle) on the knee joint, and curving inward of the shaft of\\r\\nthe thigh-bone (femur) in its lower parts, with relaxation and lengthening\\r\\nof the ligaments of the knee joint.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt usually shows itself soon after the child begins to walk, but may not\\r\\ndo so until puberty,--rarely later. It is due in the child to rickets; in\\r\\nthe latter form, it is caused by an occupation that requires continued\\r\\nstanding, by a person of feeble development of the muscles and ligaments.\\r\\n\"Flat-foot\" is often associated with it and, at times, may be the real\\r\\ncause. It may affect one or both knees, may be so slight as to escape\\r\\ndetection, except upon a very careful examination, or so severe as to\\r\\nseparate the feet very widely and render walking difficult and wobbling.\\r\\nIn children other symptoms of rickets can generally be found. If not\\r\\nsevere it may often get better spontaneously as the rickets condition\\r\\nimproves and the general strength increases. This result is common in the\\r\\ncases occurring later, from standing if the general condition improves.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--Should be begun early and both general and local treatment\\r\\nshould be given. The quicker the treatment is begun, the quicker will be\\r\\nthe recovery and the deformity will be less. The ordinary medical and\\r\\nhygienic treatment should be given for rickets.\\r\\n\\r\\nLocal Treatment.--This is mechanical, supplemented by baths, rubbing,\\r\\nfriction, electricity and preceded, if necessary, by attending to the\\r\\nbones. If the rickets is still active, and the bones are soft and\\r\\nyielding, standing and walking should be forbidden, the limb should be\\r\\nstraightened by manipulation and the correct position secured and\\r\\nmaintained by an outside splint and bandage. Sometimes operative measures\\r\\nare needed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBOW LEGS. (Genu Varum).--This is the opposite of knock knees, and the\\r\\ndeformity usually affects both limbs, the knees being widely separated.\\r\\nThe disease begins in early childhood; the cause is rickets, and the\\r\\ndeformity is the direct result of the weight of the body and muscular\\r\\naction.\\r\\n\\r\\n[DEFORMITIES 371]\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--Spontaneous recovery occurs; but if the case is at all severe,\\r\\nand the child is young enough that the bones have not become firmly set in\\r\\nthe abnormal curves, mechanical treatment should be employed to bring the\\r\\nlimbs to a better position. This may be done by plaster of paris or\\r\\nbraces. This must be used intelligently and continuously. Children should\\r\\nnot be allowed to walk so early, especially those of slow development.\\r\\n\\r\\nCLUB FOOT (Talipes).--Varieties:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. The heel may be drawn up and the foot extended (Talipes Equinus).\\r\\n\\r\\n2. The foot may be flexed, bent up, (Talipes Calcaneus).\\r\\n\\r\\n3. The foot may be drawn inward, adducted, (Talipes Varus).\\r\\n\\r\\n4. The foot may be drawn outward, abducted, (Talipes Valgus); or, two may\\r\\nbe combined, extended, and drawn inward (Equino Varus).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the congenital (born with it) variety the displacement is almost always\\r\\none of adduction, that is, drawn inward, with commonly some elevation of\\r\\nthe heel. It generally affects both feet, but it may be confined to one\\r\\nand if only one is affected, the right is oftener affected than the left.\\r\\nThe deformity varies. At the time of birth and for some months afterwards\\r\\nthe deformity can usually be corrected by proper manipulation, but later,\\r\\nif left to itself, it becomes in greater or less measure fixed, because of\\r\\nthe muscular contraction, and developed changes in the shape of the bones.\\r\\n\\r\\nCause--It is not known.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment is successful if it is begun early. Each case should be treated\\r\\nas it needs. The treatment should be varied to suit each case. Bandaging\\r\\nor adhesive straps properly applied has been used with success. Sometimes\\r\\nthe leg must be kept motionless by plaster of Paris or gutta-percha\\r\\nbandages. They must be frequently removed and reapplied. In older cases\\r\\nthe tendons must be cut and braces applied. Parents are careless who\\r\\nneglect such a case for even one month.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nINTOXICANTS AND SUN STROKES\\r\\n\\r\\nALCOHOLISM. Acute Symptoms.--The face is flushed, the breath has the odor\\r\\nof liquor, the pulse is full and bounding with deep respiration. Reason,\\r\\nmemory, judgment and will are first stimulated and then blunted. The\\r\\ndrinker\\'s peculiarities are exaggerated, the person becoming affectionate\\r\\nor quarrelsome. There is a loss of coordination as shown by the\\r\\nstaggering, swinging, the relaxation of the muscles, and finally deep\\r\\nsleep, with snoring breathing. The person is unconscious, but can be\\r\\npartly aroused and will mutter when questioned or disturbed. The pupils\\r\\nare contracted or dilated, and they will dilate when the face is slapped.\\r\\nThe urine is increased, but it is often retained.\\r\\n\\r\\n[372 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHRONIC ALCOHOLISM.--This results from protracted or periodic \"sprees.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--The face is red, the capillaries are dilated, eyes are watery,\\r\\nconjunctiva is congested. There is chronic inflammation of the stomach,\\r\\nwhich is characterized by morning vomiting; there is often hardening of\\r\\nthe liver, trembling of the hands and tongue; the memory is weakened and\\r\\njudgment and will as well, especially until a stimulant has been taken;\\r\\noften the person is irritable, careless, with loss of moral sense and in\\r\\nextreme cases dementia. Peripheral neuritis is more common in men than in\\r\\nwomen. It begins with sharp pain and tingling in the feet and hands;\\r\\nparalysis affects the lower extremities, then the upper, and is most\\r\\nmarked in the further muscles of the limbs. The pain may be very severe,\\r\\nwith great tenderness. There is Arteriosclerosis (hardening of walls of\\r\\nthe arteries); often heart dilation.\\r\\n\\r\\nDELIRIUM TREMENS.--This is a brain manifestation of chronic alcoholism\\r\\noccurring in steady drinkers after excessive drinking or sudden withdrawal\\r\\nof alcohol, or after sudden excitement or accident, pneumonia or other\\r\\nillness, or lack of food.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--There are restlessness, insomnia (sleeplessness), mental\\r\\ndepression, then active delirium with great restlessness, talking,\\r\\nmuttering, hallucination of sight and hearing. He thinks he sees objects\\r\\nin the room such as rats, mice, or snakes, and fancies that they are\\r\\ncrawling over his body, has them in his boots, etc. The terror inspired by\\r\\nthese imaginary objects is great, and has given the popular name of\\r\\n\"horrors\" or \"snakes\" to the disease. You must watch the patient\\r\\nconstantly, or he may try to jump out of the window or escape. The patient\\r\\nmay think he hears sounds and voices, threats of imaginary enemies. There\\r\\nis much muscular \"shakings,\" the tongue is coated with a thick white fur\\r\\nand, when protruded, trembles. The pulse is rapid and soft, sleeplessness\\r\\nis a constant feature. Favorable cases improve in the third or fourth day,\\r\\nthe restlessness abates, the patient sleeps and the improvement sets in.\\r\\nThe shakings persist for some days, the hallucinations disappear\\r\\ngradually, and the appetite returns. In the more serious cases, the\\r\\nsleeplessness (insomnia) persists, the delirium is incessant, the pulse\\r\\nbecomes more frequent and feeble, the tongue dry, the prostration is\\r\\nextreme and death takes place from gradual heart failure.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--In acute alcoholic cases special measures are seldom required,\\r\\nas the patient sleeps off the effect of his \"spree.\" If there is deep\\r\\nprofound alcoholic coma, it may be proper to wash out the stomach and if\\r\\nsymptoms of collapse occur, the limbs should be rubbed, and hot\\r\\napplications made to the body.\\r\\n\\r\\n[INTOXICANTS AND SUN STROKES 373]\\r\\n\\r\\nChronic Alcoholism.--This is different; withdraw the alcohol and\\r\\nsubstitute strychnine, one-thirtieth of a grain three or four times a day,\\r\\nnourishing food, confinement in a sanitarium if necessary. Give the\\r\\nbromides for the restlessness and sleeplessness. Drugging of the liquor\\r\\nwith apo morphine or tartar emetic.\\r\\n\\r\\nMOTHER\\'S REMEDY. Drunkenness. 1. Effective as Cure for.--\\r\\n\\r\\n    \"Arsenious Acid       19 grains\\r\\n    Bromine Water         sufficient\\r\\n    Tribromide of Gold    14 grains\\r\\n    Distilled Water       sufficient\\r\\n\\r\\nTen drops of this solution for injection, which equals one thirty-second\\r\\ngrain of gold tribromide.\" This is an active tonic, powerful sedative and\\r\\ndestroys the appetite or cravings for alcoholic stimulants; the medicine\\r\\nis to be taken regularly four or five times a day for several weeks until\\r\\nthe alcohol is out of the system even though he may appear cured. This is\\r\\na good remedy, but should be given under the supervision of a doctor.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--The patient must be put into a bed and carefully watched;\\r\\nwithdraw alcohol at once unless the pulse is too feeble. Procure rest and\\r\\nsleep for the patient. How? In mild cases, thirty grains (one-half dram)\\r\\nof bromide of potassium, combined with tincture of capsicum five to ten\\r\\ndrops, may be given every three hours. Call a doctor for the rest. One\\r\\nhundredth grain hyoscine hypodermically is sometimes good; one-fourth\\r\\ngrain morphine hypodermically is sometimes given. For heart weakness:\\r\\nAromatic spirits of ammonia.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMORPHINE HABIT. (Morphinomania--Morphinism).--This is usually acquired by\\r\\nthe repeated use of the hypodermic syringe for pain. It is also used by\\r\\nthe mouth or opium smoking.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--At first it causes a sense of well-being and exhilaration, but\\r\\nit must be gradually increased to produce the result; when the effect\\r\\nwears off, the person feels weary, mentally and physically; has nausea,\\r\\nslight distress in the stomach region or pain like intestinal colic.\\r\\nAnother dose relieves these feelings, eventually the person becomes thin,\\r\\nhis face is sallow, the pupils are dilated or unequal, except when he is\\r\\nunder the influence of the drug. His appetite is poor with indigestion.\\r\\nSometimes itching of the skin, restlessness; irritable, disturbed sleep,\\r\\nand a tendency to lie about everything.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--The patient must be taken from home and friends and be\\r\\nconstantly watched. The drug should be withdrawn gradually and nourishing\\r\\nfood given at stated intervals.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCOCAINE HABIT.--The drug is taken as a snuff, hypodermically, or in sprays\\r\\nand often the habit is formed when given as sprays, etc., in disease.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--Large doses cause great excitement, sometimes convulsions,\\r\\nfollowed by weak heart and respiratory weakness, general prostration,\\r\\nconvulsions and coma.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cocaine habit causes emaciation, anemia, disturbances of the stomach,\\r\\netc., disordered heart action, weakness of the body and mind, nervous and\\r\\ngreat depravity.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--Same as for the morphine habit.\\r\\n\\r\\n[374 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHLORAL HABIT. Symptoms.--After a slight primary exhilaration there is\\r\\ndepression of the mind and body; skin eruptions, bad breath, spongy gums,\\r\\npoor appetite, indigestion, bad nutrition, permanent dilation of the\\r\\ncutaneous (skin) blood vessels, intermittent pulse, blunting of the higher\\r\\nmental faculties, restlessness, sleeplessness, irritability, sometimes\\r\\ndementia.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--Same as for morphine.\\r\\n\\r\\nLEAD POISONING. (Plumbism-Saturnism). Causes.--It is common in lead\\r\\nsmelters and grinders, painters, glaziers, and plumbers, whose hands are\\r\\nnot washed before eating. The lead is absorbed by the mouth, skin and\\r\\nlungs. It may be taken into the system by drinking water, cider, etc., in\\r\\nnew lead pipes, or from hair-dyes or cosmetics containing lead.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms of Acute Case.--These develop rapidly from continued exposure.\\r\\nThere is rapidly progressing anemia, with acute neuritis, epilepsy,\\r\\nconvulsions or delirium or with severe stomach and bowel symptoms.\\r\\n\\r\\nChronic Cases. Symptoms. 1.--Anemia, lead line on the gums, paralysis,\\r\\ncolic, and brain symptoms.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Blue-black line of lead in the gums near the teeth.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. This is preceded by an obstinate constipation. It resembles severe\\r\\nintestinal colic. There may be vomiting.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Paralysis. This is the result of peripheral neuritis, localized or\\r\\ngeneralized. Wrist drop and many other symptoms of local and general\\r\\nparalysis.\\r\\n\\r\\nTREATMENT. Prevention.--The hands and finger nails of the lead workers\\r\\nshould always be thoroughly cleaned before eating. Use respirators if lead\\r\\nis present in the form of dust.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor chronic poisoning remove the cause. Potassium iodide, five to ten\\r\\ngrains three times a day. Not to be given in acute cases or when the\\r\\nsymptoms are very severe, until what is in the bowels is removed.\\r\\n\\r\\nConstipation.--For this give a half ounce of epsom salts before breakfast\\r\\nwhen needed, or repeat in small doses.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor pain.--Heat over the abdomen and give morphine, if necessary.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFOOD POISONING. (Bromototoxismus).--Food may contain the specific\\r\\norganisms of disease, as of tuberculosis or trichinosis; milk and other\\r\\nfoods may become infected with typhoid bacilli, and so convey the disease.\\r\\nAnimals (or insects or bees) may feed on substances that cause their flesh\\r\\nor products to be poisonous to man. Meat poisoning. Eating sausage or pork\\r\\npie or headcheese has caused poisoning. Poisoning from impure milk, shell\\r\\nfish, pellagra, from using altered maize, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\n[INTOXICANTS AND SUN STROKES 375]\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--Acute inflammation of stomach and bowels, with great\\r\\nprostration, ending in collapse. In shell fish poisoning, there are\\r\\nnumbness, weakness, dilated pupils, rapid and feeble pulse, temperature\\r\\nunder the normal and collapse.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--In all cases empty the stomach by emetics or stomach tube and\\r\\nthe bowels by cathartics. Stimulate if necessary.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHEAT STROKE.--Called also heat exhaustion; thermic fever, coup de Soleil.\\r\\nA condition produced by exposure to excessive heat.\\r\\n\\r\\nHeat Exhaustion.--This is caused by continued exposure to high\\r\\ntemperatures, especially while working hard.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--Prostration with cool skin, temperature often below normal,\\r\\n95-96, pulse is small and frequent, sometimes restlessness and delirium.\\r\\nThe person need not necessarily be exposed to the direct rays of the sun,\\r\\nbut the condition may come on at night, or while at work in close,\\r\\nconfined rooms.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment of indoor heat exhaustion.--Aromatic spirits of ammonia one to\\r\\ntwo drams and strychnine; avoid alcohol. If the temperature is below\\r\\nnormal, (98.6) a warm bath can be given. Rest in bed in a well ventilated\\r\\nroom.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSUNSTROKE. Heat Stroke, Thermic (heat) Fever.--This occurs in persons\\r\\nchiefly who, while working very hard are exposed to the sun. Soldiers who\\r\\nare marching with their heavy accoutrements are very liable to be\\r\\nattacked. In large cities the most of the cases are confined to workmen\\r\\nwho are much exposed and at the same time, have been drinking beer and\\r\\nwhisky.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--The patient may be struck down and die very soon with symptoms\\r\\nof failure of the heart, difficult breathing and coma. This kind is most\\r\\nfrequent in soldiers. In ordinary cases there may be failure to perspire,\\r\\npremonitory headache, dizziness, sometimes nausea and vomiting, colored or\\r\\npoor sight (vision); insensibility follows, which may be temporary or\\r\\nincreased deep coma. The face is flushed, the skin is dry and hot, the\\r\\npupils are temporarily dilated, then usually greatly contracted, the pulse\\r\\nis rapid and full, and the temperature ranges from 107 to 110 degrees or\\r\\nhigher. The breathing is deep, labored and snoring (stortorous). Usually\\r\\nthere is complete muscular relaxation, with twitchings, jerkings, or very\\r\\nrarely convulsions may occur. In fatal cases, coma (deep sleep) deepens,\\r\\nthe pulse becomes more frequent and feeble, the breathing becomes more\\r\\nhurried, shallow and irregular and death may occur within twenty-four to\\r\\nthirty-six hours. In others, the consciousness returns, the temperature\\r\\nfalls, the pulse and breathing become normal and recovery may be complete\\r\\nor leave bad results. The patient may be predisposed to future attacks or\\r\\nsuffer from weakness or headache, and disturbance of the mind when ever\\r\\nthe weather is warm.\\r\\n\\r\\n[376 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nPrognosis.--The death rate is higher when treatment is delayed, and when\\r\\nalcohol has been used as a beverage.\\r\\n\\r\\nMOTHER\\'S REMEDY. Sunstroke, Quick Method to Relieve.--\"Apply alternately\\r\\nhot and cold applications to forehead and base of the brain or back of the\\r\\nneck, place the feet in warm mustard water, and apply mustard to the\\r\\nstomach and calves of legs. This remedy was tried by my brother\\'s wife,\\r\\nwho is a trained nurse. She says it is very effective,\" The hot and cold\\r\\napplications help to draw the blood from the brain. Placing feet in warm\\r\\nmustard water will help to give relief.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--Avoid exposure and alcohol. For a mild case--Rest in a cool\\r\\nplace, cool sponging, aromatic spirits ammonia or strychnine if needed for\\r\\nthe prostration.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor severe cases.--The temperature must be reduced as rapidly as possible.\\r\\nPack the patient in a bath of ice. Rubbing the body with ice is an\\r\\nexcellent procedure to lower the temperature rapidly. Ice water enemata\\r\\n(injections in bowel) may also be employed. If ice cannot be obtained\\r\\nstrip the patient and sprinkle him with water until the temperature is\\r\\nreduced. Use a thermometer to see it does not go too low. Ice cap or cold\\r\\nwater to the head. Keep working for hours.\\r\\n\\r\\nMedicine.--Glonoin, 1/100 to 1/200 grain is of help in severe cases.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nACCIDENTS, EMERGENCIES AND POISONS\\r\\n\\r\\nCOLLAPSE.--1. Place the patient flat on his back.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Raise the feet and lower his head, unless blueness of the face occurs.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Make the patient warm by applying warm coverings and hot water bottles,\\r\\nbricks or wood.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Enema of strong coffee.\\r\\n\\r\\n5. If necessary the legs and arms can be bandaged beginning at the feet\\r\\nand hands and then bandage up. Use above in order given.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFAINTING.--Place the patient on her back, with the head low and feet\\r\\nraised unless the face is flushed. The face is generally pale.\\r\\n\\r\\nLoosen the clothing about the waist, throat, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlenty of air and no crowding around the patient.\\r\\n\\r\\n      ACCIDENTS AND POISONS       377\\r\\n\\r\\nCold water on the face with cloths. It is not necessary to wet her all\\r\\nover. Ammonia or camphor near the nostrils to inhale. Lie still for some\\r\\ntime and do not attempt to rise while still feeling dizzy or faint.\\r\\n\\r\\nMOTHERS\\' REMEDIES.--1. Sea Sickness, Red Pepper and Molasses Relieves.--\\r\\n\"A teaspoonful of red pepper mixed with molasses and taken in one dose is\\r\\nconsidered one of the best remedies for this trouble.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Sea Sickness, Peppermint an Excellent Relief for.--\"A teaspoonful of\\r\\nessence of peppermint put in a tumbler of hot water, sipped occasionally,\\r\\nis both a preventive and cure for sea-sickness.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSea Sickness.--Dr. Hare, of Philadelphia, says: \"The bromides should be\\r\\nused in the dose of five to ten grains three times a day for several days\\r\\nbefore the patient sails to quiet the vomiting center.\" After sea sickness\\r\\nbegins the following combination is good:\\r\\n\\r\\n   (a)   Citric Acid           2 drams\\r\\n         Distilled Water       4 ounces\\r\\n         Make a solution.\\r\\n\\r\\n  (b)    Bromide of Potash        1 dram\\r\\n         Bicarbonate of Potash    1 dram\\r\\n         Distilled Water          4 ounces\\r\\n         Make a solution.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen a tablespoonful of each of these solutions should be added to one\\r\\nanother and taken during effervescence. Lemon juice can be used in place\\r\\nof citric acid in the first combination.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDOG BITES (Not Rabid).--Treat the same as for any torn wound, wash out\\r\\nthoroughly with hot water and an ounce of salt in a pint of water. There\\r\\nis no danger of hydrophobia from the bite of a dog, cat or any animal\\r\\nunless that animal has hydrophobia. No one can take hydrophobia from an\\r\\nanimal that does not have it. (See Hydrophobia).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPOISONED WOUNDS. Mosquito Bite.--Remove the sting in the wound. Diluted\\r\\nvinegar applied to the bites is sometimes of help. Camphor is also good.\\r\\n\\r\\nSnake Bite.--Naturalists have discovered twenty-seven species of poisonous\\r\\nserpents and one poisonous lizard; eighteen species of these are true\\r\\nrattlesnakes; the remaining nine are divided between varieties of the\\r\\nmoccasin, copperhead or the viper. The poisonous lizard is the Texan\\r\\nreptile known as the \"Gila Monster.\" In all these serpents the poison\\r\\nfluid is secreted in a gland which lies against the side of the skull\\r\\nbelow and behind the eye, from which a duct leads to the base of a hollow\\r\\ntooth or fang, one on each side of the upper jaw; which fang, except in\\r\\nthe case of vipers, is movable and susceptible of erection and depression.\\r\\nWhen not in use the fang hugs the upper jaw and is ensheathed in a fold of\\r\\nmucous membrane. In the vipers the fang is permanently erect. In the case\\r\\nof biting the contents of the poison sac are forcibly ejected through the\\r\\nhollow fang.\\r\\n\\r\\n[378 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms of a Snake Bite.--The symptoms are similar in bites of poisonous\\r\\nsnakes. Pain in the wound, slight at first, but becoming more severe, with\\r\\nrapid swelling and spotted discoloration in the vicinity of the wound.\\r\\nSymptoms of heart and lung depression soon show themselves by feeble and\\r\\nfluttering pulse, faintness, cold sweating, mental distress, nausea and\\r\\nvomiting and labored breathing. Death may occur very soon in intense\\r\\npoisoned cases, but more frequently the struggle extends over a number of\\r\\nhours.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--First thing to do.--When the bite is on a limb, tie the limb\\r\\nabove the bite toward the body and twist the ligature so tight that the\\r\\ncirculation is cut off, or checked. Then cut the wound open very freely.\\r\\nWhen the bite is on the body, make a free cut, and when this cannot be\\r\\ndone suck the wound vigorously, which can done without danger, if there\\r\\nare no cracks or abrasions of the lips or mouth, as the poison is harmless\\r\\nwhen taken into a well mouth. If a hot iron is at hand apply it freely\\r\\nwithin the wound and this may take the place of the knife or suction. Salt\\r\\nput in the cut wound will be of help, or fill the wound with permanganate\\r\\nof potash and inject a solution of the same, diluted three-quarters with\\r\\nwater, around the wound. Strychnine one-fifteenth of a grain every two\\r\\nhours until the symptoms are better. This is not given until the symptoms\\r\\nof snake poisoning have shown themselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf such agents are not at hand, brandy or whisky should be given freely.\\r\\nThe pulse will show when the patient has had enough.\\r\\n\\r\\nMOTHERS\\' REMEDIES. INSECT AND OTHER BITES.--1. Simply Use Pepper for Dog\\r\\nBite.--\"My son had his hand bitten by a dog and it was over a week before\\r\\nit was brought to my notice. The sore was then filled with green pus and\\r\\nthe pain went up to his jaw, so we were afraid of lockjaw. I had him\\r\\ncleanse it thoroughly in a basin of warm saleratus water, then filled and\\r\\nthickly covered it with black pepper. The pain stopped almost instantly.\\r\\nIt seems as though pepper would smart a cut terribly, but it does not.\"\\r\\nThis is a good remedy and worth trying. The black pepper did not smart the\\r\\nwound because the flesh was dead.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Bites, Tobacco Good for Dog.--\"Immediately wash the parts with clear\\r\\nwater; then take leaf or cut tobacco and bind over the part bitten,\\r\\nchanging it two or three times a day for a week. This effectually absorbs\\r\\nthe poison. It is a good prevention of any future trouble.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Bites, Ammonia Good for Insect.--\"Rub the affected parts with ammonia,\\r\\nwhich will draw out the poison. For mosquito bites have often used baking\\r\\nsoda. This always gives relief and is very cooling.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Bites, Baking Soda for Insect.--\"Cover the affected parts with baking\\r\\nsoda and keep moist.\" A mud poultice is an old tried remedy.\\r\\n\\r\\n[ACCIDENTS AND POISONS 379]\\r\\n\\r\\n5. Bites, Hartshorn Old Time Remedy for.--\"Apply hartshorn or spirits of\\r\\nammonia to part which neutralizes the formic acid, the active principle of\\r\\nthe poison.\" This is an old-time remedy and will always give relief if\\r\\napplied immediately.\\r\\n\\r\\n6. Bites, Carbolic Acid Draws Poison from.--\"Bathe frequently in a weak\\r\\nsolution of carbolic acid.\" The carbolic acid is a very good remedy and\\r\\nseldom fails to cure, but if you do not happen to have the acid, use\\r\\nvinegar, and it will have practically the same effect.\\r\\n\\r\\n7. Bites, Alum and Vinegar Good Remedy for.--\"Alum and vinegar. Purchase\\r\\nfive cents\\' worth of powdered alum and dissolve in a pint of vinegar and\\r\\napply freely. This is a very good remedy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n8. Bites, Salt Water for Mosquito.--\"Take salt and water in a little dish\\r\\nand keep wetting the bite for a few moments. This will soon destroy the\\r\\npoison,\" This will be found a very simple but effective remedy, especially\\r\\nin children or small babies, as we mothers all know how very annoying a\\r\\nmosquito bite is to children. The salt water will remove all the poison\\r\\nand at the same time relieve the itching and swelling. Care should be\\r\\ntaken not to make it too strong for a small baby.\\r\\n\\r\\n9. Bites, Spirits of Ammonia for Snake.--\"Strong spirits of ammonia\\r\\napplied to the wounds of snake bites or rabid animals is better than\\r\\ncaustic. It neutralizes the poison.\" Enough of the ammonia should be used\\r\\nto irritate the parts. It is harmless treatment and should be used freely.\\r\\n\\r\\nSTINGS, MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES.--1. Leaves of Geranium Good for Bee or\\r\\nWasp.--\"Bruise the leaves of geranium and bind on the affected part. This\\r\\nhas proved an excellent, though simple remedy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Stings, Simple Remedy for.--\"Take a dresser key or any with a good\\r\\nsized hole and press over the sting. If used very soon this will remove\\r\\nthe stinger, then cover with wet salt.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDISLOCATIONS.--A dislocation is the putting out of joint some bone, such\\r\\nas the elbow or shoulder bone or bones. The bone has slipped out of its\\r\\nsocket. They are called after the joints involved.\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral Causes.--Blows, sudden contraction of the muscles; also due to\\r\\nsome diseases of the joints.\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral Symptoms.--There is a deformity at the joint, pain and sometimes\\r\\nit is not possible to make all the joint movements.\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral Treatment.--Of course it is to replace the bone, as soon as\\r\\npossible, before there is much swelling, inflammation and consequent\\r\\nadhesions.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDISLOCATION OF THE JAW.--It is not possible to close the mouth. The chin\\r\\nis too far forward. The jaw may turn toward the other side in one-sided\\r\\ndislocation.\\r\\n\\r\\n[380 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--Hold something hard between the teeth in front so that when\\r\\nthe jaw snaps in place your thumbs will not be bitten. A piece of wood as\\r\\nthick as your fingers will do. Stand in front of the patient, who should\\r\\nbe sitting in a high chair. Put your thumbs in the mouth upon the lower\\r\\njaw two-thirds of the length backwards, and your forefingers directly\\r\\nunderneath the jaw; with the thumbs press down and with the fingers pull\\r\\nforward.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\nOblique Bandage of Jaw.\\r\\nMedicated Cotton can readily be applied with this\\r\\nstyle of Bandage.\\r\\nBandaging and Photograph by\\r\\nDR. W. E. ZIEGENFUSS, of Detroit.\\r\\nDone expressly for this book.]\\r\\n\\r\\nSometimes it is necessary to hold the jaw in place for some days. For that\\r\\npurpose the bandage for a broken jaw can be used.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSHOULDER JOINT DISLOCATION.--There is a depression of the skin over the\\r\\ncavity. The shoulder is flattened. The bone of the arm points to where the\\r\\nhead of the bone is.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--Carry the elbow to the side with the forearm at right angles\\r\\nto the arm: turn the arm around until the forearm points away from the\\r\\nbody. Then carry the arm up from the body until it is level with the\\r\\nshoulder. In this position gradually rotate the arm again and then bring\\r\\nthe arm to the side, with the forearm across the chest, hand pointing to\\r\\nthe other shoulder when it should be bandaged by pieces of bandages three\\r\\ninches wide passing around the arm, elbow and body. A pad should be placed\\r\\nunder the hand to keep it from making the flesh sore.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFINGER OR THUMB DISLOCATION.--If the joint is dislocated forward pull the\\r\\nfront part forward and backward. If it is dislocated backwards, pull the\\r\\nfront part of the finger forward and upward. If reduced immediately this\\r\\nneeds no bandaging.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFRACTURES.--They are simply broken bones or cartilage, usually applied\\r\\npopularly to a broken bone.\\r\\n\\r\\nVarieties.--Simple fracture means a break of the bone only.\\r\\n\\r\\nCompound fracture is where the broken bone sticks out through the skin.\\r\\n\\r\\n      ACCIDENTS AND POISONS       381\\r\\n\\r\\nComminuted is where the bone is broken into small parts.\\r\\n\\r\\nImpacted is where one part of the broken bone is driven into the other\\r\\npart.\\r\\n\\r\\nGreen stick break. This is not really a break, but only a bending of the\\r\\nbone, seen mostly in children.\\r\\n\\r\\nBandages for fractures can be made of muslin. They should be six to eight\\r\\nto twelve yards long for large bones.\\r\\n\\r\\nWidth. For a finger one inch.\\r\\n       For arm or head two and one-half inches.\\r\\n       For the leg three to four inches.\\r\\n       For the body six to eight inches.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn old sheet can be used and the ends of the strips sewed together and\\r\\nthen wrapped tight in a roll, with the ravelings from the sides removed.\\r\\nThe bandage should be started from the end of the limb, wrapped towards\\r\\nthe body. They should not be wrapped so tightly as to shut off\\r\\ncirculation,\\r\\n\\r\\nPadding.--This should be of cotton. In case of necessity, handkerchiefs,\\r\\ntowels, pieces of muslin, cloths; hay or grass can be used temporarily.\\r\\n\\r\\nSplints.--In emergencies splints can be made from shingles, pasteboards or\\r\\neven bark.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow to Take Hold of a Broken Leg or Arm.--Never take hold of it from\\r\\nabove, but slip the hands underneath, and then take a firm but gentle hold\\r\\nat two points a short distance from the break on each side, and all the\\r\\nwhile making slight extension with the hand on the end part (distal part)\\r\\nso as to keep the ends from rubbing together, and lift with both hands at\\r\\nthe same time slowly and evenly until the limb is in the required\\r\\nposition. Then apply the emergency treatment. This is to help keep the\\r\\nbroken parts in place until proper care can be given, or to assist in\\r\\nsafely and comfortably moving the patient to the place desired. Support\\r\\nthe broken limb with something smooth and stiff, such as a thin narrow\\r\\nshingle, three inches wide perhaps, or thin board, stout pasteboard, or\\r\\nthe bark of trees, and padded with something soft, such as cotton, wool,\\r\\nhay, straw, leaves, which can be held by bandages of required width, or\\r\\nhandkerchiefs folded in triangular shape, or by strips of linen, muslin,\\r\\nribbon or anything with which the splint can be temporarily held fast.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the Forearm.--Two padded splints three to four inches wide and long\\r\\nenough to take in the hand also should be applied, one to the thumb, and\\r\\nthe other to the back of the forearm, slight extension being made by\\r\\npulling on the patient\\'s hand. This pulls the broken end in place. Tie on\\r\\nthe splints over the hand, wrist and just below the elbow. Two or three\\r\\nwraps of adhesive plaster or five or six wraps of a bandage or\\r\\nhandkerchief or towel folded and pinned will temporarily hold the limb in\\r\\nplace. Put on a sling reaching from the finger tips to beyond the elbow.\\r\\n\\r\\n[382 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the Arm.--Put on two padded splints from the shoulder to the elbow,\\r\\none in front and the one behind, and bind on at the bottom and top. Then\\r\\nplace the forearm on the chest pointing to the well or sound shoulder and\\r\\nbind the arm with bandages or a long towel to the body.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a Broken Leg.--Pull on the foot gently to make slight extension, and\\r\\nlift the leg on a pillow or some sort of pad, and tie this firmly about\\r\\nthe leg; or broad strips of wood may be padded and placed on either side\\r\\nof the broken leg and securely tied.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a Broken Thigh, Upper Leg.--The splint should extend from under the\\r\\narm to the ankle, padded and bound to the body and to the leg by means of\\r\\nlong towels or pieces of sheeting applied six inches apart. If the patient\\r\\nis in a wagon and no splint can be had, bags of dirt or sand applied\\r\\naround the thigh will hold some. But there is always something at hand to\\r\\nuse as a splint and to bind the splint to the leg.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a Broken Collar Bone.--Place the patient on his back if he is to be\\r\\nmoved and put a firm pad in the arm pit and bind the arm to the side with\\r\\nthe forearm across the chest; or if you have a roll of adhesive plaster\\r\\ntwo or three inches wide, after putting a pad in the arm pit (sometimes\\r\\nthis is not necessary) put the adhesive strip around the arm midway to the\\r\\nshoulder. The arm should be lifted up and a little back. Run the strip of\\r\\nadhesive plaster around the body and fasten to the first part. Then put\\r\\nanother strip fast to the band around the arm and run this down around the\\r\\nbent elbow and over the forearm placed on the chest, the fingers pointing\\r\\nto the sound shoulder. This strip can pass over the sound collar bone and\\r\\nfasten to the strip about the body. If it is put on properly, the injured\\r\\npart will feel comfortable.\\r\\n\\r\\nBroken Ribs.--Put on a towel, about eight to twelve inches wide. This\\r\\nshould go around the body and be pinned tightly; or, if you have a roll of\\r\\nadhesive plaster, two and one-half to three inches wide, use this. Start\\r\\nat the backbone, at the lowest point necessary, about two ribs below the\\r\\nbroken one, and carry it straight across the chest to the breast bone; put\\r\\non about eight of such strips, lapping each about one-half inch. Fasten\\r\\nthe ends with a strip running up and down one-half on the flesh and the\\r\\nother half on the strip. This is to keep the strips from slipping any. The\\r\\narms should be held up while the strips are being applied.\\r\\n\\r\\nA Broken Jaw.--Take a strong piece of muslin, long enough to reach around\\r\\nthe neck and eight inches longer. Split this through the center to within\\r\\nabout seven inches of the center of the band. Put this unsplit part above,\\r\\nover and under the chin. Tie the upper tails around the neck and run the\\r\\nunder tail pieces up in front of the ear to the crown of the head. Tie\\r\\neach end on the back part of the head to the pieces left over after tying\\r\\nback of the neck.\\r\\n\\r\\n[ACCIDENTS AND POISONS 383]\\r\\n\\r\\nBroken Nose.--Put the parts in place by pressure and moulding. It is\\r\\neasily done. Do not hurry. Put a strip of adhesive plaster across the\\r\\nbridge of the nose over the break reaching to the cheek.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the injury causes bleeding, the wound should be washed with clean linen\\r\\nand boiled water and covered with clean linen. To wash the wound, one\\r\\nteaspoonful of salt to one pint of boiled water. Salt is usually at hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf an artery is cut, this bleeding must be stopped. The blood spurts out.\\r\\nPress your hands hard on the back of the thigh towards the body of the\\r\\nwound. Another should tie some cloth around the thigh above the wound\\r\\ntightly. It can be made tighter by putting a stick under the band and\\r\\ntwisting it around as much as possible. Raise the leg high up and put the\\r\\nhead low. If the cut is below the knee or on the foot, bend the leg back.\\r\\nFirst put a pad or your fist in under the knee joint and bend leg over the\\r\\npad or your fist. Sometimes the spurting artery can be caught or pressed\\r\\nupon with your finger. If the arm is injured, bandage as for the thigh. If\\r\\nthe forearm, the same as for the leg.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf a finger is cut clean off, pick the piece up and wash it and the stump\\r\\nclean and then place the cut off part against the stump and tie on, or\\r\\nstick on with adhesive plaster. It sometimes grows fast.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSPRAINS.--Sprains or wrenches of the joints are caused by a twist or a\\r\\nblow. The injury consists in the tear or rupture of a number of the fibres\\r\\nof the ligaments.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--Severe pain, the joint is practically useless for a time;\\r\\nswelling, heat and later the joint discolored from effusion of the blood\\r\\ninto the tissues.\\r\\n\\r\\nMOTHERS\\' REMEDIES.--1. Sprains, Ointment for.--\"The bark of bittersweet\\r\\nwith chamomile and wormwood simmered in fresh lard make an excellent\\r\\nointment for sprains and swellings.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Sprains, Vinegar and Bran Poultice for.--\"Make a poultice with vinegar\\r\\nand bran only, or with the addition of oatmeal, or bread crumbs. As the\\r\\npoultice becomes dry it should be moistened with vinegar.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Sprains, Turpentine Most Common Remedy for.--\"Rub the injured part with\\r\\nturpentine and keep warm and you will find this remedy to be one of the\\r\\nbest to keep proud flesh out that has ever been used. I always have\\r\\nturpentine in my home and find that I have to use it often, and it always\\r\\ndoes as I said above, if once used you will never be without it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Sprains, Quick Relief for.--\"Bathe the parts with hot water as hot as\\r\\none can bear it and relief comes at once.\" This is an old tried remedy,\\r\\nbut if hot water does not give relief use cold water.\\r\\n\\r\\n5. Sprains, Relieves Pain of.--\"Put warm woolen cloth over sprain, drip\\r\\nhot water as hot as can be borne on cloth for half hour.

Sprains, Arnica Much Used for.--\"Tincture of arnica.\" This should be\\r\\ndiluted with water about one and one-half for adults and one and\\r\\nthree-fourths for a child. This is one of the best known remedies for\\r\\nsprains that can be obtained. Apply freely to the bruise or sprain.\\r\\n\\r\\nPHYSICIANS\\' TREATMENT for Sprains.--Rest for a time (for some weeks). The\\r\\nparts should be raised to lessen the blood supply. Hot applications,\\r\\nthrough fomentations, or cold evaporations, lotions, massage later, and\\r\\nsupport with a pad and a firm bandage, in some cases. When there is not\\r\\nmuch swelling, a plaster of Paris bandage is sometimes applied at once in\\r\\norder that absolute rest can be secured.\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Tincture of Arnica.--This is an excellent remedy for sprains When the\\r\\npart is much swollen and looks bluish is when it is especially beneficial.\\r\\nIt can be used full strength by saturating cloths and applying either hot\\r\\nor cold, or diluted to half strength.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Hot Water.--Applied with soaked cloths on the part is very grateful in\\r\\nsome cases. It should be kept hot and plenty of water on the part all the\\r\\ntime. This should be applied for hours. Between the soakings, the parts\\r\\nshould be dressed with the lead and laudanum wash, and rubbed with\\r\\nichthyol ointment or camphor and laudanum liniment.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Cold Applications.--Cold water.--Some patients are more benefited by\\r\\nthe cold applications. The part should be elevated and a cloth wrung out\\r\\nof ice cold water, or an ice bag should be kept on the part.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Lead and Laudanum Wash.--This should not be used if the skin is broken.\\r\\nThen the laudanum, three-fourths water, can be used alone. Composition of\\r\\nlead and laudanum wash, proportions four parts of undiluted lead water,\\r\\ndiluted with sixteen parts of water to one of laudanum. This can be made\\r\\nstronger in the laudanum.\\r\\n\\r\\n[386 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\n5. Fomentations of hops, or smartweed or wormwood, etc., are also good.\\r\\n\\r\\n6.

SCALDS.--\\r\\n\\r\\nA Burn is caused by dry heat.\\r\\n\\r\\nA Scald is caused by moist heat.\\r\\n\\r\\nA superficial burn, upon a young child, that involves the third of the\\r\\nbody will almost certainly prove fatal, while a very deep burn, provided\\r\\nit is localized, may not be so serious, unless important nerves and blood\\r\\nvessels have been destroyed.\\r\\n\\r\\nBurns may be divided into three degrees:\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst degree are those burns that only affect the outer or superficial\\r\\nlayer of the skin, producing a redness with some small vesicles.\\r\\n\\r\\nSecond degree burns: These extend through the true skin and blisters\\r\\nresult.\\r\\n\\r\\nThird degree burns: This goes down underneath and involves the deeper\\r\\ntissues. Charring and destruction of tissue takes place.\\r\\n\\r\\nMOTHERS\\' REMEDIES. 1. Burns, Linseed Oil for.--\"Quick application of\\r\\nlinseed oil.\" The oil forms a coating and is very soothing.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Burns, Common Soda for.--\"There is nothing better than common baking\\r\\nsoda for burns and scalds; apply a thick coating of dry soda. Bind a cloth\\r\\nover it, and keep on until the pain ceases, after which any good healing\\r\\nsalve will do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n3. \"Apply crushed onion poultice; cover to keep out the air. This will\\r\\nsoon extract the heat and pain.\" Onions seem to possess many medicinal\\r\\nproperties. They are very soothing, and in a case of scalds keep out the\\r\\nair and relieve the pain.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Burns, Molasses Takes Pain from.--\"Apply New Orleans molasses to the\\r\\nburn and cover with flour. This forms a coating over the affected parts,\\r\\nkeeping the air from it, thereby relieving the burning. This is an\\r\\nexcellent remedy and one easily prepared.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n5. Burns, Butter a Relief for.--\"Spread butter on the affected parts and\\r\\nbandage well. This is one of the remedies our grandmothers used to use and\\r\\nis a good one.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n6. Burns, Oil of Peppermint Draws Fire Out of.--\"Apply oil of peppermint;\\r\\nit will take the fire out almost immediately.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n7. Burns, Sweet Oil and Cotton Batting Relieves.--\"Saturate cotton batting\\r\\nin sweet oil and cover the burns and keep covered until the fire is out. I\\r\\nhad my hand burned with steam until the skin peeled off, and this remedy\\r\\nrelieved the smarting.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n8. Burns, Vinegar Prevents Blistering from.--\"Vinegar applied every few\\r\\nminutes will keep it from blistering.\" This is a remedy always at hand,\\r\\nand will do just what it says.\\r\\n\\r\\n[388 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nMOTHERS\\' REMEDIES. 1. Scalds, Elder Berries Soothing for.--\"The flowers of\\r\\nthe black elder berries and the bark all possess valuable medicinal\\r\\nproperties. An ointment made by stirring the fresh flowers into melted\\r\\nlard or vaselin and occasionally stirring it, will be found an excellent\\r\\nremedy for scalds or burns.\" It is not only soothing, but forms a coating\\r\\nthereby keeping the air out.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Scalds, Alum for Slight.--\"Put a teaspoonful of alum in a pint of\\r\\nwater, and bathe the parts frequently. Keep the parts well wet with this\\r\\nsolution which extracts the heat in a remarkable manner and soothes the\\r\\npatient into a calm and refreshing sleep.\" This remedy is most always at\\r\\nhand and will relieve if the case is not too severe.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Scalds, Scraped Potatoes will Relieve.--\" A few raw potatoes scraped or\\r\\ngrated and beaten in a bowl, then add a dram of laudanum; apply to the\\r\\naffected parts as you would a poultice.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Scalds, Crackers and Slippery Elm as Poultice for.--\"Apply a poultice\\r\\nof cracker and slippery elm, made of raspberry leaf tea. Guard against\\r\\ntaking cold.\" Use enough of the raspberry tea to make a soft mixture. This\\r\\nis very soothing, and keeps the air from the scald which is one of the\\r\\nessential things in order to get relief.\\r\\n\\r\\n5. Scalds, Raisins\\' and Lard with Tobacco Helps.\\r\\n\\r\\n   \"One pound Raisins, chopped.\\r\\n    One pound Lard.\\r\\n    Five cent package of Chewing Tobacco.\\r\\n\\r\\nMix all together and let this simmer about three hours slowly, strain it\\r\\nand put in a jar.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n6. Scalds, Sweet Oil Soothing for.--\"I know of nothing better than equal\\r\\nparts of sweet oil and lime water.\" This is very good and should be\\r\\napplied freely.\\r\\n\\r\\nPHYSICIANS\\' TREATMENT for Superficial Bums.--Exclude the air; protect and\\r\\ntreat the parts is the theory of treatment.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuperficial Burn.--When the skin is not broken, bicarbonate of soda may be\\r\\nsprinkled thick over the burn, then wrap the part in moist gauze, lint or\\r\\nlinen, and over this a layer of common cotton, and hold in place with a\\r\\nbandage. Flour can be used in place of the soda. Oatmeal flour, rice\\r\\nflour, etc., will do also. The objection to all powders is that the moist\\r\\ngauze, etc., will make the flour form cakes and make removal painful and\\r\\ndifficult. Applications in liquid form are therefore better.\\r\\n\\r\\nLiquid Forms.--If the blisters are large, open them with a clean\\r\\n(sterile-boiled) instrument (scissors or knife) and absorb the fluid with\\r\\na clean gauze. Then dissolve bicarbonate of soda in water--a saturated\\r\\nsolution. This term means as much soda as the water will dissolve. Then\\r\\ngauze, lint or linen pads may be wrung out of this solution or the same\\r\\nstrength of boric acid solution and applied. Put over this a layer of\\r\\nclean cotton and hold in place by a bandage or strip of adhesive plaster.\\r\\n(Keep parts always moist). Baking soda will do about as well as\\r\\nbicarbonate of soda.\\r\\n\\r\\n[ACCIDENTS AND POISONS 389]\\r\\n\\r\\nOil and ointments are also very beneficial. Spread the ointments or oil\\r\\nover the burn thick and cover with lint or soft linen, and change\\r\\nfrequently to keep from smelling badly.\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Carron oil made of equal parts of lime-water and linseed oil is good.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Carbolized oil or simple pure sweet oil is good.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Cosmoline, Vaselin, Pineoline (salves) are all good; they cover and\\r\\nprotect.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Cold cream is very good.\\r\\n\\r\\n5. Thick lather from any good pure soap spread over the part thick and\\r\\nthen covered with the cloth dressing. This is very good and is always at\\r\\nhand.\\r\\n\\r\\n6. Dr. Douglas, of Detroit, very strongly recommends the following simple\\r\\nremedy: One teaspoonful of common salt to one pint of boiled water, used\\r\\ncomfortably warm. Old clean muslin or gauze cloths of several thicknesses\\r\\nshould be dipped in this solution and spread evenly over the sores in\\r\\nseveral layers and over this oiled paper or paraffine paper should be\\r\\napplied to prevent evaporation or drying and bind all with a bandage. The\\r\\ncovering should not be too thick or it might make the part too warm. This\\r\\nshould be avoided in all dressings.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis salt water dressing can be moistened and changed when necessary.\\r\\n\\r\\n7. Beeswax ointment. (Dr. Douglas).-\\r\\n\\r\\n    \"Benzoinated Lard    6 ounces.\\r\\n    Yellow Beeswax       1 ounce.\\r\\n    Salicylic Acid       20 grains.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMix the wax in a tin cup, then add the lard, when all is melted remove\\r\\nfrom the fire and stir till cool, then add the salicylic acid and continue\\r\\nstirring until cold. This makes an excellent covering, excludes the air.\\r\\n\\r\\n8. Ointment of Oxide of Zinc is very good. The following are the\\r\\ningredients:\\r\\n\\r\\n    \"Oxide of Zinc        2 drams.\\r\\n    Lanoline              5 drams.\\r\\n    Alboline              1 dram.\\r\\n    Salicylic Acid       10 grains.\\r\\n\\r\\nMix, and make ointment and apply.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following is not very pleasant to think about, but farmers have\\r\\nfrequently used it: Cow manure as a poultice.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother: The inner bark of elder boiled in cream. Use the salve resulting.\\r\\nThis is good for burns and sores.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother: Slippery elm bark tea boiled down so it will be thick and oily,\\r\\nis very good.\\r\\n\\r\\n[390 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome claim that immersing the part in milk and keeping it so is a very\\r\\ngood remedy. We know that cream is, but it will soon become rancid.\\r\\n\\r\\nRemedies must be of an oily covering nature to do good, or else do it by\\r\\ntheir antiseptic qualities like salt, boric acid, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother:\\r\\n\\r\\n    \"Picric Acid         75 grains.\\r\\n    Alcohol              20 ounces.\\r\\n    Distilled Water       2 pints.\\r\\n\\r\\n    Mix and apply.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCleanse the burns of dirt and charred clothing and then soak strips of\\r\\nclean gauze in this solution and apply to the part. Place over this a pad\\r\\nof dry absorbent cotton which can be fastened by a light bandage or\\r\\nadhesive straps. The dressing dries rapidly, and may be left in place for\\r\\nseveral days. Then moisten it with the same solution so as to soften the\\r\\ndressing and remove it. Then apply a fresh dressing of the same kind and\\r\\nleave on a week. This dressing soon relieves the pain, prevents the\\r\\nformation of matter (pus), hastens healing and, leaves a smooth surface.\\r\\nThe dressing stains the hands so it is best applied with rubber gloves.\\r\\nThis is good for all degree burns.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor Severe Case.--There may be and is shock and great weakness after some\\r\\nburns. The patient should be put to bed and given strong black coffee, or\\r\\nif you have it one teaspoonful of aromatic spirits of ammonia in a glass\\r\\nof water. Hot water bags and jars should be applied to the feet and one\\r\\nteaspoonful of paregoric may be given to an adult for the pain. Give the\\r\\npatient ice to hold in his mouth, as he is very thirsty. Cold water and\\r\\nmilk to drink also. If the burn is severe put oil cloth or rubber on the\\r\\nbed to protect the bed from the wet dressing. Do not put a night-shirt or\\r\\npajamas on him, as it pains to remove and renew the dressings, if such are\\r\\nused as need frequent removal and renewal. Cover warmly, but keep covers\\r\\nlifted so that their weight will not give unnecessary pain. The bowels can\\r\\nbe kept open with soap-suds enemas. Watch carefully, especially a man, if\\r\\nurine is passed and enough in quantity. It must be drawn if it is not\\r\\npassed within twelve hours.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor Third Degree Burns.--In this kind there is a great shock. Stimulate\\r\\nthe patient with whisky, etc. Put one ounce in a glass one-half full of\\r\\nwater, and give two teaspoonfuls frequently, dependent upon how much\\r\\nstimulant the patient has ever used; or an enema of one ounce of hot\\r\\ncoffee can be given.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first dressings may be the same, but when the patient is stronger\\r\\nothers should be used.\\r\\n\\r\\nWarm Baths are now used when the deep tissues are burned, and the sloughs\\r\\nand charred material are removed.\\r\\n\\r\\n[ACCIDENTS AND POISONS 391]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen convenient, begin with a warm tub bath, with boric acid added to the\\r\\nwater--handful to the tub. This is good for stimulating purposes, and\\r\\nalso to relieve pain and for cleansing the surfaces before the\\r\\napplications of the dressings, these can be of those recommended.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the air passages have been scalded by hot steam or hot liquids, the\\r\\nsteam of lime-water, not too hot, may soothe.\\r\\n\\r\\nBurns from Acid.--Soda, chalk, whiting, sprinkled over the surface of the\\r\\nskin and covered with moist coverings of gauze. Egg albumen is also good\\r\\napplied, on the part.\\r\\n\\r\\nBums from Alkali (like potash or strong ammonia).--Vinegar poured over the\\r\\npart, or dress with a mild solution of boric acid. One teaspoonful to four\\r\\nounces of water.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMOTHERS\\' REMEDIES. 1.

Bruises, Turpentine to Keep Proud Flesh from.--\"Rub the injured part\\r\\nwith turpentine and keep warm, and you will find this remedy to be one of\\r\\nthe best to keep proud flesh out and gangrene that has ever been used. I\\r\\nalways have turpentine in my home, and find that I have use for it often.\\r\\nIf once used you will never be without it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Bruises, Bread and Vinegar Quick Remedy for.--\"Apply a poultice made of\\r\\nhot vinegar and bread. A girl bruised her fingers with some iron rings in\\r\\na gymnasium. She applied this poultice at night, and they were well in the\\r\\nmorning. Since then I always use it for a bruise.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n5. Bruises, Good Liniment for.--\"Where inflammation is under the thin\\r\\ncovering of the bone, dissolve chloral and camphor gum together. They\\r\\ndissolve each other by putting together, and looks like glycerin. Apply\\r\\nvery little with tip of finger, put absorbent cotton on and bind up with\\r\\npure gum rubber band to keep it from evaporating as it is very volatile.\\r\\nRubber band must not be too tight, as it will cut off the circulation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n6. Bruises, Liniment Used in Ohio for.--\"Five cents\\' worth spirits\\r\\nammonia, five cents\\' worth spirits turpentine, whites of two eggs beaten,\\r\\none cup cider vinegar, two cups rain water.\" This gentleman from Ohio says\\r\\nhe has used the liniment for many years, and his neighbors have used it\\r\\nwith the utmost success. He recommends it as the best he ever used.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPHYSICIANS\\' TREATMENT. Bruises.--1. Tincture of Arnica applied from\\r\\none-half to full strength is very good.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Alcohol about two-thirds strength is also very good, gently rubbed in\\r\\nthe parts.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Cold or hot water applied with cloths.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Raw beefsteak (lean) is excellent. Place it on the bruise.\\r\\n\\r\\n5. Lead and laudanum wash if the skin is not broken. Of course bruises\\r\\nusually disappear in time. The above remedies will help. Heat applied at\\r\\nsome distance from the parts relaxes the surrounding vessels and promotes\\r\\nabsorption of the blood in the bruise.\\r\\n\\r\\n[392 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nCUTS. WOUNDS.--They are named cut (incised); contused, such as made by a\\r\\nblunt instrument.\\r\\n\\r\\nLacerated or torn, when the tissues are torn or ragged.\\r\\n\\r\\nPunctured, stab-wounds, when made by a pointed instrument.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--There may be pain, gaping (opening) of the edges and bleeding.\\r\\nIn order to gape, the cut must pass through the deep skin. Cuts or wounds\\r\\nthat do not go deep leave little or no scar. Such require only a little\\r\\nantiseptic dressing like this remedy:\\r\\n\\r\\n    \"Boric Acid      1/2 ounce.\\r\\n    Boiled Water       1 pint.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWash the cut thoroughly and cover with gauze or clean linen. Cuts or\\r\\nwounds should always be washed first with boiled water, cooled enough to\\r\\nuse. Do this with absolutely clean muslin, absorbent cotton or gauze and\\r\\nboiled water. After being thoroughly cleansed and washed with hot water\\r\\nand cloths, a thick pad of muslin, absorbent cotton or gauze thoroughly\\r\\nsoaked with the boric acid solution, (strength one-half ounce of boric\\r\\nacid to a pint of boiled water) should be applied on the wound, and for an\\r\\ninch or two around it. Over this lay a thick layer of absorbent cotton or\\r\\nmuslin, bandage all securely with a bandage or adhesive strap, so the\\r\\ndressing cannot slip.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Hand Arteries.]\\r\\n\\r\\nGaping Wounds generally need stitches. These should be put in deep enough\\r\\nto draw the deep edges together. If that is not done, a pocket will be\\r\\nleft where the parts are not together and \"matter\" may form there. Plaster\\r\\nwill not draw the deeper parts of wounds together. They should then be\\r\\ncovered the same way as superficial wounds; of course the wound should be\\r\\nthoroughly cleansed in the same way before the stitches are put in. Such\\r\\nwounds unless they are large, need not be dressed for a day or two, unless\\r\\nthere is soreness or pain. If the wound is sore and throbs it should be\\r\\nredressed immediately. Some discharge will no doubt he found penned in,\\r\\nand needs a drain through which to escape. This does not usually happen,\\r\\nand if it does, the wound was infected (poisoned) and then needs dressing\\r\\nonce or twice a day, and full vent given to any discharge that may be\\r\\npresent. The dressing immediately over the wound should then be thick and\\r\\nsoft so as to absorb the discharge that may be present. The stitches are\\r\\nusually removed in small wounds the third or fourth day. This is easily\\r\\ndone, with a sharp pointed scissors or knife; put one point underneath the\\r\\nstitch next to the knot, cut it off and with the forceps take hold of the\\r\\nknot and pull it out gently. It comes away easily as a rule.\\r\\n\\r\\n[ACCIDENTS AND POISONS 393]\\r\\n\\r\\nTorn Wounds should be trimmed. That is, cut away the torn pieces and then\\r\\nstitch together as for other wounds. Of course all the tissue possible\\r\\nshould be saved and only ragged flesh should be cut away. This would die\\r\\nanyway, and prove a foreign body, and would be very apt to cause pus.\\r\\nThese wounds should be dressed the same way as previously directed.\\r\\n\\r\\nSometimes bleeding may cause trouble. Usually, hot water constantly\\r\\napplied will stop it. Pressing above the part will often stop bleeding. If\\r\\nan artery is cut it will spurt red blood. The artery should be tied and\\r\\npressure made upon the limb above the cut toward the body; or tying the\\r\\nlimb tight. If a finger or toe is cut and bleeds much, press on each side.\\r\\nThe arteries are there. Put the limb high and the head low. Bandaging a\\r\\nlimb tight, beginning at the end, often stops bleeding. Stimulants\\' are\\r\\nsometimes necessary for a time.\\r\\n\\r\\nPunctured Wounds.--From a sharp pointed instrument, nail, etc. The first\\r\\nthing to do is to cleanse the wound thoroughly with hot water and about\\r\\none-half ounce of salt to a pint of water. Keep this up constantly for\\r\\none-half hour. Then if it is from a nail, put on a bread and milk poultice\\r\\nhot, and keep changing it every ten minutes to keep it good and hot. Keep\\r\\nthis going for at least an hour. Salt pork can then be put on and kept on;\\r\\nor a cloth dipped in hot salt water can be applied, and kept on for a few\\r\\nhours when it can be dressed as other wounds are. There should be no\\r\\nthrobbing pain the next day. A wound of this kind should be dressed every\\r\\nday, with great care in the matter of cleanliness. It is lack of\\r\\ncleanliness that usually causes trouble, either the poison that gets into\\r\\nthe wound at the time of injury or that is allowed to get in and infect\\r\\nthe wound afterwards. Clean hands, tools, basins, dressings and boiled\\r\\nwater are essential to a quick healing.\\r\\n\\r\\nRusty Nail Wound, Simple Guard Against Serious Results from.--\"Every\\r\\nlittle while we read of someone who has run a rusty nail in his foot or\\r\\nsome other part of his person, and lockjaw has resulted therefrom. All\\r\\nsuch wounds can be healed without any fatal consequences following them.\\r\\nIt is only necessary to smoke such wounds or any wound or bruise that is\\r\\ninflamed, with burning wood or woolen cloth. Twenty minutes in the smoke\\r\\nwill take the pain out of the worst case of inflammation arising from any\\r\\nwound I ever saw.\" Put on a poultice of bread and milk, changing every\\r\\nfive or ten minutes. After this bind on salt pork and keep on for several\\r\\ndays.\\r\\n\\r\\n[394 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nMOTHERS\\' REMEDIES. 1.

If the iodoform is offensive to some people, you may use the\\r\\nvaselin alone, although the iodoform is known to be one of the best\\r\\nhealing remedies that can be obtained.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Cuts, Turpentine Good in Small Quantities for.--\"For cuts and any open\\r\\nwound pour turpentine in and put a piece of absorbent cotton on and soak\\r\\nwell with the liniment, tie up, and leave it so until dry, then pour on\\r\\nsome more.\" Care should be taken in using turpentine, not to put too much\\r\\non the wound, as it may cause proud flesh in some people; a little of it\\r\\nis very healing and effective.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Cuts, Tincture of Myrrh for Fresh.--\"Use freely of the tincture of\\r\\nmyrrh by saturating a cloth and applying to the parts affected.\" This\\r\\ntincture of myrrh may be purchased at, any drug store, and is a very\\r\\neffectual remedy for fresh wounds of any description. It is slightly\\r\\ncontracting, and has great healing qualities.\\r\\n\\r\\nMOTHERS\\' REMEDIES. 1. Bleeding, Unusual Way to Stop.--\"If fresh, sprinkle\\r\\nfull of black pepper. It will not smart, and is soon healed. If not fresh,\\r\\nclean with a weak solution saleratus and cover while wet with pepper. This\\r\\nhas been tried many times in our home and has never failed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Bleeding, Cobwebs to Stop.--\"Make a pad of cobwebs and apply to cut. I\\r\\nhave never found anything to equal this remedy.\" This simple remedy has\\r\\nbeen known to save many lives, and can always be obtained. As most\\r\\nhousekeepers know; cobwebs are easily found in every home, and perhaps\\r\\nafter reading this remedy they will not seem such a pest as heretofore, if\\r\\nwe stop to think that at some future date our baby\\'s life might be saved\\r\\nby using them.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Bleeding, Powdered Alum and Hot Water Stops.--\"A heaping teaspoonful of\\r\\npowdered alum, placed in a teacup of water will stop the flow of blood in\\r\\nordinary wounds, where no large artery has been cut. This will be found\\r\\nvery beneficial for children, when their finger has been cut and bleeding\\r\\nbadly.\" Alum is something that should always be kept in the home, using it\\r\\nin a case of emergency when there is no time to run to the drug store.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Bleeding, Salt and Flour Successful Remedy for.--\"Equal parts of fine\\r\\nsalt and flour placed on cut. I have seen this tried and it proved\\r\\nsuccessful.\" The salt will stop the bleeding by its astringent action and\\r\\nmixed with flour forms a coating over the cut.\\r\\n\\r\\n5. Bleeding, Boracic Acid Excellent for.--\"Bind up in boracic acid\\r\\npowder.\" The boracic acid is very healing and a good antiseptic, which is\\r\\none of the important things to be attended to in a bad cut or wound.\\r\\n\\r\\n[ACCIDENTS AND POISONS 395]\\r\\n\\r\\n6.--Bleeding, Tobacco Will Stop.--\"Bind in tobacco.\" Very few people know\\r\\nthat the nicotine in tobacco is very healing, and by applying it to a cut,\\r\\nnot only stops the flow of blood, but heals.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHINGS IN THE EAR; Buttons, Beads, etc.--The bent hairpin is good to use\\r\\nfor removing these objects, unless it is too far in. Sometimes the object\\r\\ncan be washed out with a stream of water. This will kill and destroy\\r\\ninsects. A small stream from a pitcher will do, if there is no fountain\\r\\nsyringe handy. Water should not be used for corn, peas or beans, for if\\r\\nthey are not removed the water will cause them to swell up and enlarge. A\\r\\ncompetent person should then be called, but no injury will be done for a\\r\\nfew hours.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGAS from wells, cisterns, mines, illuminating gas and coal gas.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--Fresh pure air. Open all windows in the house and remove\\r\\npatient from a house filled with coal gas. Artificial respiration: Inject\\r\\nsalt enemas; teaspoonful of salt to one pint of warm water.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFITS. (Convulsions).--Loosen all clothing. Put something hard between the\\r\\nteeth to keep the patient from biting his tongue. Allow plenty of sleep\\r\\nafterward.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIN-GROWING TOE-NAILS. Causes.--Pressure from improperly fitting shoes, or\\r\\na wrong way of cutting the nails. The flesh along the nails becomes\\r\\ninflamed. Toe-nails should be cut straight across, and not trimmed too\\r\\nclosely at the corners.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--Wear broad-toed shoes with low heels. The high heels push the\\r\\ntoes against the shoe and besides are unhealthy and dangerous in walking.\\r\\n\\r\\nHot poultices will relieve the inflammation and pain. Soak the toe in hot\\r\\nwater and push the flesh back from the nail. Cotton under the edge and\\r\\ncorner of the nail helps to keep it away. Dust a boric acid powder, mixed\\r\\nwith an equal quantity of starch flour, on the parts. Mennen\\'s borated\\r\\ntalcum powder is good.\\r\\n\\r\\nMOTHER\\'S REMEDY. 1. In-growing Toe-Nail, Popular Remedy for.--\"Shave a\\r\\nlittle common laundry soap and mix with a little cream and pulverized\\r\\nsugar, work to the consistency of salve and apply to the affected part\\r\\nnight and morning. It will take off the proud flesh in about ten days and\\r\\nthen heal. This is a good salve for bed-sores or cuts, that, have dirt in\\r\\nthem, and will also draw out a splinter. To prevent in-growing toe-nails,\\r\\nscrape the center of the nail very thin and cut a V in the top. This will\\r\\nallow the nail to bend and the corners will have a chance to grow up and\\r\\nout. Avoid short shoes and stockings.\" Anyone suffering from this dreaded\\r\\nthing will be willing to try anything that will give relief. The above\\r\\ntreatment is always at hand, and has been known to cure in severe cases.\\r\\n\\r\\n[396 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nFALLS.--If one has had a severe fall and is wholly or partially conscious,\\r\\nmove as little as possible, in case of broken bones.

Choking, Pennyroyal Tea and Lard Relieves.--\"Pennyroyal tea and hog\\'s\\r\\nlard; drink hot.\" The pennyroyal may be purchased at any drug store for\\r\\nten cents. Make a tea of this, then add the hog\\'s lard. As we all know,\\r\\nthat this will produce vomiting and relax the tissues so that any foreign\\r\\nmatter will come out.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Choking, Grease and Meat Common Remedy for.--\"Warm lard, or any kind of\\r\\ngrease, and give the patient. Have seen it used with success.\" The warm\\r\\ngrease will usually cause vomiting, and in that way remove the foreign\\r\\nmatter.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Gullet.--An emetic is good to give if the body cannot be reached\\r\\nwith the hand. Doctors use forceps or another instrument called a probang.\\r\\nPennies will go down into the stomach and pass out through the bowels and\\r\\nusually cause no trouble. Fish bones can generally be reached with the\\r\\nfinger or crochet hook. This is also good for foreign bodies in the nose,\\r\\nsuch as beans.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHINGS IN THE NOSE. Corn, Peas, Beans, Buttons, etc.--Children frequently\\r\\nget such things in their nose and also ears. They should be removed soon\\r\\nand then there will be no harm done. They have been known to remain for\\r\\nyears, and they have been the cause of catarrh. A small curved hair-pin\\r\\nmakes a good instrument to use and is always handy. Also a crochet hook,\\r\\nthough not so good, for it will not bend as well as the hair-pin. The\\r\\nmother should sit facing a window or open door. The child should be placed\\r\\non its back with its head resting between the mother\\'s limbs and an\\r\\nassistant holds the child\\'s hands. Its legs will be hanging down. The\\r\\nlight now shines into the nostril and the bent hair-pin can be slipped\\r\\nover the foreign body and easily hooked out. The head must be held quiet\\r\\nby the mother. The mother can do this herself, with one hand holding the\\r\\nhead quiet and with the other can introduce the hair-pin and remove the\\r\\nobject. But the position of the child must be reversed with the head\\r\\nbetween her knees and the light shining in the nose; or place the child on\\r\\na bench or cradle or buggy, head on a pillow, and to the light. Hold the\\r\\nhead and legs quiet; by kneeling by the child\\'s side, you can easily see\\r\\nthe object and remove it. If they are too far back, they can be pushed\\r\\nover into the throat, but parents should never attempt to remove an object\\r\\nin the nose they cannot see. Sometimes causing sneezing with a feather or\\r\\npepper will expel the object.\\r\\n\\r\\n[ACCIDENTS AND POISONS 397]\\r\\n\\r\\nTREATMENT OF THE DROWNED, SUFFOCATED OR ELECTRICALLY SHOCKED. Accidents,\\r\\netc.--The one action of first importance in the treatment of the drowned,\\r\\nthe suffocated or the electrically shocked is to restore breathing. This\\r\\nmust be done by expelling from the lungs the poison or water which has\\r\\ncaused the trouble, and by establishing artificial respiration. Avoid\\r\\ndelay. One moment may lose or save a life.\\r\\n\\r\\nSchaefer Method of Effecting Artificial Respiration In Case of\\r\\nDrowning.--After an investigation and comparison of the different methods\\r\\nof artificial respiration, Schaefer suggests one which is by far the\\r\\nsimplest and easiest and at the same time one of the most effective and\\r\\nleast injurious to the patient. In describing it he says: \"It consists in\\r\\nlaying the subject in the prone posture, preferably on the ground, with a\\r\\nthick folded garment underneath the chest and epigastrium, (region above\\r\\nthe stomach). The operator puts himself athwart or at the side of the\\r\\nsubject, facing his head (see plate) and places his hands on each side\\r\\nover the lower part of the back (lowest ribs). He then slowly throws the\\r\\nweight of his body forward to bear upon his own arms and this presses upon\\r\\nthe thorax of the subject and forces air out of the lungs. This being\\r\\neffected, he gradually relaxes the pressure by bringing his own body up\\r\\nagain to a more erect position, but without moving his hands.\" These\\r\\nmovements should be repeated regularly at a rate of twelve to fifteen\\r\\ntimes per minute, until normal respiration begins or until hope of its\\r\\nrestoration is abandoned. Some claim there is no hope of restoring\\r\\nrespiration after half an hour of artificial respiration. Others claim\\r\\nthere is a chance of saving the patient even then, and say that artificial\\r\\nrespiration should be kept up for two or three hours.\\r\\n\\r\\n[398 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nTO RESUSCITATE THE DROWNED.--First: Lose no time in recovering the body\\r\\nfrom the water. Always try to restore life; for while ten minutes under\\r\\nthe water is usually the limit, still persons have been resuscitated after\\r\\nbeing under water for thirty or forty minutes. Do not lose time by taking\\r\\nthe body to a place of shelter--operate immediately.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: The Schaefer Position to be Adopted for Effecting\\r\\nArtificial Respiration in Case of Drowning.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[ACCIDENTS AND POISONS 399]\\r\\n\\r\\nSecond: Quickly lay the person prone, face downward with stomach resting\\r\\non a barrel or roll of clothing, so the head will be lower than rest of\\r\\nthe body and the water will run out from the throat and lungs. Wipe dry\\r\\nmouth and nostrils. Wrap the corner of a handkerchief about the forefinger\\r\\nand clear the mouth of all mucus and slimy substance back as far as the\\r\\ntop of the throat. Rip open the clothing on chest and back and keep the\\r\\nface exposed to the air. Separate the jaws and keep them apart with a\\r\\ncork, stone, or knot in a handkerchief.\\r\\n\\r\\nThird: Remove the roll of clothing from underneath the stomach of the\\r\\npatient. Kneel by the side of or across the patient. Place your hands over\\r\\nthe lowest ribs. Lean forward and put your weight straight over the lowest\\r\\nribs. Exert this pressure for three seconds. To count three seconds, say:\\r\\n\"One thousand and one, one thousand and two; one thousand and three,\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFourth: Do not remove the hands from the ribs; but release the pressure\\r\\nfrom the ribs for two seconds, by squatting backward. To count two\\r\\nseconds, say: \"One thousand and one, one thousand and two,\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFifth: Again exert pressure straight over the lowest ribs for three\\r\\nseconds. Alternate thus (three seconds pressure and two seconds release),\\r\\nabout twelve times a minute, until breathing is restored. This method of\\r\\nresuscitation at once expels water and produces the identical results of\\r\\nnormal breathing.\\r\\n\\r\\nSixth: If another person is at hand to assist, let him do everything\\r\\npossible to keep the body warm, by sheltering it from the wind, rubbing\\r\\nhands and soles of feet, making hot applications. Warm the head nearly as\\r\\nfast as the other parts of the body to avoid congestion. Camphor or\\r\\nammonia may be applied to nostrils to excite breathing.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeventh: Do not give up too soon. Any time within two hours you may be on\\r\\nthe point of reviving the patient without there being any sign of it. Send\\r\\nfor a physician as soon as possible after the accident. Prevent friends\\r\\nfrom crowding around the patient and excluding fresh air.\\r\\n\\r\\nAFTER-TREATMENT.--After breathing is restored, remove the patient to a\\r\\nwarm bed where there is free circulation of fresh air. Administer in small\\r\\ndoses stimulants (hot coffee, ginger tea, hot sling) being careful not to\\r\\nlet the patient choke or strangle. There is danger that the patient may\\r\\nsuffer congestion of the lungs and have great difficulty in breathing.\\r\\nWhen this occurs, a large mustard plaster should be placed over the lungs.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHOW TO KEEP FROM DROWNING.--To keep from drowning it is advisable, but not\\r\\nnecessary, to know how to swim. The human body in the water weighs little\\r\\nmore than a pound; so that one finger placed upon a piece of board, an oar\\r\\nor a paddle, will easily keep the head above water, and the feet and the\\r\\nother hand can be used to propel the body toward the shore. It is all\\r\\nimportant for the person in the water to breathe and keep a cool head, and\\r\\nthe mouth closed.\\r\\n\\r\\n[400 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nHOW TO FIND DROWNED PERSONS.--Make a board raft, ten or twelve feet\\r\\nsquare. Cut a round hole in the center, eight or ten inches in diameter.\\r\\nLie down on the raft with the face over the hole, covering the head with a\\r\\ncoat or shawl, to exclude the light. By this contrivance the rays of the\\r\\nlight are concentrated directly under the raft, and objects of any size\\r\\ncan be seen a considerable distance below the surface. Tow the raft over\\r\\nthe place where the drowned person is supposed to be. If the body has just\\r\\ngone under and no raft can be provided at once, dive or drag the bottom\\r\\nwith line and hooks. The important object is to rescue the body at the\\r\\nearliest possible moment. If the body is not rescued, it will rise to the\\r\\nsurface within a week or ten days.\\r\\n\\r\\nThree hundred lives are lost in Michigan every year from drowning. If by\\r\\nstudying and learning how to carry out the directions in this article, you\\r\\ncan be a life saver at some critical moment, the few moments spent in\\r\\ncareful reading will be well repaid. Master the directions so that you\\r\\nwill be able to do everything possible in case of accident.\\r\\n\\r\\nELECTRIC SHOCK, ETC.--In suffocation by smoke or any poisonous gas, as\\r\\nalso by hanging if the neck is not broken, and in suspended breathing from\\r\\neffects of chloroform, hydrate of chloral, or electric shock, remove all\\r\\nobstructions to breathing, instantly loosen or cut apart all neck and\\r\\nwaist bands, taking special pains to keep the head very low, and placing\\r\\nthe body face downward, to prevent closure of the windpipe by the tongue\\r\\nfalling back. Then proceed to induce artificial respiration the same as in\\r\\ndrowning, described above.\\r\\n\\r\\nBATHING IN SEWAGE POLLUTED WATERS IS DANGEROUS.--Cases have been reported\\r\\nwhere typhoid fever has been contracted by bathing in streams below cities\\r\\nand villages. Probably this occurred through accidentally or carelessly\\r\\ntaking the infected water into the mouth. No person should bathe in an\\r\\nordinary stream just below any city or village, or other source of sewage\\r\\nor privy drainage, or in any harbor or lake near the entrance into it of a\\r\\nsewer or the drainage of a privy.\\r\\n\\r\\nPOISONS\\r\\n\\r\\nAn antidote is something given that counteracts poison, such as soda,\\r\\nchalk, magnesia, soap, whiting, milk mixed with magnesia, soda diluted,\\r\\netc., followed by whites of eggs and bland drinks such as flaxseed tea,\\r\\nslippery elm tea, quince seed tea, and sweet or castor oil given after\\r\\nregular antidote.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor Shock, inject hot black coffee into the rectum.\\r\\n\\r\\nEmetic is some medicine given to produce vomiting. The simplest emetic is\\r\\nmustard and warm water. If one does not know what poison has been taken,\\r\\nthe best thing to do is to give an emetic first.\\r\\n\\r\\n[ACCIDENTS AND POISONS 401]\\r\\n\\r\\nMustard.--One-half ounce or four teaspoonfuls for an adult, one to two\\r\\nteaspoonfuls for a child, of mustard to a cup of warm water may be given\\r\\nand repeated every ten or fifteen minutes until free vomiting is produced.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSalt and warm water may be used in the same way. Tickling the throat with\\r\\na finger or a feather produces vomiting.\\r\\n\\r\\nGoose grease, lard, lard drippings, vaselin, all in large amounts.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther medicines: Sulphate of zinc, ten to twenty grains at a dose, in a\\r\\ncup of warm water; or fluid extract of ipecac fifteen to thirty drops, or\\r\\nsyrup of ipecac one teaspoonful.\\r\\n\\r\\nPoisons may be divided into corrosive and irritant.\\r\\n\\r\\nCorrosive poison: This is a poison that is likely to eat or burn through\\r\\norganic tissue immediately.\\r\\n\\r\\nIrritant poison acts more slowly and produces inflammation which later may\\r\\nresult in suppuration and perforation.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn emetic or stomach pump cannot be used in some poisons, such as suphuric\\r\\nacid, because the tissues are quickly injured by the acid and the emetic\\r\\nand pump would only injure farther.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nACONITE.

First, that the tendency in American and Canadian homes is\\r\\nto the return to the good old home remedies that mother and grandmother\\r\\nused so successfully. We have, therefore, tried to choose in this list of\\r\\nover one hundred herbs, the most common ones, ones that could be prepared\\r\\nat home easily and quickly and which would be perfectly safe for the\\r\\naverage person to administer as medicine.\\r\\n\\r\\nSecond, upon a close examination of the herb departments of practically\\r\\nall of the medical works or receipt books sold for family use today we\\r\\ndiscovered that only general information and directions were given. In\\r\\nthis connection, we have endeavored, and we believe successfully, to\\r\\nsupply what other books have neglected,--definite directions for the\\r\\npreparation, dose, etc. Should a physician leave a bottle of medicine at\\r\\nyour home without directions you would not think of using it, and it is\\r\\njust as useless and indiscreet for a young mother to attempt to use herbs\\r\\nfrom the field without explicit directions for their preparation and\\r\\nadministration.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe give below a few important directions for gathering, keeping and\\r\\npreparation of herbs, etc., for reference when using herbs not in this\\r\\nlist. Those in the list are explained under their respective headings.\\r\\n\\r\\nDrying and Preserving Roots, Herbs, Barks, etc.--Gather herbs when the\\r\\nweather is fine, when there is no dew upon them, when the flowers are in\\r\\nfull bloom or the seeds are ripening. By gathering the herbs yourself you\\r\\nare assured of their being fresh although, if living in the city, you can\\r\\npurchase them ready prepared in ounce packages for about five cents at any\\r\\ndrug store. Should you gather them yourself dry them in the shade, after\\r\\nwhich they should be kept from exposure to the air by wrapping up in paper\\r\\nor keeping in paper bags, tied and hung up in the attic or other dry\\r\\nplace. If hanging exposed in your home for a long time watch them that\\r\\nmoths do not gather in them and make their nests.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: BLOODROOT]\\r\\n[Illustration: ELDER FLOWERS]\\r\\n[Illustration: PLEURISY ROOT]\\r\\n[Illustration: SNAKE HEAD]\\r\\n[Illustration: SENECA SNAKE ROOT]\\r\\n[Illustration: GINSENG]\\r\\n[Illustration: MANDRAKE OR MAY-APPLE]\\r\\n[Illustration: WAHOO]\\r\\n[Illustration: SCOURING RUSH]\\r\\n[Illustration: BONESET]\\r\\n[Illustration: ROCK ROSE]\\r\\n[Illustration: TANSY]\\r\\n[Illustration: BEARBERRY]\\r\\n[Illustration: ST. JOHN\\'S WORT]\\r\\n[Illustration: WORMWOOD]\\r\\n[Illustration: TRUE CHAMOMILE]\\r\\n[Illustration: INDIAN TOBACCO OR LOBELIA]\\r\\n[Illustration: CANADA FLEABANE]\\r\\n[Illustration: MARSH MARIGOLD]\\r\\n[Illustration: AMERICAN WORMSEED]\\r\\n[Illustration: ELECAMPANE]\\r\\n[Illustration: MUSTARD]\\r\\n[Illustration: PARTRIDGE BERRY]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[HERB DEPARTMENT 409]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRoots should be dug in the spring when the sap is rising if you wish to\\r\\nmake extract; or they may be gathered in autumn when they have ceased to\\r\\nvegetate. To dry for winter use they should be sliced, dried and kept from\\r\\nthe air.\\r\\n\\r\\nBarks should be stripped when the tree is in full leaf and dried in the\\r\\nshade. The bark of the roots should be taken in the fall, when the sap has\\r\\ndescended.\\r\\n\\r\\nFlowers and Seeds.--Flowers should be gathered when in full bloom and free\\r\\nfrom the dew and should be kept from exposure to the air. Be sure that\\r\\nseeds have fully matured; dry them also in a shady place and keep ready\\r\\nfor use.\\r\\n\\r\\nPreparation of Herbs for Medicine.--There are many different methods of\\r\\npreparing herbs for medicine,--Infusion, Decoction, Fomentation, Ointment,\\r\\nPlaster, Poultice, Powder, Essence, Tincture, etc. Only five of these,\\r\\nPlaster, Poultice, Fomentations, Decoction and Infusion are commonly used.\\r\\nAn infusion is more commonly called \"tea.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nInfusion or Tea, to make.--Usually about one ounce of the herb to a pint\\r\\nof water is used for an infusion. Sometimes cold water is poured over the\\r\\nherb, but the most common method is to pour boiling water over the herb\\r\\nand let stand for a short time, just as you would make common tea for the\\r\\ntable. Sometimes a little sugar may be added to make the tea more\\r\\npalatable. An infusion or tea should be used while fresh.\\r\\n\\r\\nDecoction, to make.--Make same as for infusion and boil for some time,\\r\\njust as you would make coffee.\\r\\n\\r\\nEssence, to make.--Take about an ounce of the essential oil of the herb\\r\\nand dissolve in a pint of alcohol.\\r\\n\\r\\nFomentations, to make.--Dip cloths or heavy towels in the infusion or\\r\\ndecoction, wring out and apply locally to part that you wish to cover.\\r\\n\\r\\nOintments or Salve, to make.--An easy method to make a salve or ointment\\r\\nis to take about eight parts of vaselin or lard or any like substance and\\r\\nadd two parts of the remedy you wish to use. Thus, if you were to make a\\r\\nsulphur salve you would use eight ounces of vaselin and two ounces of\\r\\nsulphur; stir and mix well while hot and when cool you would have a\\r\\nregular sulphur salve or ointment.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlasters, to make.--Bruise the leaves, root, or other part of the plant\\r\\nand place between two pieces of cloth, just as you would a mustard\\r\\nplaster, and apply to the surface you wish to cover.\\r\\n\\r\\n[410 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nPoultices, to make.--Poultices are used to apply heat (moist heat), to\\r\\nsoothe or to draw. Usually a soft substance is used, such as soap and\\r\\nsugar, bread and milk, mustard, etc. Some cause a counter-irritation, some\\r\\ndraw the blood from a congested part and thus relieve pain. In the chapter\\r\\non nursing many different poultices are given with methods of preparing\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n\\r\\nPowder, to make.--The part to be used is crushed, pounded, or ground until\\r\\nit is made very fine. It is best to have substance dry if to be prepared\\r\\nfor powder.\\r\\n\\r\\nSyrups, to make.--After preparing the substance for a tea boil for some\\r\\ntime, then add considerable sugar and stir until all is nicely dissolved.\\r\\nTo each pint of this syrup add one ounce of glycerin and seal up in\\r\\nbottles or cans as you would fruit.\\r\\n\\r\\nTincture, to make.--Take one ounce of the powdered herb and add 4 ounces\\r\\nof water and 12 ounces of alcohol, let stand for two weeks. A dram of\\r\\nglycerin may be added. After standing for two weeks pour off liquid and\\r\\nbottle for use. If it is necessary for you to use a tincture we would\\r\\nadvise that you buy it at a drug store, as it is not often made properly\\r\\nat home. The above is a safe method for making a tincture and would not be\\r\\nespecially strong. Should the herb used have a very weak medicinal power\\r\\none to four ounces of the herb may be used for the above amount of water\\r\\nand alcohol.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nALDER, SPOTTED.--Snapping Hazelnut.

Make a decoction by\\r\\nusing one and one-half ounces of the fresh bark or leaves, boiled in a\\r\\npint of water. The medicine can be bought at any drug store.\\r\\n\\r\\nDiseases, Dose, etc.--For sore mouth, throat, leucorrhea, falling of the\\r\\nwomb and bowel, use the decoction strong locally. It should not cause any\\r\\npain. For falling bowel, use a full strength injection and apply locally\\r\\nwith cloths on the sore bowels.

Some drug stores handle Homeopathic\\r\\nmedicines exclusively.\\r\\n\\r\\nMEDICINES.--Homeopathic medicines should be kept in a dry cool place. Do\\r\\nnot leave them standing open among odors or exposed to bright lights. The\\r\\nfollowing are among those common for home use:\\r\\n\\r\\nList of Remedies.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Aconitum                Colocynthis           Phosphorus\\r\\n      Antimonium crudum       Cuprum metallicum     Pulsatilla\\r\\n      Antimonium tartaricum   Gelsemium             Rhus toxicodendron\\r\\n      Apis                    Hepar Sulphuricum     Sanguinaria\\r\\n      Arnica radix            Hyoscyamus            Sepia\\r\\n      Arsenicum               Ipecacuanha           Silicea\\r\\n      Belladonna              Lycopodium            Spigelia\\r\\n      Bryonia                 Mercurius             Spongia\\r\\n      Chamomilla              Natrum muriaticum     Sulphur\\r\\n      China                   Nux Vomica            Veratrum album\\r\\n      Cina                    Opium\\r\\n      Cinchona (see China)    Phosphoric acid\\r\\n\\r\\nFluid for External Use.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Arnica.                 Calendula.\\r\\n\\r\\nCare of Medicine in the Sick Room.--Use a clean tumbler and when not using\\r\\ncover the tumbler with a small saucer or piece of cardboard. Set it in a\\r\\ncool place and where it is free from odors, as liquid medicines exposed\\r\\nare likely to take up such impurities.\\r\\n\\r\\n[HOMEOPATHY 449]\\r\\n\\r\\nDIRECTIONS FOR USING HOMEOPATHIC MEDICINES.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey are prepared in two forms, Dilutions and Triturations (powdered\\r\\nform). From the triturations tablets are made. When we write \"3X dil.\"\\r\\nthat means 3X dilution; when we write \"3X trit.\" that means 3X\\r\\ntrituration. The 3X means or indicates the strength of the medicine. We\\r\\nhave different dilutions and triturations, as IX, 2X, 3X, 4X, etc.,\\r\\naccording to the strength of the medicine used and we say dil. or trit.,\\r\\nfor dilution or trituration, depending upon the form to be used. Tablets\\r\\nare handier to use than the triturations or powder. In this book when I\\r\\nwrite trituration I shall always expect you to use it in the form of\\r\\ntablets. Instead of giving directions in every disease how to prepare the\\r\\nmedicine, I will give it here.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen you use the medicine in the dilution (liquid) form, you put ten to\\r\\nfifteen drops of the dilution (say the 2X or any one) in a glass half full\\r\\nof water and give one to two teaspoonsful everyone-half to one to two or\\r\\nthree hours, as the case may be, according to the age of the patient, etc.\\r\\nThis is for acute cases.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor chronic cases.--You give medicine three or four times a day, one to\\r\\ntwo teaspoonfuls at a time. When you use it in trituration (tablet) form,\\r\\nyou give one to two tablets at a dose every one-half to one, two or three\\r\\nhours, etc. In chronic cases three or four times a day, one or two\\r\\ntablets.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the beginning of a common cold.--Aconite 2X dil. Put ten drops in a\\r\\nglass half full of water and take two teaspoonsful every one-half hour for\\r\\nthree doses, then every three hours for twelve hours. Tincture of camphor\\r\\nin drop doses is also good.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf throat feels raw and sore.--I give three tablets of Mercurius bin. 2X\\r\\ntrit. (tablet form) in alternation with the Aconite for three doses. Then\\r\\nstop it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLA GRIPPE.--Gelsemium IX dil.

The after treatment was some\\r\\ndressing like simple cerate. If the tumor had attained considerable size,\\r\\nDr. Lombard first used a paste composed of chloride of zinc and pulverized\\r\\nsanguinaria until an eschar was produced and then the same plaster as\\r\\nbefore was applied until the mass sloughed away.

Steele says: \"All a woman has to do in this world is\\r\\ncontained within the duties of a daughter, a sister, a wife, and a\\r\\nmother.\" But how many girls grow to womanhood untaught; enter wifehood in\\r\\nignorance, and assume motherhood wholly unprepared for the duties that are\\r\\nthrust upon her. It would be out of place in a work of this nature, a\\r\\nfamily table book, to take up all the questions involved in such a\\r\\nsubject; we can only leave with you a word of warning. Before puberty the\\r\\ngirl should be taught to lead a life that will make her strong and healthy\\r\\nto prepare her for the coming strain upon her system. Once she has reached\\r\\npuberty parents should remember, above all things, that HEALTH is far more\\r\\nimportant than high grades in school. Do not offer prizes for high marks\\r\\nand otherwise add to the pressure of the present school system. Relieve\\r\\nher of worry, do not add to it. A cheerful mind, plenty of fresh air and\\r\\nsunshine is more important at this period than school work. We have paid\\r\\nspecial attention to \"Causes\" in this department; may we ask you, Mother\\r\\nand Daughter, to read \"CAUSES\" of disease and thus render unnecessary in\\r\\nlater life, drugs, medicines, headache tablets and, perhaps, operations.\\r\\n\\r\\n[490 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Pelvis. It is so called from its resemblance to a basin, is stronger\\r\\nand, more massively constructed than either the skull or chest cavity; it\\r\\nis a bony ring, interposed between the lower end of the spine, which it\\r\\nsupports, and the lower extremities, upon which it rests. It is composed\\r\\nof four bones, the two innominated, (nameless), which bound it on either\\r\\nside and in front, and the Sacrum and Coccyx, which complete it behind.\\r\\nFurther description will be given in the department of Obstetrics. The\\r\\ncavity of the pelvis contains the bladder, the rectum, and some of the\\r\\ngenerative organs peculiar to each sex and some windings of the small\\r\\nintestine; they are partially covered by the peritoneum (lining membrane\\r\\nof the abdominal cavity).\\r\\n\\r\\nAnatomy of the Female Genital Organs.--The external genital organs, to\\r\\nwhich the term vulva is usually given, consist of the mons veneris, labia\\r\\nmajora, labia minora, clitoris, vestibule, meatus urinarius, hymen, fossa\\r\\nnavicularis, fourchette and perineum.\\r\\n\\r\\nMons Veneris.--This is a rounded eminence surmounting the pubic bones, and\\r\\nis composed of fatty tissue, covered by skin and hair.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Labia Majora.--There are two more or less prominent longitudinal folds\\r\\nof cutaneous (pertaining to the skin) tissue, covered by hair and mucous\\r\\nmembrane, which is continuous with the mucous membrane of the genital\\r\\norgans and urinary tract. They join at each extremity, forming the\\r\\nanterior and posterior commissures (uniting together). Between the\\r\\nposterior commissure (union) and the margin of the bowel is a space of\\r\\nabout an inch in extent, the Perineum. It is important to remember this\\r\\npart, for it is often torn in labor, to a greater or less extent.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe labia are the analogue of the scrotum in the male.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Labia Minora.--These are two smaller folds situated within the labia\\r\\nmajora, extending from the clitoris, downward and outward for about one\\r\\nand one-half inches on each side of the vaginal opening. At their\\r\\nconvergence at the clitoris each lip (labium) divides into two folds and\\r\\nthese surround the glans (clitoris) forming its covering (prepuce) above\\r\\nand the bridle (frenum) below. These lips (labia) are composed of mucous\\r\\nmembrane covered by a thin epithelial layer. They contain a network of\\r\\nvessels and numerous large mucous crypts (small sacs or follicles) which\\r\\nsecrete a quantity of (fatty) matter.\\r\\n\\r\\n[WOMAN\\'S DEPARTMENT 491]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Clitoris.--This is an erectile structure, the analogue anatomically of\\r\\nthe cavernous body of the penis, and is an elongated organ partially\\r\\ncovered by the anterior extremities of the labia minora and connected on\\r\\neach side with the rami (slender process of the bone) of the pubic bones\\r\\nand the ischia (two bones) by a band. The clitoris is surmounted by a\\r\\nsmall tubercle (a small nodule) of spongy erectile tissue, the \"glans\\r\\nclitoris,\" Two cavernous bodies of erectile tissue enclosed in dense\\r\\nfibrous tissue compose the body of the organ.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Vestibule.--This is the smooth surface of triangular form situated\\r\\nbetween the clitoris and the entrance to the vagina. The labia minora\\r\\nbound it on either side. It contains the opening of the urethra.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Hymen is a thin fold of mucous membrane of half moon in shape\\r\\n(semi-lunar) and is spread across the lower opening of the vagina.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Glands of Bartholin are small oblong bodies, two in number, situated\\r\\non each side of the commencement of the vagina above the deep fascia band\\r\\nlike tissue. Each gland has a single duct and by this duct opens the inner\\r\\nsurface of the adjacent labia minoris just external to the hymen. They are\\r\\nmade up of mucous glands and a colorless tenacious fluid is secreted by\\r\\nthem, which lubricates the vagina. These glands sometimes become diseased.\\r\\nHence the description.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Vagina.--This is a membranous canal and extends from the vulva to the\\r\\nuterus (womb) and connects the external and internal organs of generation.\\r\\nIt is four to six inches in length, the anterior wall being from one to\\r\\ntwo inches shorter than the posterior. It lies in the cavity of the pelvis\\r\\nin front of the rectum, behind the bladder and follows first the line of\\r\\naxis of the cavity of the pelvis, and afterwards the axis of the outlet.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe vagina consists of an internal mucous lining (membrane) continuous\\r\\nabove with the mucous membrane lining the womb and below with the covering\\r\\nof the labia majora. The next covering (inward) is a muscular coat\\r\\nconsisting of two layers--an external longitudinal and an internal\\r\\ncircular. There is a layer of erectile tissue between the muscular coat\\r\\nand mucous lining. The lower end of the vagina is surrounded by a band of\\r\\nstriped muscular fibers comprising the sphincter muscle of the vagina\\r\\n(sphincter vagina).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe internal organs of generation, more commonly called the pelvic organs.\\r\\nThese comprise the womb, fallopian tubes and ovaries.\\r\\n\\r\\n[492 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe womb is the organ of pregnancy, and receives the fruitful egg (ovum),\\r\\nsupports it during its development and expels it at the time of labor\\r\\n(parturition). In form it is pear-shaped, weighs from 12 drams to 3 ounces\\r\\nand is situated in the pelvic cavity, between the bladder and the rectum,\\r\\nwith its base upwards and its apex, smaller end downward. Its upper broad\\r\\nextremity is called the fundus--base of the organ, and the lower,\\r\\nconstricted, narrowed portion is called the Cervix (neck or constricted\\r\\nportion). The body of the womb gradually becomes narrower from the fundus\\r\\nto the Cervix.\\r\\n\\r\\nIts anterior surface is covered on its upper three-quarters by the\\r\\nperitoneum, while the lower fourth is connected with the bladder. The\\r\\nperitoneum covers the whole of the posterior surface. The womb is held up\\r\\n(suspended) in the pelvis by ligaments; two anterior, womb and bladder\\r\\n(utero-vesical), two posterior, womb-sacral (utero-sacral), two lateral\\r\\nbroad ligaments, and two round ligaments. The womb sacral (utero-sacral)\\r\\nwhich holds the womb well up in the hollow of the sacrum and the round\\r\\nligaments which keep the womb well forward enter most actively into the\\r\\nsupport of the womb. The round ligaments are strong muscular fibrous cords\\r\\nand serve to hold the womb forward. When pregnancy exists they increase in\\r\\nsize with the womb, and keep the fundus forward in its excursion upwards\\r\\ninto the abdominal cavity, and after confinement, become smaller with the\\r\\nwomb, guiding the womb back again to its regular position. The broad\\r\\nligaments are little more than reflection of the peritoneum serving to\\r\\nsupport the vessels that nourish, as they go to and from the womb.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe womb has three coats, enclosing a central cavity. This cavity of the\\r\\nwomb is small by comparison with the size of the organ and it communicates\\r\\nwith the Fallopian tubes by two minute openings at each side of the body,\\r\\nand with the vagina below, through the mouth or opening of the womb.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe external coat of the womb is called servos, derived from the\\r\\nperitoneum; the middle or muscular coat, which forms the chief substance\\r\\nof the womb, consists of bundles of unstripped muscular fibers intermixed,\\r\\nwith loose connective tissue, blood vessels, lymphatics and nerves; the\\r\\ninternal or mucous coat is continuous through the fringed extremity of the\\r\\nfallopian tubes, with the peritoneum, and through the mouth of the womb\\r\\n(os uteri) with the mucous membrane of the vagina. This mucous membrane is\\r\\nlined in the body of the womb by epithelium arrayed in columns (Columnar\\r\\nEpithelium) which loses its ciliated (eye-lash) movement character during\\r\\npregnancy. In the lower half of the Cervix, the epithelium (this kind of\\r\\ncell lines all canals having communication with the external air) is of\\r\\nthe stratified (arranged in layers) variety. The appendages of the womb\\r\\nare the fallopian tubes, the ovaries and their ligaments and the  round\\r\\nligaments. The fallopian tubes convey the ova (eggs) from the ovaries to\\r\\nthe cavity of the womb. They are two in number, one on each side, situated\\r\\nin the free border of the broad ligaments and extend from each horn, an\\r\\nexcrescence of the womb that looks like a horn, of the womb outward to the\\r\\nsides of the pelvis; each is about five inches in length, and has a small\\r\\ncanal beginning at the womb in a very small opening called the internal\\r\\nmouth (ostium internum). This canal gradually widens to its ending, the\\r\\nabdominal mouth (ostium abdominal) by which it communicates with the\\r\\nperitoneal cavity, the timbrae. A series of fringe-like processes\\r\\nsurround this mouth or opening and this farther end is known as the\\r\\nfimbriated extremity. The tube has three coats, serous or external or\\r\\nperitoneal; the middle or muscular, continuous with that of the womb, and\\r\\nan internal or mucous coat continuous also with the lining of the womb and\\r\\nperitoneum (covered with ciliated Columnar Epithelium).\\r\\n\\r\\n[WOMAN\\'S DEPARTMENT 493]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Ovaries.--They are analogues, anatomically, of the testes in the male.\\r\\nThey are two egg-shaped bodies situated one on each side of the womb on\\r\\nthe posterior aspect of the broad ligament, below and behind the fallopian\\r\\ntubes; each is connected by its anterior margin to the broad ligament;\\r\\ninternally to the womb by the ovarian ligament, externally to the\\r\\nfringe-like extremity of the fallopian tubes by a short cord-like\\r\\nligament. They are white in color; about one and one-half inches long,\\r\\nthree-quarters of an inch wide and one-third of an inch thick and weigh\\r\\nabout two drams each.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ovarian ligament extends from the inner side of the ovary to the\\r\\nsuperior angle of the (Uterus) womb. The round ligaments, two in number,\\r\\nare about five inches long and are situated between the layers of the\\r\\nbroad ligament, one on each side of the womb in front and below the\\r\\nfallopian tube. They pass forward and outward from the womb through the\\r\\ninternal abdominal ring, along the groin canal and out at the external\\r\\nabdominal ring.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have given a lengthy description of these organs; I think it will repay\\r\\na careful reading. To understand a disease one should understand the\\r\\norgans that are subject to the disease.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCAUSES OF DISEASES OF WOMEN.\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Child says among primitive people, woman is notoriously free from many\\r\\nof the diseases to which her sister in our present-day civilization is\\r\\nespecially prone. As we ascend the scale of civilization, departing from a\\r\\nnatural and adopting an artificial mode of life we find nature enacts due\\r\\npenalties for the transgression of her laws. The female among savage\\r\\ntribes has every advantage and opportunity to develop physical perfection,\\r\\nand her endurance suffers little, if any, by comparison with the male. How\\r\\ndifferent is our modern system when the young girls are sent early to\\r\\nschool and subjected daily to long hours of study, often in badly\\r\\nventilated class-rooms, for nine months in the year, and this at the time\\r\\nof puberty, one of the most important periods of their life when they need\\r\\nplenty of out-door exercise. Surely, as Goodell says, \"If woman is to be\\r\\nthus stunted and deformed to meet the ambitious intellectual demands of\\r\\nthe day, if her health must be sacrificed upon the altar of her education,\\r\\nthe time may come when to renew the worn out stock of the Republic it will\\r\\nbe necessary for our young men to make matrimonial excursions into lands\\r\\nwhere educational theories are unknown.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n[494 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nMenstruation.--Many of the disorders of menstruation are due to\\r\\ncarelessness and neglect of this function. There should be rest of both\\r\\nbody and mind at this time, and especially at puberty. Rest is seldom\\r\\nallowed, but the daily routine is gone through, regardless of what may\\r\\nhappen.\\r\\n\\r\\nDress.--The way the abdomen is now constricted, and this is now a\\r\\nprominent feature of women\\'s mode of dress, is without doubt an important\\r\\npredisposing cause in female diseases. This contraction of the normal size\\r\\nof the cavity of the abdomen, with the subsequent compression and\\r\\ndisplacement of its organs, must of necessity produce dynamic (powerful)\\r\\nchanges in the pelvis that cannot be otherwise than injurious to the\\r\\npelvic organs. Tight lacing or any lacing, aside from the remote effects\\r\\nso unnatural a practice must produce, causes marked atrophy (dwindling) of\\r\\nthe abdominal muscles. These are often so weakened that during labor they\\r\\ncannot properly assist the uterus (womb) in effecting delivery, and as a\\r\\nresult instrumental interference, with its attendant dangers becomes\\r\\nnecessary.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrevention of Conception.--This is a very common practice among civilized\\r\\nwomen, and it has a most destructive effect upon the pelvic organs, as\\r\\nwell as upon the general system.\\r\\n\\r\\nCriminal abortion.--The chief danger from the criminal interruption of\\r\\npregnancy is sepsis (absorption of poisons) into the system. This may be\\r\\nacute in character and have a fatal termination, or chronic in nature,\\r\\nleading to permanent injury of the womb and fallopian tubes, sterility and\\r\\nchronic invalidism.\\r\\n\\r\\nChild birth.--Pelvic diseases frequently come from injuries received\\r\\nduring labor.\\r\\n\\r\\nVenereal diseases.--Dr. Child says, \"Syphilis exerts its usual baneful\\r\\ninfluence, but gonorrhoea is responsible for more pathological (diseased)\\r\\nlesions (conditions) in the female pelvis than any other one factor. Its\\r\\nattack, if not resulting in ultimate loss of life, always leaves the\\r\\ntissue in an impaired condition, from which resolution (returning to\\r\\nnatural condition) is rare. It is doubtful if a woman once infected with\\r\\ngonorrhoea ever recovers from its ravages. As a cause of sterility its\\r\\npower is beyond estimation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nINFLAMMATION OF THE VULVA.--(Vulvitis).--An acute or chronic inflammation\\r\\nof the vulva (external genitals) either from a specific, like gonorrhoea,\\r\\nor non-specific cause.\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses.--Veit says, \"Seventy-five per cent of the cases are caused by\\r\\ngonorrhoea.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOther Causes.--Accumulation and decomposition of discharges from the womb\\r\\nand vagina, inflammation of the inner lining of the womb and of the\\r\\nvagina. Foul, putrid discharges from neglected supports (pessaries) and\\r\\ntampons in the vagina; sloughings from cancer may act as exciting causes.\\r\\nContact with ammoniacal and sugar urines has a similar effect.\\r\\n\\r\\n[WOMAN\\'S DEPARTMENT 495]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Infants.--It is usually due to want of cleanliness in failing to remove\\r\\ndecomposing urine and feces. Mothers often allow soiled, foul smelling\\r\\ndiapers to remain for a long time on the baby.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms and Condition of the Parts.--In the acute stage the mucous\\r\\nmembrane around the opening of the vagina is red, swollen, painful and\\r\\nbathed in pus. The glands in the groin and glands of Bartholin are usually\\r\\nenlarged and tender. The glands of Bartholin and those around the urethra\\r\\nmay become infected and fill with pus. The fatty glands of the labia\\r\\nmajora are also sometimes affected and then appears the disease called\\r\\nFollicular Vulvitis (in the chronic stage secretion is abundant). The\\r\\nparts feel hot and there is more or less burning and itching. Walking\\r\\nmakes the trouble worse, due to rubbing of the parts. Passing of urine\\r\\nincreases the distress.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the disease is caused by gonorrhoea it is more extensive and involves\\r\\nthe vagina, urethra, the glands around the urethra and glands of\\r\\nBartholin. This gland infection frequently results in an abscess.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--In the acute form the patient should go to bed and remain\\r\\nthere for some time. The parts should be kept constantly moist with a wet\\r\\nantiseptic dressing, listerine, hot water, etc., applied to the vulva and\\r\\nkept there.\\r\\n\\r\\n1. If there is much pain the following solution may be used:\\r\\n\\r\\n    Acetate of lead      1 dram\\r\\n    Laudanum           1/2 ounce\\r\\n\\r\\nWater enough for six ounces.\\r\\n\\r\\nMix and apply constantly with sterile cloths.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. For chronic form Dr. Child says, \"The vulva should be shaved, thoroughly\\r\\ncleansed and a mild ointment applied daily thereafter,\" such as:\\r\\n\\r\\n    Salicylic acid     20 grains\\r\\n    Oxide of zinc       2 drams\\r\\n    Petrolatum      enough for 1 ounce\\r\\n\\r\\nMix and make an ointment and apply daily.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf it is due to irritating discharges that cannot be checked, cleanse the\\r\\nparts thoroughly and use the Zinc ointment to protect.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nITCHING OF THE VULVA.--Vulvae or Pruritus.--This intense itching is the\\r\\ncharacteristic symptom. With the itching there is more or less swelling of\\r\\nthe parts and extreme nervous irritability.\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses.--This is doubtful; some think it is a purely nervous condition.\\r\\n\\r\\nParts irritable.--The upper angle of the labia majora and the mons veneris\\r\\nare the usual locations. The skin is inflamed thickened, raw, from the\\r\\ncontinual scratching.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--The itching and burning are almost unbearable at times,\\r\\nbeginning most often around the clitoris, coming in paroxysms and made\\r\\nworse by warmth and motion.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn chronic cases the skin is a little thickened and looks dull and dry and\\r\\nis covered with small cracks and scratches, the result of the patient\\'s\\r\\nefforts to stop the itching.\\r\\n\\r\\n[496 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--Systematic, general tonic treatment. Diabetes, gout,\\r\\nirritating discharges from the vagina and rectum should be removed. Pin\\r\\nworms and highly acid urine sometimes cause it in children. Internally the\\r\\nbromides to quiet the nerves and arsenic to build up the system should be\\r\\ngiven.\\r\\n\\r\\nLocal.--Strong solutions of corrosive sublimate (1 to 1000), nitrate of\\r\\nsilver, tincture of iodine, and cocaine ointment give temporary relief.\\r\\n\\r\\nSometimes an operation is necessary.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCYSTS OF THE VULVA.--A cyst is a cavity containing fluid and surrounded by\\r\\na covering (capsule). The duct (canal) of the gland of Bartholin, situated\\r\\nin the labia majora, sometimes closes and the secretions of the gland are\\r\\nnot cast out, thus forming the cyst.\\r\\n\\r\\nCause.--The closing is nearly always the result of gonorrhea.\\r\\n\\r\\nCondition.--The cyst is formed in the duct, the gland itself being\\r\\naffected rarely. It contains a thin sticky mucus. If the cyst arises in\\r\\nthe gland, the swelling is more deeply situated. These cysts may be\\r\\nattacked with an acute inflammation and finally pus is formed in them, and\\r\\na very painful abscess is the result,\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--There are no symptoms except from the size of the swelling\\r\\nunless an abscess occurs. Then there is an acute local pain, quite tender\\r\\non pressure, and often high fever.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--If the cyst is large it should be removed, especially if it\\r\\ncauses annoyance. If it becomes inflamed, rest in bed and cold\\r\\napplications are indicated. If it goes on to an abscess, a free cut should\\r\\nbe made, the abscess scraped and good drainage given. Sometimes it is best\\r\\nto use pure carbolic acid in the walls of the cyst.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nINFLAMMATION OF THE VAGINA, (Vaginitis).--Vaginitis is an inflammation of\\r\\nthe mucous membrane of the vagina.\\r\\n\\r\\nVarieties.--l. Catarrhal or simple 2. granular; 3. gonorrheal; 4.\\r\\ndiphtheritic, and 5. senile.\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Catarrhal or simple form.--This is the most usual form. There is a\\r\\ngeneral redness of the membrane with swelling and increased secretion.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Granular.--This is an advanced stage of the simple type, and is due to\\r\\nlong continued or repeated attacks.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Gonorrheal form.--Is due to infection by the gonococcus of Neisser (due\\r\\nto gonorrhea). This form is hardest to cure and may continue for years or\\r\\nlife, The infection may extend to the womb, fallopian tubes and peritoneal\\r\\ncavity and produce inflammation of the womb (endometritis) pus in the\\r\\ntubes, (pyosalpinx) and peritoneal cavity. This is more common than even\\r\\nsome physicians realize.\\r\\n\\r\\n[WOMAN\\'S DEPARTMENT 497]\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Diphtheritic--Due to diphtheria, not frequent.\\r\\n\\r\\n5. Senile type.--This comes only after the change of life.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--There is pain in the lower abdomen. Passing of urine is\\r\\nfrequent and is attended with smarting and burning pain. There is a\\r\\nfeeling of heat and burning in the vagina, and a copious discharge of\\r\\nmucus and pus. In the gonorrheal variety the urinary disturbances are most\\r\\nmarked.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn gonorrheal variety the symptoms date from a distinct onset, last\\r\\nlonger, do not yield so rapidly to treatment, and complications, such as\\r\\nenlarged glands in the groin and in the vulva and vagina, inflammation of\\r\\nthe lining of the womb and fallopian tubes, inflammation of the bladder,\\r\\noften make their appearance early.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment (in acute cases).--Rest in bed and prolonged vaginal injections\\r\\nof a solution of corrosive sublimate (1 to 4000 strength) three times a\\r\\nday. If the gonorrheal poison is present in the pus, the walls of the\\r\\nvagina, cervix and cervical canal should be dried and thoroughly painted\\r\\nwith a twenty per cent solution of nitrate of silver. The patient should\\r\\nbe in the knee-chest position for this treatment.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn chronic cases the gonorrhea poison (gonococcus) is found most\\r\\nfrequently just behind the posterior lip of the cervix and here the silver\\r\\nsolution should be applied very thoroughly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nVAGINISMUS.--This is a painful reflex muscular contraction of the vaginal\\r\\norifice, and is most often observed in patients of a nervous and sensitive\\r\\ntemperament. Treatment.--Any local cause of irritation should be removed.\\r\\nIf there is no local irritation, the opening should be dilated under an\\r\\nanesthetic. Tonics, exercise, and a complete change of scene are\\r\\nbeneficial.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDISEASES OF THE CERVIX.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTEAR OF THE CERVIX (Laceration).--This is a tear in the lower part of the\\r\\ncervix. There may be one or more. The left one-sided tear is the usual\\r\\nform. Next comes the tear on both sides (bilateral). Tears on front and\\r\\nbehind are not frequent. Tears are found in about thirty per cent of women\\r\\nwho have had children.\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses.--The majority of cases are caused by labor, and is due to a cervix\\r\\nthat is not perfectly dilated. Very hurried, quick labors cause it\\r\\nsometimes, but the greatest injuries are due to the various operations for\\r\\ndelivering the child through a cervix that is not fully dilated.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms. Immediate and remote.--On the immediate, when the tear is\\r\\nsevere, there is bleeding; later, sub-involution, that is, the womb does\\r\\nnot return to its normal size and weight.\\r\\n\\r\\nRemote symptoms.--Leucorrhea, thick and mucus in character; profuse\\r\\nmenstruation and inability to become pregnant. When the tear has extended\\r\\nthrough the internal opening the woman win not be able to carry the child\\r\\nto full term, even if she becomes pregnant.\\r\\n\\r\\n[498 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--Tampons of ichthyol (ten per cent), mixed with glycerin,\\r\\nintroduced twice a week against the cervix and permitted to remain\\r\\nforty-eight hours will often afford relief.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tear should be repaired after child-birth, if possible. If not then,\\r\\nand if it does not heal, it should be repaired later when the tear extends\\r\\nthrough the internal (opening) or in case of extensive raw surface on the\\r\\ncervix.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nINFLAMMATION OF THE CERVIX.--This is an inflammation of the mucous\\r\\nmembrane lining the canal of the cervix (cervical canal), known as\\r\\nEndocervicitis; it may be acute or chronic. The acute form is seen most\\r\\noften as a part of a general infection involving both womb and cervix, and\\r\\nwill be described later. The chronic form is a very common condition and\\r\\nit is difficult to treat.\\r\\n\\r\\nCause.--Injury and tear of the cervix.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--Leucorrhea, profuse and frequent menstruation, pain in the back\\r\\nand loins. On examination a string of thick mucus is seen at the external\\r\\nopening (os) of the cervix; and of women who have borne children there are\\r\\nusually signs of tear and rawness of the cervix present; (Endometritis\\r\\nusually produces a thin watery discharge, while gonorrhea produces a\\r\\nthick, pus-like discharge).\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--Hot vaginal douches, containing one dram of sulphate of zinc\\r\\nto one pint of water, used every night for ten minutes. Hot water with\\r\\nwitch-hazel, about four drams to the pint, is also good. Tincture of\\r\\niodine applied locally twice each month. White oakbark tea used as an\\r\\ninjection once a day for this trouble; also good for vaginitis.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nINFLAMMATION OF THE LINING OF THE WOMB. Endometritis.--Endometritis is an\\r\\ninflammation of the lining membrane of the womb, with a tendency to extend\\r\\nto the lining membrane of the fallopian tubes and to the peritoneum. These\\r\\nare the acute and chronic varieties.\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses.--It may occur during an acute skin disease eruption, like that of\\r\\nscarlet fever, and occasionally upon exposure to cold during menstruation.\\r\\nThe most frequent exciting causes are the microorganisms, like the\\r\\ngonorrhea poison, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nAcute Variety.--The whole mucous lining is inflamed. In severe cases the\\r\\nwhole mucous lining is destroyed and the deeper muscular tissues of the\\r\\nwomb are invaded.\\r\\n\\r\\nGonorrheal Variety. Symptoms.--There is general pain in the lower bowel\\r\\nregion, in spells at first, later constant, with rapid rise of temperature\\r\\nand pulse. A purulent (pus) discharge appears early from the cervix,\\r\\nusually about the second day, and difficult and burning passing of urine\\r\\nare early symptoms. There is inflammation of the vagina accompanying it in\\r\\nabout fifteen per cent of the cases, while inflammation of the fallopian\\r\\ntubes, pus in the tubes, and local peritonitis are common results.\\r\\n\\r\\n[ WOMAN\\'S DEPARTMENT 499]\\r\\n\\r\\nMOTHER\\'S REMEDY. Inflammation of the Womb. 1. A Good Tonic for.--\"For\\r\\ninflammation of the uterus or ovaries try a hot sitz bath every day for a\\r\\nweek, and then every other day. In case of hemorrhage this bath is\\r\\ninvaluable, and will relieve when all other means have failed.

Subsequently vaginal\\r\\ndouches (1 to 5000) corrosive sublimate solution followed by a salt\\r\\nsolution, one dram of salt to a pint of water, should be given for at\\r\\nleast one week. Keep the bowels open.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSEPTIC PUERPERAL ENDOMETRITIS.--This is an inflammation of the inner\\r\\nlining of the womb that occurs after child-birth during the first few\\r\\nweeks, and is due to a poison.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--The attack usually begins with a chill, preceded by a regular\\r\\nincrease of the temperature and pulse. The face looks flushed at first,\\r\\nbut it soon becomes pale and the patient has an anxious look, as the\\r\\ndisease goes on. There is very little pain, if any. The discharge that\\r\\nalways follows labor is diminished or stops and has no odor, if there is\\r\\nany discharge.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe death rate is from five to twenty-five per cent.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--Never scrape out (curette) the womb for this disease. The womb\\r\\nshould be washed out with a hot salt solution, one teaspoonful of salt to\\r\\none pint of water, and then packed with ten per cent iodoform gauze. This\\r\\nsolution should also be injected hot into the rectum and frequently. The\\r\\nbowels should move freely, and if necessary injections may be given for\\r\\nthat purpose.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe strength must be kept up by a liquid diet. Milk, brandy and\\r\\nstrychnine, if necessary; 1/100 of a grain of strychnine can be given\\r\\nevery four hours. Milk should be given every half hour, about two ounces\\r\\nat one time: or more if it agrees well.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe gauze should be removed gradually, beginning on the third day and\\r\\nending on the ninth day.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this disease the interior of the womb is smooth and contains no broken\\r\\ndown or foreign tissue. In the next disease, Putrid Endometritis, it is\\r\\nfar different, for this is caused by the presence of dead material, such\\r\\nas parts of the after-birth, left in after labor, or sloughing tumors.\\r\\nThis material becomes putrid (rotten), and thus causes the disease called\\r\\n\"Putrid Endometritis.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n[500 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nPUTRID ENDOMETRITIS.--An inflammation of the inner lining of the womb\\r\\ncaused by putrid (rotten), decaying material.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--A chill is sometimes present at the beginning. The fever is\\r\\nhigh, pulse bounds and feels hard and strong, the face is flushed but\\r\\nthere is little or no pain. The discharge from the womb, unless it is\\r\\nblocked by a clot, is foul smelling. The flow after childbirth is scanty,\\r\\nsometimes suppressed. The womb and ovaries are not very tender.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--The first thing to do, of course, is to get the dead material,\\r\\nsuch as parts of an after-birth, clots, shreds, etc., out of the womb, and\\r\\nthen scrape the rough surfaces. This must be done carefully and with\\r\\nperfectly clean tools and liquids of every kind. Then wash the womb\\r\\nthoroughly with the hot salt solution. One teaspoonful of salt to one pint\\r\\nof boiled water. After this pack the womb with ten per cent iodoform\\r\\ngauze, which may be bought in this strength. Remove this from the womb\\r\\nabout the third to the ninth day. The bowels should be kept open.\\r\\n\\r\\nDiet.--Should be of milk or at least of liquids only. The patient can be\\r\\ngiven whisky or brandy and 1/60 grain of strychnine every four hours if\\r\\nneeded.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMALIGNANT DISEASES OF THE WOMB.--Cancer or carcinoma is a malignant\\r\\ndisease of the neck (cervix) of the womb.\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses.--The immediate cause is not yet known. Tears and erosions\\r\\n(scraping off and making raw) are supposed to act as direct causes.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--Bleeding is the early and very important symptom. After the\\r\\nchange of life (menopause) is over if bleeding occurs and continues it is\\r\\na very bad sign and the womb should be examined immediately. Later, a\\r\\nwatery bloody discharge appears, with pain, loss of weight and general\\r\\nweakness. Pain is not an early symptom. It appears when the disease has\\r\\nspread to the nearby tissue.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--The only thing to do is to operate and the earlier the better.\\r\\nThe womb and all its belongings should be removed. If this is done early\\r\\nit is very successful. If the case is too far advanced, the only thing to\\r\\ndo is to make the patient as comfortable as possible.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the pain, morphine or opium should be given.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the discharge, hot water and corrosive sublimate (1 to 2000) is the\\r\\nstrength to be used. This should be used daily as an injection into the\\r\\nvagina.\\r\\n\\r\\nCancer of the Body of the Womb is found in only about two per cent of womb\\r\\ncancers.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--An early operation is then necessary. The chances of obtaining\\r\\na cure if operation is done is better even than in cancer of the neck of\\r\\nthe womb. There is less chance for the adjoining structures to be affected\\r\\nso early and readily.\\r\\n\\r\\n[ WOMAN\\'S DEPARTMENT 501]\\r\\n\\r\\nFIBROID TUMORS OF THE WOMB or Fibromata, Frequency.--Some observers state\\r\\nthat twenty to forty per cent of all women over thirty-five years have one\\r\\nor more of these tumors. They are not malignant. They are more common in\\r\\nwomen who are sterile, unable to become pregnant. They appear early in\\r\\nlife and attack all classes. They appear oftener in the body of the womb\\r\\nthan in the neck. When in the body of the womb the back wall is the common\\r\\nsite. A covering of loose fibrous tissue surrounds the growth. Few blood\\r\\nvessels appear in the tumor, nourishment being received from the\\r\\nsurrounding tissues. Their growth is slow, except during pregnancy, when\\r\\nthey grow rapidly. There are three varieties named according to their\\r\\nlocation and the structure covering: or surrounding them. 1. Interstitial;\\r\\n2. sub-mucus; 3. sub-peritoneal or sub-serous.\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Interstitial.--They are in the substance of the womb wall. They are\\r\\nusually many and vary in size.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Sub-mucus (under the mucous membrane).--They project into the cavity of\\r\\nthe womb, are covered by mucous membrane and are attached to the womb by a\\r\\nbroad base or pedicle. This is sometimes cut off spontaneously, and then\\r\\nthe tumor is expelled from the womb.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Sub-peritoneal.--They are under the peritoneum, which forms its outer\\r\\ncover.\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses.--Are not known. They are more frequent between thirty and forty.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--Difficult monthly sickness, too much blood flowing from the\\r\\nwomb, unable to become pregnant, sometimes, and abortion. Bleeding comes\\r\\nmore from the sub-mucus variety generally. Pain is caused by the size and\\r\\nweight and by pressure upon the bladder, rectum and the nerves. Death\\r\\nrarely results except from the complications.\\r\\n\\r\\nMOTHER\\'S REMEDY. 1. Ulcers of the Womb, Common Wood Cactus for.--\"Common\\r\\nwood cactus tea. Take wineglassful three times a. day.\" Should remove all\\r\\nthorns, chop fine and boil in sufficient water; add gin to make dose more\\r\\npleasant.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--Operation is needed when the symptoms are pressing. The\\r\\nsub-mucus variety may make an early operation necessary on account of\\r\\ntheir location.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms Calling for an Operation.--Size of the tumor; from the pressure\\r\\nsymptoms; persistent bleeding from the womb. Sometimes it is necessary to\\r\\nremove the entire womb, especially in the interstitial variety, for the\\r\\nwalls of the womb may be filled with the tumors.\\r\\n\\r\\n[502 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nSUBINVOLUTION OF THE WOMB.--This simply means that the womb, after\\r\\nmiscarriage or child-birth, fails to return to its normal size and weight.\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses.--This is frequently due to getting up too soon after labor.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--Menstruation or too much flow of blood (menorrhagia), dull,\\r\\nheavy feeling in the pelvis, backache or leucorrhea.\\r\\n\\r\\nResults.--The womb frequently becomes misplaced.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--Proper supports should be put in after the womb has been\\r\\nplaced in its proper position.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf seen early enough some cases can be cured by tampons of ichthyol used\\r\\nthree times a week and prolonged hot water injections at bed time. Cotton\\r\\nsoaked in ichthyol and glycerin are frequently of benefit three times a\\r\\nweek used as a tampon. The patient should not be on her feet much, or be\\r\\nactive. Witch-hazel water can be added to the hot water injection if so\\r\\ndesired.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDISEASES OF THE FALLOPIAN TUBES.--These are named after their discoverer,\\r\\nFallopian, an Italian anatomist. These tubes begin at the part of the body\\r\\nof the womb that extends out like a horn. This is on the sides near the\\r\\ntop of the body of the womb. They are two in number and extend outward on\\r\\neach side for about four inches; each end forms a fringe or finger shape\\r\\nto catch the egg, as it emerges from the ovary. Through the center there\\r\\nis a tube or canal, and the inner lining of the womb continues on and\\r\\nlines this canal, the mucous membrane of the Fallopian tubes. When this\\r\\nlining or membrane becomes inflamed it is called Salpingitis or\\r\\nInflammation of the Fallopian tubes. Salpingitis is derived from two\\r\\nwords: Salping, meaning tube; ltis, meaning inflammation; Fallopian was\\r\\nthe discoverer. Thus we have Salping(x)itis, or Inflammation of the\\r\\nFallopian tubes. Unfortunately in medical description it is generally\\r\\ncalled Salpingitis.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSALPINGITIS. Inflammation of the Fallopian Tubes.--It may be either acute\\r\\nor chronic in character.\\r\\n\\r\\nCondition.--The tissues of the tubes become swollen when the inflammation\\r\\nruns into the pus stage; the finger-shaped end (outer end) is usually\\r\\nclosed by adhesions, the pus accumulates in the tube and we have pus in\\r\\nthe tube, or what is technically called [pyo. (pus) Salpinx (tube)]\\r\\nPyosalpinx. In long standing cases the pus is absorbed or degenerates into\\r\\na thin watery fluid, forming watery fluid in the tube or [hydro (water)\\r\\nSalpinx (tube)]--hydrosalpinx.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tube may become attached to neighboring organs. The pus or fluid may\\r\\ndrain occasionally into the womb and vagina. It may go into the bladder or\\r\\nbowels.\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses.--It is usually caused by invading germs from the womb. Gonorrhea\\r\\nis the cause of the most cases.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptom.--This disease follows the same kind of an infection in the womb\\r\\nand vagina; the patient complains of pain in the region of the tube, a\\r\\nlittle to the side or sides of the womb, and the pain is made worse by\\r\\nmotion, exercise or long standing. If it is the acute variety, the\\r\\ntemperature rises, the pulse grows faster, and sometimes there is nausea\\r\\nand vomiting.\\r\\n\\r\\n[WOMAN\\'S DEPARTMENT 503]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Symptoms of the Chronic Variety are due to congestion and adhesions.\\r\\nThere is a constant pain in the region of the tube and the patient\\r\\nprotects herself when she walks, rides or sits down. There are difficult,\\r\\npainful monthly periods and too much flow. The history shows gonorrhea or\\r\\nseptic infection, that is, disease caused by the absorption of products of\\r\\nputrefaction.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment of the Acute Kind.--First thing is absolute rest and quiet in\\r\\nbed. Then prolonged hot injections in the vagina of hot water, and if you\\r\\nwish, one teaspoonful of listerine, etc., in each injection. Put a\\r\\nhot-water bag to the sore side, or fomentations of different remedies,\\r\\nlike hops, catnip, pennyroyal, smart-weed. The applications should not be\\r\\nof great weight. The bowels should be kept open.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor Chronic Variety.--This frequently calls for an operation. When the\\r\\nsymptoms are due to inflammation in the tube alone, ten per cent strength\\r\\nof ichthyol and glycerin tampons placed behind the lower part of the womb\\r\\nthree times a week do much to improve the condition.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is an unfortunate disease, and it must be closely watched for\\r\\nsymptoms that may arise from a pus condition. There are many cases of this\\r\\nkind in our public hospitals, and when they are due to gonorrhea they may\\r\\nhave been caused by the husband who had an acute or latent gonorrhea--an\\r\\nattack he thought cured.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDISEASES OF THE OVARY.\\r\\n\\r\\nInflammation of the Ovary or Ovaritis.--This is an inflammation of the\\r\\novary and it may be either acute or chronic.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the acute form the ovary is slightly enlarged and the follicles on the\\r\\ncircumference are distended and filled with thick fluid or pus.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the chronic variety the ovary may be small and contain cysts; there is\\r\\na destruction of the follicles and a hardened condition develops. The\\r\\nfunction of the ovary is then impaired.\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses.--Gonorrhea, septic infection from adjacent tissues, acute fever\\r\\ndiseases, mumps, and peritonitis. Falling (prolapse) often gives rise to\\r\\nchronic inflammation.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--Pain in the lower abdomen (pelvis), difficult and painful\\r\\nmenstruation, too much monthly flow (menorrhagia), and painful\\r\\nintercourse.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--Ichthyol (ten percent) and glycerin tampons placed behind the\\r\\nlower back part of the womb three times a week. The bowels should be kept\\r\\nopen with salts. The diet should be milk or liquid. Sometimes an operation\\r\\nis necessary. In the department on operations this subject will be touched\\r\\nupon in regard to operations.\\r\\n\\r\\nPHYSICIANS\\' TREATMENT.--Change of the mode of life, and proper hygienic\\r\\nmeasures will generally be all that is needed.\\r\\n\\r\\n[504 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nTUMORS OF THE OVARY.--Cystoma is the most common tumor of the ovary. The\\r\\nword \"cystoma\" means a cyst tumor, or cystic tumor. A cyst means a cavity\\r\\ncontaining fluid and surrounded by a covering (capsule). Ovarian cyst or\\r\\ntumors is often seen in print these days. Ovarian tumor takes in the\\r\\ncystic variety, cancer and sarcoma, two malignant tumors.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--These depend upon the size of the tumors. The large tumors are\\r\\ngenerally cystic. Examination of the vagina shows the pelvis filled by a\\r\\ntense, watery, fluctuating mass. Examining the abdomen, the abdomen is\\r\\nseen more or less distended by a regular swelling, and sometimes this is\\r\\nenormous. The abdomen is rounded and there is no bulging at the sides like\\r\\nthere is in ascites (dropsy). The navel is not prominent. The tumor can be\\r\\noutlined. It cannot be in ascites.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--In bygone years tapping was done for these tumors. If it gets\\r\\nlarge or the health fails, an operation should be performed. This is very\\r\\nsuccessful in uncomplicated cases. Inside of two months the patient is\\r\\nabout well. I know I have saved many lives of women by recommending an\\r\\noperation for such tumors.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the congested ovary, treatment by tampons and medicine often helps. I\\r\\nhave frequently given a medicine called Apis-Mel for this condition and\\r\\nwith success. I give it in tablets of 1/100 of a grain regularly four\\r\\ntimes a day.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMENSTRUATION AND ITS DISORDERS.--Normal menstruation occurs monthly in the\\r\\nfemale. There is a flow of blood from the cavity of the womb. The time for\\r\\nits beginning is different in different countries, it being earlier in\\r\\nwarm climates, ten to twelve years, and later in cold ones (fifteen to\\r\\nseventeen years); the average is fourteen years.\\r\\n\\r\\nPregnancy suspends menstruation and often nursing the child does, also.\\r\\nMenstruation continues longer in robust, healthy women. Change of life\\r\\n(Menopause) occurs usually between forty and fifty years. The healthy girl\\r\\nand woman comes around every twenty-eight to thirty days. This is the\\r\\nusual time. The flow lasts from two to eight days and the quantity is\\r\\nabout one ounce each day. A slight feeling of weight and fullness in the\\r\\nlower abdomen (pelvis) should be the only symptom present in a healthy\\r\\nfemale. The blood lost should not cause any special degree of weakness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPREMATURE MENSTRUATION. Too early menstruation.--Premature or precocious\\r\\nmenstruation is when it occurs before puberty. This is in part hereditary,\\r\\nbut bad associations may be a cause of this early menstruation.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--The cause, if possible, should be removed. The nerves should\\r\\nbe kept quiet by rest and, if needed, general tonics like iron, arsenic,\\r\\nand nux vomica prescribed and given.\\r\\n\\r\\n[WOMAN\\'S DEPARTMENT 505]\\r\\n\\r\\nDELAYED MENSTRUATION.--This is often caused by slow development of the\\r\\ngenerative organs. The girl may not come around until seventeenth to\\r\\nnineteenth year.\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses.--It may be due to heredity. Lack of proper nourishment and proper\\r\\nexercise are the most important causative factors.\\r\\n\\r\\nMOTHERS\\' REMEDIES.--l.

These increase in severity as\\r\\nthe retained blood distends the womb.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--If there is no opening for the vagina or cervix one must be\\r\\nmade, by operation. If it is due to anemia or chlorosis, Blaud\\'s pills\\r\\nwill benefit. The following is the formula:\\r\\n\\r\\n    Dried Sulphate of Iron      2 drams\\r\\n    Carbonate of Potash         2 drams\\r\\n    Syrup--Sufficient quantity to make forty-eight pills.\\r\\n\\r\\n    Take one to three pills three times a day, after meals.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMENORRHAGIA.--Too much bleeding at the monthly periods. If it occurs\\r\\nbetween the monthly periods it is called Metrorrhagia, womb-bleeding at\\r\\nany time, especially between the periods.\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses.--These may be constitutional or local, the latter being the most\\r\\nimportant.\\r\\n\\r\\nLocal Causes.--These are inflammation of the womb, displacements of the\\r\\nwomb, malignant disease of the womb, fibroid tumors and disease of the\\r\\novaries.\\r\\n\\r\\n[506 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--Sudden or gradual increase in the amount of blood lost at the\\r\\nmonthly periods.

In young girls and women who are not married, thirty drops of the fluid\\r\\nextract of Ergot three times a day. This medicine will cause the womb to\\r\\ncontract. Hot douches can be given to married women. If the bleeding is\\r\\nsevere it may be necessary to pack the vagina with sterile gauze. Ergotin\\r\\nten to twenty drops, may be needed, given hypodermically. If it is due to\\r\\nconstitutional causes, like anemia, a played-out feeling, paleness.\\r\\nweakness, etc., a tonic treatment is needed.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Blaud\\'s pills will do well. This is the formula:\\r\\n\\r\\n    Dried sulphate of iron       2 drams\\r\\n    Carbonate of potash          2 drams\\r\\n    Syrup                enough to make a mass\\r\\n\\r\\nMix and make forty-eight pills. Take one to three, three times a day after\\r\\nmeals.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. If the appetite is poor, bitter tonics such as gentian, quassia,\\r\\ncinchona, or nux vomica are needed.\\r\\n\\r\\n    Compound Tincture Cinchona      2 ounces\\r\\n    Compound Tincture Gentian       2 ounces\\r\\n\\r\\nMix. Take one teaspoonful before meals, in a little water.\\r\\n\\r\\n5. Tincture of nux vomica in doses of two to three drops after meals is a\\r\\ngood stomach and bowel tonic.\\r\\n\\r\\n6. Golden seal root made into a tea is good in some cases, especially if\\r\\nthe tongue is much coated.\\r\\n\\r\\n7. Oil of Erigeron or flea-bane is good for oozing bleeding. Dose: Three\\r\\nto five drops in a capsule every four hours.\\r\\n\\r\\n8. Oil of cinnamon in one dose of one-half dram is good where flea-bane\\r\\noil cannot be used or obtained; usual dose, one to five drops. An infusion\\r\\ncan be made of the cinnamon bark and drank freely.\\r\\n\\r\\n[WOMAN\\'S DEPARTMENT 507]\\r\\n\\r\\n9. Cranesbill (Geranium maculata). The fluid extract is splendid when\\r\\ndiluted three or four times with boiled water, used locally for bleeding\\r\\nfrom the womb, or as an injection for the same; or an infusion can be made\\r\\nof the plant and injected into the vagina. The local cause mentioned\\r\\nshould be treated. The displacement should be corrected.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDYSMENORRHEA or Difficult Menstruation.--This term means difficult and\\r\\npainful monthly periods. The pain may occur before, during or after the\\r\\nperiods.\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses.--It may be caused by a narrow cervical canal, the canal from the\\r\\ninner womb to the vagina. This is often very narrow and almost closed.\\r\\nAgain it is produced by the womb being turned back and bent on the canal,\\r\\nthus partially closing it. This causes the blood to be retained in the\\r\\nwomb and then the womb contracts to expel the blood, pains being the\\r\\nnatural result. Diseases of the womb and ovaries also cause it. Sometimes\\r\\nthe membrane of the womb is cast off in the form of shreds or even a cast\\r\\nof the inner womb.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--The flow may be scanty, moderate or profuse, often clotted. The\\r\\npain varies. It may be slight before the flow, or the first day or two, or\\r\\nit may be severe, agonizing and continuous for one or two days, or during\\r\\nthe whole period and sometimes for some days after there may be pains.\\r\\n\\r\\nMOTHERS\\' REMEDIES. 1. Painful Menstruation, a Good Tonic for.--\"This may\\r\\nbe relieved by sitting over the steam of a strong decoction of tansy,\\r\\nwormwood, and yarrow, and fomenting the abdomen with the same. Then take\\r\\nthe following in wineglassful doses:--One ounce each of ground pine,\\r\\nsouthern wood, tansy, catnip and germander, simmering in two quarts of\\r\\nwater down to three pints and pour boiling hot on one ounce of pennyroyal\\r\\nherb, strain when cold and take as per dose above.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Painful Menstruation, a Home Remedy for.--\"Let the patient take an\\r\\nactive cathartic; then when put to bed let a half cup of hop tea be given;\\r\\nand a douche of one quart of hot water into which ten drops of laudanum\\r\\nhave been dropped, be injected.\" A cathartic is not necessary in all\\r\\ncases. If the bowels have been moving freely do not take one. The douche\\r\\nwill give great relief providing the woman can take one while\\r\\nmenstruating. Some women can and some cannot.\\r\\n\\r\\n[508 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nPHYSICIANS\\' TREATMENT.--If the womb is displaced it should be corrected.\\r\\nAny disease of the womb or ovaries should be treated. If the canal is too\\r\\nmuch closed, gradual and careful dilation between the periods, will often\\r\\nremove this cause in time. The bowels should be kept regular at all times.\\r\\n\\r\\n1. For the attack.--Never take opium or alcohol for it in any form; it is\\r\\nso easy to form the habit and a doctor who gives it is simply dodging\\r\\neffective general and local treatment between the periods. If it is due to\\r\\ntaking cold, or from any local cause, the following  treatment is good:\\r\\nThe patient should take a hot sitz bath, being well covered by a blanket,\\r\\nwhile in the tub and afterwards, and should immediately get into bed as\\r\\nsoon as the buttocks are dried and remain there well covered. A turpentine\\r\\nstupe is now to be used, prepared as follows: Place a tin cup containing\\r\\nthe turpentine in a vessel containing hot water. This will keep the\\r\\nturpentine warm. Dip a piece of flannel into very hot water and wring it\\r\\nout in a twisted towel, and after it is perfectly dry and no dripping, dip\\r\\nit into the hot turpentine and wring it out again to free it from too much\\r\\nof the drug. Apply the cloth while hot and allow it to remain until it\\r\\ncauses discomfort. Then withdraw it or it will blister the skin if left on\\r\\ntoo long. Fomentations wrung out of teas like hop, pennyroyal, smart-weed,\\r\\netc., applied and kept warm often do much good. At the same time\\r\\npennyroyal tea can be drank freely. A five-cent package can be bought at\\r\\nany drug store. Hot lemonade will help also. The object is to produce\\r\\nrelaxation of the tissues through the local applications and tea drinking.\\r\\nIf there is constipation, the bowels should be moved freely with epsom\\r\\nsalts, half ounce dose, in the morning before breakfast. If there is much\\r\\npain a belladonna suppository, one-half grain of the extract, can be\\r\\ninserted into the rectum.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. If the patient\\'s nervous system is run down the \"Rest Cure\" will be of\\r\\nbenefit, and medicines to strengthen the nerves. Exercise, outdoor life,\\r\\nhorseback riding are of great benefit in toning the system.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Fluid extract of blue cohosh is a good medicine in this disease,\\r\\nespecially if there is some rheumatism during the interval. One or two\\r\\ndrops every hour will be enough.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Tincture of Pulsatilla in doses of three drops every hour is good for\\r\\nthe pain, especially in blonde girls and women.\\r\\n\\r\\n5. Tincture of Cocculus I have found to be of great benefit. Put five\\r\\ndrops of a good pure tincture into a glass half full of water and give two\\r\\nteaspoonfuls every ten to fifteen minutes until relieved. This I give in\\r\\ncases I am called to and have not the time then to find out what the real\\r\\ncause may be.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDISPLACEMENTS.--Turning back or retro-displacements. This includes retro-\\r\\nversion and retro-flexion. Retro-version means turning back, in plain\\r\\nterms. Retro-flexion means bending back, bending of the body of the womb,\\r\\nor the neck, backward. Retro-flexion is more common than retro-version.\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses.--Some are congenital, that is, from birth, and a few are the\\r\\nresult of some injury, falls or blows. It is more often found in\\r\\nchild-bearing women, and this may be due to the fact that the womb has not\\r\\nreturned to its normal size and weight, and therefore there is more weight\\r\\nfor the ligaments to hold up. The ligaments often relax and do not support\\r\\nthe womb as thoroughly as before.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--Backache, a sense of weight in the lower abdomen, difficult\\r\\nmenstruation, leucorrhea, sterility, or repeated abortion and\\r\\nconstipation. The constipation is often due to the womb lying on the\\r\\nrectum.\\r\\n\\r\\n[WOMAN\\'S DEPARTMENT 509]\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--This is to replace the womb and keep it in position. Supports\\r\\nof various kinds are used to keep the womb in position after it has been\\r\\nreplaced, They must fit thoroughly and give no pain or any discomfort\\r\\nwhatever. They are called supports or pessaries. If they are fitted\\r\\nproperly they do much good. They should be removed often (every month) and\\r\\nnot allowed to grow fast or cause sores in the vagina. There are the ring\\r\\nsupport and the stem variety and others. The stem variety can be taken out\\r\\nand replaced by wearer at any time. They are made to buckle around the\\r\\nabdomen. They are bungling but effective. The ring kind should be\\r\\nintroduced by a competent person who should see that it is of correct size\\r\\nand shape, and worn with comfort. Sometimes these supports fail to cure\\r\\nwhen adhesions and other diseases exist; it may be impossible to wear\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n\\r\\nOperations.--One operation is to break up the adhesions, the body of the\\r\\nwomb brought forward and sewn (sutured) to the abdominal wall. Another\\r\\noperation is to shorten the round ligaments in the inguinal (groin) canal.\\r\\nThese are the usual operations, and they are quite successful.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFALLING OR PROLAPSE OF THE WOMB.--The womb may come down and remain in the\\r\\nvagina (incomplete falling). When the womb escapes at the vulva it is\\r\\ncalled a complete falling (prolapse or procidentia).\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the Incomplete Kind.--Replace the womb and wear a support for months.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the Complete Falling.--Replace the womb. The patient should remain in\\r\\nbed with daily, hot, prolonged vaginal injections of water for a few\\r\\nweeks. The injection daily of white oak bark tea, of the strength of one\\r\\nounce of the bark to a pint of hot water, is often of great benefit.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf these measures fail to cure, an operation may be necessary.\\r\\n\\r\\nMOTHERS\\' REMEDIES. 1. Falling of the Womb. Unicorn Root for.--\"Make a\\r\\nstrong tea of unicorn root, and take a half teaspoonful three times a day,\\r\\nThis is an excellent remedy for falling of the womb,\" This is very easily\\r\\nprepared and not bad to take, and in addition to this use an injection of\\r\\nwitch-hazel or golden seal.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Falling of the Womb, a Fine Herb Combination for.--\"Peach leaves,\\r\\nmullein leaves and hops made into a tea, and a pint used twice a day as an\\r\\ninjection often cures when other remedies fail.\" We all know that this\\r\\ncombination of herbs is healing and especially in female trouble. The\\r\\nhops, especially, are very soothing to the affected parts.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Falling of the Womb, a Physician\\'s. Treatment.--\"Knee-chest position.\\r\\nGet down on the knees and put chest and chin to the floor.

It is not a disease, but a symptom of some\\r\\nvaginal or uterine disorder; hence, general or specific tonics may be\\r\\nneeded but appropriate injection as auxiliary treatment will very much\\r\\nassist in cure. The patient should bathe frequently and freely expose\\r\\nherself to the sunshine, and have good ventilation in the house. If the\\r\\nvaginal passage is very tender and irritable, an infusion, or tea, of\\r\\nslippery elm bark is very soothing and may be used freely with a vaginal\\r\\nsyringe.

The active menstrual life lasts on an average\\r\\nfor thirty years and ends between forty and fifty years of age. The courts\\r\\nhave recognized the age of fifty-three years as the limit that a woman can\\r\\nbecome pregnant.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe onset of the change of life, may be sudden or gradual. The organs\\r\\nshrink and waste. The womb shrinks and part of its muscular tissue\\r\\ndisappears and its walls become thin, soft and relaxed. The ovaries become\\r\\nsmall and harder. The vagina shortens and also becomes narrower. Sudden\\r\\nmental shock, wasting disease or change of climate, may cause a sudden\\r\\nappearance of the change of life.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--Many women hardly notice any change, as it comes on gradually.\\r\\nOther women have all kinds of bodily and mental symptoms, and some are\\r\\nafraid of becoming insane. The heart palpitates readily, feelings of heat\\r\\nand cold, flushes of heat of the face, followed by sudden sweating.

Change of Life. Good Advice From an Experienced Mother.--\"The first and\\r\\nmost important point to consider is the general health of the patient. If\\r\\nthe general health can be sustained there will be no danger attending this\\r\\ncritical period of life. Therefore whatever form of disease may manifest\\r\\nitself the one object should be to seek a remedy in time. Take special\\r\\npains to preserve general good health and take care not to overwork, take\\r\\nplenty of outdoor exercise and keep up a regular action of the bowels.\\r\\nPurify the blood with tonics if necessary.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPHYSICIANS\\' TREATMENT.--Exercise, fresh air, with freedom from worry,\\r\\nanxiety and care. Many women at this time of life need much encouragement,\\r\\nand cheerful company is a good tonic. Prominent annoying symptoms should\\r\\nbe met with the proper medicine. Irregular bleeding of the womb at this\\r\\ntime or after should lead to an examination as to its origin.\\r\\n\\r\\n[514 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCYSTOCELE--Cystocele is simply a tumor formed by the bladder pressing into\\r\\nthe walls of the vagina. The bladder descends into the pelvis on account\\r\\nof relaxation or destruction of its normal support. The anterior wall of\\r\\nthe vagina yields.\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses.--Tear of the perineum allows the bottom of the pelvis to relax.\\r\\nUndue relaxation of the ligaments of the bladder and of the floor of the\\r\\npelvis, with over distention of the bladder, are responsible for the\\r\\nmajority of the cases.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--Weight and dragging feeling. A tumor can be felt in the vagina.\\r\\nIt decreases when the bladder is emptied.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--Supports are suitable in some cases (Skene\\'s pessary). An\\r\\noperation is necessary in many cases.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRECTOCELE.--The muscle that holds up the lower end of the rectum is\\r\\nrelaxed or torn and this deprives the lower end of the rectum of its\\r\\nsupport so that during expulsion of the feces forward distention of the\\r\\nanterior wall of the rectum into the vagina results. The posterior wall of\\r\\nthe vagina is carried before the advancing anterior rectal wall, and\\r\\nappears at the entrance of the vagina as a bulging tumor which is\\r\\nincreased in size with every effort of the rectum to cast out the feces.\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses.--Hard child-birth (labor) and the long time the head of the child\\r\\nwas resting on the perineum. This resulted in an overstretching or tear of\\r\\nthe muscle that holds up the lower end of the bowel and the parts were\\r\\nnecessarily weakened.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--It is hard to entirely empty the rectum because of the presence\\r\\nof the tumor. This is soft, rounded, increasing and decreasing in size and\\r\\ndisappears upon pressure.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--Keep, if possible, the tumor from getting larger, regulate the\\r\\nbowels.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn operation may be necessary to restore the parts to their normal\\r\\ncondition. A physician must be consulted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[OBSTETRICS OR MIDWIFERY 515]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOBSTETRICS OR MIDWIFERY\\r\\n\\r\\nSmall bodies are contained in the ovaries. These are called eggs or ova.\\r\\nThe human egg is about 1/125 of an inch in diameter. This egg enlarges and\\r\\none or more escape from the ovaries, usually about the time of the monthly\\r\\nsickness, and are caught by the ends of the Fallopian tube, enter its\\r\\ncanal and are carried into the womb. After they have arrived in the womb\\r\\nthey are, as a rule, cast off with the secretion and leave the body. If in\\r\\nthe course of its travel from the ovaries, through the tube to the womb,\\r\\nthe female ovum or egg meets with the male elements, fertilization or\\r\\nimpregnation may take place. If then it is not cast off it generally\\r\\nlodges in the womb and pregnancy has begun. The male and female elements\\r\\nare usually supposed to meet in the outer portion of the Fallopian tubes,\\r\\nfertilization then taking place; but this can occur any place from the\\r\\novary to the womb. When the fertilized egg enters the womb it is usually\\r\\narrested in the folds of the womb membrane nearest the opening of the tube\\r\\nand at once attaches itself to the womb wall. The folds by which it is\\r\\nsurrounded then grow forward and their edges unite over the egg or ovum\\r\\nforming a sac--the decidua reflexa. Then follows the development of this\\r\\novum and with it the development of the womb, and this growth or\\r\\ndevelopment constitutes the process which is called pregnancy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Embryo or impregnated egg is nourished in the womb by measures\\r\\npreparing for it. The placenta or after-birth forms during the third month\\r\\nof pregnancy. Its function is to furnish nourishment breathing\\r\\n(respiration) and excreting power to the embryo or impregnated egg. The\\r\\nfully developed after-birth is a roundish spongy mass with a diameter of\\r\\nabout eight inches and weighs about one pound. It is usually thickest at\\r\\nthe center, the edges thinning out to the membranes. The inner surface is\\r\\nsmooth and glistening and is covered by a membrane (amnion) and beneath\\r\\nthis two arteries and a vein branch in all directions.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cord is attached to the inner surface of the after-birth and is of a\\r\\nglistening white color, varying in thickness, and is about twenty-two\\r\\ninches long, but it may be longer or shorter. It contains two arteries and\\r\\na vein, which run in a somewhat spinal course.\\r\\n\\r\\nDEVELOPMENT AT DIFFERENT MONTHS.--\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst month.--There are indications of the eyes, mouth and anus. The\\r\\nextremities are rudimentary. The heart is 4/10 of an inch long.\\r\\n\\r\\nSecond month.--It is now about one inch long. The eyes, nose and ears can\\r\\nbe distinguished. External genitals. There are suggestions of the hands\\r\\nand feet.\\r\\n\\r\\n[516 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nThird month.--The ovum is now the size of a goose-egg. Fingers and toes\\r\\nseparate, nails look like fine membranes. The neck separates the head from\\r\\nthe body. The sex can now be told. Length is five inches. Weight about 460\\r\\ngrains.\\r\\n\\r\\nFourth month.--Six inches long and now weighs 850 grains. Short hairs are\\r\\npresent. Head equal to about one-fourth entire body. May perceive\\r\\nquickening.\\r\\n\\r\\nFifth month.--Ten inches long; weighs eight ounces. Eyelids begin to\\r\\nseparate. Heart sounds can be heard. Quickening takes place.\\r\\n\\r\\nSixth month.--Twelve inches long; weighs 23-1/2 ounces. There is hair on\\r\\nthe head, eyebrows and eyelashes are present. Testicles show near the\\r\\nabdominal rings (openings).\\r\\n\\r\\nSeventh month.--Fifteen inches long; weight 41-1/2 ounces. Pupillary\\r\\nmembrane disappears.\\r\\n\\r\\nEighth month.--Sixteen inches long; weight 3-1/2 pounds. Left testicle has\\r\\ndescended into the scrotum. Nails protrude to end of finger tips.\\r\\n\\r\\nNinth month.--Eighteen inches long; weighs 4-1/2 to 7 pounds. Features are\\r\\ncomplete.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile this growth goes on in the embryo the womb itself shows changes. The\\r\\nvirgin womb averages 2-3/4 inches in length, 1-3/4 inches in width and 1\\r\\ninch in thickness and weighs about 12 drams. At term (confinement) the\\r\\nwomb is about 14 inches long, 10 inches wide, and 9-1/2 inches thick. This\\r\\nincrease in size is necessary for its growing contents and is due to both\\r\\nan enlargement of its tissues (hypertrophy) and to an increase in the\\r\\nnumber of its cells (hyperplasia). The muscular fibres are elongated to\\r\\nabout 11 inches, and they are five times thicker than they are in a womb\\r\\nthat is not pregnant. The cervix or neck of the womb participates but\\r\\nlittle in these changes, and remains practically the same until a few\\r\\nweeks before confinement. It becomes softened as the result of congestion,\\r\\nand the glands are more active, secreting a thick glairy mucus. The canal\\r\\nalso is more or less dilated.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile this process is going on in the womb, various other conditions show\\r\\nthemselves, sometimes in the parts of the body so distant that it may not\\r\\nbe easy to discover the connection with the womb. Almost any part of the\\r\\nbody is liable to show changes from its normal condition; and yet some of\\r\\nthese changes are so constant and regular as to be regarded as signs of\\r\\npregnancy. It must not be forgotten, however, that sure signs of\\r\\npregnancy, such as cannot be induced by other causes, are very limited,\\r\\nespecially in the early months.\\r\\n\\r\\n[OBSTETRICS OR MIDWIFERY 517]\\r\\n\\r\\nChanges occur in the genital organs that may lead a physician to suspect\\r\\nthat pregnancy may exist; but the first symptom that attracts the\\r\\nattention of the woman, is the passing of the monthly period. This is not\\r\\nan absolute sign of pregnancy, since other things or conditions may cause\\r\\nit. The effect of the mind upon the body may cause it, and it also occurs\\r\\nsometimes in early married life without any appreciable cause, unless it\\r\\nmay be then due to the effect upon the nervous system of the marital\\r\\nrelation. Again, the monthly sickness sometimes continues in a greater or\\r\\nless degree, during a part or even the whole of pregnancy. Usually this\\r\\ndischarge is due to some diseased condition of the cervix. The fear of\\r\\nimpregnation in unmarried women after illicit intercourse will\\r\\noccasionally suspend menstruation for one or two months.\\r\\n\\r\\nNausea and Vomiting.--Another symptom upon which considerable dependence\\r\\nis placed is the morning sickness (nausea and vomiting). While this\\r\\nsymptom is common, yet its absence does not prove that the woman is not\\r\\npregnant. Some women go through the whole pregnancy without any sign of\\r\\nthis symptom.\\r\\n\\r\\nNausea accompanied or not by vomiting may appear at the very time of\\r\\nconception, but it usually appears about the fourth or fifth week of\\r\\npregnancy and continues until the sixteenth week or longer. In some cases\\r\\nit may last but a short time, in others it may continue until confinement.\\r\\nIt may be light or severe; It generally manifests itself upon arising in\\r\\nthe morning and subsides in a short time, but it may occur at any time of\\r\\nthe day and continue during the entire waking hours. It may be absent\\r\\nentirely and, in rare instances, manifest itself in the husband alone. I\\r\\nhave known of one such case. This nausea may be excited only by various\\r\\nodors or sights or may be caused by constipation. An increased secretion\\r\\nfrom the salivary glands usually accompanies the stomach disturbances and\\r\\nin some cases it may amount to salivation. An irresistible desire for\\r\\ncertain articles of food or drink, generally of a sour or acid nature, is\\r\\noften developed. Indigestion, gas in the bowels and belching of gas are\\r\\nfrequently present. The appetite is often capricious or it may be entirely\\r\\nlost (anorexia).\\r\\n\\r\\nBreasts.--Changes in the breasts also constitute a sign of pregnancy. As\\r\\nan early symptom, there may be a feeling of fullness, sometimes pain. They\\r\\nbecome larger and firmer from the development of the individual lobules,\\r\\nwhich have an irregular knotty feel. A fat deposit takes place between the\\r\\nlobules and in the other parts of the breast. The nipples increase in\\r\\nsize, are harder to the touch, become more prominent. A few drops of a\\r\\nturbid fluid, colostrum, may be pressed from the nipple as early as the\\r\\nthird month. The veins under the skin become larger and more conspicuous.\\r\\nThe rose-colored circles (rings) around the nipples are broadened and are\\r\\nslightly elevated above the surrounding skin and there is a marked\\r\\nincrease in their pigmentation, the color varying with the complexion of\\r\\nthe individual from reddish pink to brown and black. These changes usually\\r\\noccur at the beginning of the third month, and if  the woman has already\\r\\nhad a child the question of pregnancy has been decided by inspection of\\r\\nthese breast changes.\\r\\n\\r\\nBladder.--This is sometimes irritable in the later months, causing a\\r\\nfrequent desire to pass urine. It sometimes occurs in the second or third\\r\\nweek and is sometimes followed, later, by an inability to retain the urine\\r\\nwhich escapes at any time. This, however, is not frequent.\\r\\n\\r\\n[518 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nAbdominal changes.--There is a slight flattening of the lower abdomen at\\r\\nthe second month, due to the sinking of the womb. There is also a slight\\r\\nretraction (drawing back) of the navel. After the third month, when the\\r\\nwomb begins to ascend out of the pelvis, a progressive enlargement of the\\r\\nabdomen begins and continues until near the end of pregnancy, when the\\r\\nwomb again sinks and the so-called lightening occurs. The protrusion of\\r\\nthe abdomen is more marked usually on the right side. There is often an\\r\\nincreased deposit of fat in the lower portion of the abdomen, as well as\\r\\non the hips and thighs. The navel may protrude after the sixth month,\\r\\n\\r\\nPigmentation.--Pigmentation or darkening of the middle line of the abdomen\\r\\nbegins by the eighth or twelfth week, and a dark band about 1/8 of an inch\\r\\nwide extends from the pubis (bone) to and around the navel or even higher.\\r\\nThis shows plainer in brunettes, where it is quite conspicuous.\\r\\nDiscolorations also appear on other parts of the body, especially on the\\r\\nface, \"moth patches.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nQuickening.--This is caused by the movement of the child (foetus) in the\\r\\nwomb. The impact of the enlarging womb, through the child (foetal)\\r\\nmovements, against the abdominal wall about the sixteenth week of\\r\\npregnancy gives rise to this sensation called quickening. Some women claim\\r\\nto have experienced this sensation at a much earlier date, and by some it\\r\\nis not felt at all. Gas in the bowels and contraction of the muscles of\\r\\nthe abdomen may give a chance for mistakes. In the later months of\\r\\npregnancy, the movements sometimes become so violent as to produce\\r\\nperceptible movements of the womb and the abdominal muscles, and sometimes\\r\\nthey are the cause of the pain.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Blood.--The blood is increased in quantity and slightly altered in its\\r\\ncomposition. The water, fibrin and white corpuscles are increased; the red\\r\\ncells are at first relatively diminished, but later return to normal.\\r\\n\\r\\nNervous System.--The nervous system is over sensitive and the disposition\\r\\nof the woman may undergo a radical change, mental exaltation and\\r\\ndepression are often exhibited.\\r\\n\\r\\nConstipation is the Rule.--Neuralgias in different parts of the body,\\r\\nespecially in the face and teeth, are common. Palpitation of the heart and\\r\\ndifficulty in breathing may be experienced. A discharge from the vagina is\\r\\nalmost always present, due to the increased circulation in the cervix and\\r\\nvagina.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foetal Heart-beat.--This is the one positive sign of pregnancy and it\\r\\nmay be heard as early as the sixteenth to the twentieth week. It has been\\r\\ncompared to the ticking of a watch under a pillow. It ranges in frequency\\r\\nfrom one hundred and ten to one hundred and fifty to a minute.\\r\\n\\r\\n[OBSTETRICS OR MIDWIFERY 519]\\r\\n\\r\\nPelvic Signs.--As early as the first month of pregnancy a faint violet\\r\\ncolor of the anterior wall of the vagina just below the opening of the\\r\\nurethra may be distinguished. In the third month this color has become\\r\\npurplish and pronounced. This sign is present in eighty per cent of cases.\\r\\nThere is also a more or less marked lividity of the vaginal portion of the\\r\\ncervix from the first month of pregnancy. Also there is softening of the\\r\\ncervix as early as the sixth week, and as pregnancy advances the whole of\\r\\nthe cervix is softened.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuration of Pregnancy.--This is for all practical purposes two hundred and\\r\\neighty days.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow to Determine Date of Confinement.--The best rule is to count backward\\r\\nthree months from the first day of the last menstrual period and add seven\\r\\ndays to it. To be more accurate, in April and September only six days\\r\\nshould be added; in December and January, five days; and in February, four\\r\\ndays.\\r\\n\\r\\nPosition of the Womb.--At four months the top of the womb has risen above\\r\\nthe pelvic brim bone in front; at five months, it is midway between the\\r\\nbone (pubic) and the navel; at six months, it is at the navel; at seven\\r\\nmonths, it is four fingers breadths above the navel; at eight months, it\\r\\nis midway between the navel and the bottom of the breast bone; at nine\\r\\nmonths, it is to the breast bone; from the middle to the end of the ninth\\r\\nmonth, the top of the womb sinks to about the position occupied at the\\r\\neighth month.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwins occur about once in ninety to one hundred and twenty, triplets once\\r\\nin one thousand eight hundred and seventy-five, and quadruplets once in\\r\\nthree hundred and seventy-one thousand one hundred and twenty-six\\r\\npregnancies. The causes are unknown. Twin conception is more common in\\r\\nwomen who have borne children, and more so in the elderly than in the\\r\\nyoung, first bearing women (primiparae).\\r\\n\\r\\nSex.--Children from the same ovum (egg) are always of the same sex. Of\\r\\ntwins in general, more than one-third are males, less than one-third are\\r\\nfemales, and in the remaining one-third both sexes occur. The after-birth\\r\\nis always, at least at first, double.\\r\\n\\r\\nDiagnosis.--In twin pregnancy the symptoms and disorders of pregnancy are\\r\\napt to be exaggerated, and watery swelling above the pubic bone is almost\\r\\nalways present in the latter months. The abdomen is larger and broader and\\r\\nthere may be a depression dividing the abdominal wall in two spaces. The\\r\\nwomb is much distended and the walls are thin.\\r\\n\\r\\nHygiene of pregnancy.--In pregnancy the dividing line between health and\\r\\ndisease is often so shadowy that every care should be given the pregnant\\r\\nwoman, not only that she shall escape dangers that may come, but that the\\r\\nfuture health of the coming baby may be safeguarded.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe care taken in pregnancy therefore should include attention to\\r\\nclothing, food, exercise, rest, sleep, functions of all excreting organs,\\r\\nthe breasts, nervous system and the mind.\\r\\n\\r\\n[520 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nClothing.--This should be worn loose. The heavier garments should not be\\r\\nheld by the waist but suspended from the shoulders. Flannels, if possible,\\r\\nshould be worn next the skin excepting, possibly, during the warmest\\r\\nweather. Every precaution should be taken not to take cold or to chill the\\r\\nsurface of the body, as this might bring on an acute trouble of the\\r\\nkidneys. As soon as the womb has risen out of the pelvis during the fourth\\r\\nmonth, the corset should be absolutely abandoned, since pressure upon the\\r\\nenlarging womb tends to cause acute Bright\\'s disease and uraemia, and\\r\\nthese troubles are always to be guarded against. During the later months\\r\\nof pregnancy, when the abdominal enlargement is great, a linen or elastic\\r\\nbandage may be worn with great comfort, but it must be so put on as to\\r\\nsupport and not press upon the womb.\\r\\n\\r\\nFood.--The food of the pregnant woman should be simple, wholesome,\\r\\nnutritious, of the kind that is easily digested and enough to satisfy the\\r\\ndemands of her system; excessive eating should be avoided. A mixed diet is\\r\\nto be preferred, but the diet should be of such kind as to help to\\r\\novercome the constipation, usual in pregnancy. Meat should not be eaten in\\r\\nas great quantities. It not only tends to produce more constipation but\\r\\nalso has injurious effect upon the kidneys, and anything that in any way\\r\\nputs a greater burden upon the kidneys in pregnancy should be avoided. All\\r\\nfoods that are likely to produce indigestion, heart burn, or irritation of\\r\\nthe stomach and liver, such as sweets, fried, greasy, highly spiced foods;\\r\\ngreasy rich gravies, or pastry should not be eaten.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe heartiest meal should be taken near midday and the stomach, especially\\r\\nat night, should never be overloaded. Water should, be drank freely, as it\\r\\ntends to overcome the constipation and wash out the kidneys. Some women do\\r\\nbetter with lighter meals and taken more frequently. Some do better by\\r\\ntaking their breakfast before rising.\\r\\n\\r\\nBathing.--Extremes in hot and cold bathing should be avoided. The skin\\r\\nshould be kept active by daily comfortable baths, followed by a brisk\\r\\nrubbing with a rough towel. The Bowels and Bladder.--The bowels, as before\\r\\nstated, are usually constipated and should be kept open by coarse foods,\\r\\nfruit and, when necessary, mild laxatives; mineral waters and enemas\\r\\nespecially should not be given. It should not be forgotten that in some\\r\\nwomen injections into the bowel are liable to bring on contractions of the\\r\\nwomb.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo woman, and especially no pregnant woman, should ever neglect the\\r\\nbowels, as much discomfort and ill health are caused by improper\\r\\neliminations of the bowel contents. The bladder should also have proper\\r\\ncare. This is apt to be irritable during the early and later months of\\r\\npregnancy, owing to being pressed upon by the womb. A mild inflammation\\r\\narises in some cases. The woman should take plenty of water, either pure\\r\\nor effervescing, to induce sufficient secretion  in the kidneys, and also\\r\\nto flush them. This is also very good for an irritable bladder. In order\\r\\nthat the physician may keep himself informed regarding the condition of\\r\\nthe kidneys, the urine of every pregnant woman should be examined, both\\r\\nchemically and microscopically, every two weeks from the beginning of\\r\\npregnancy; during the late months of pregnancy the urine analysis should\\r\\nbe made weekly. Catherized specimens should be used because leucorrheal\\r\\ndischarges, so common in pregnancy, may give the albumin reaction. If the\\r\\nabove advice of Dr. Manton, of Detroit, was followed in every case there\\r\\nwould be fewer cases of trouble during the confinement. I remember one\\r\\ncase; the lady was seven months along when I was called. She was feeling\\r\\nbadly and complained much of her eyes; an analysis of the urine showed\\r\\nthick with albumin. The failure of her sight was due to thc condition of\\r\\nher kidneys. If the urine had been examined early and often, her condition\\r\\nmight have been prevented. Watch the kidneys, have the urine examined\\r\\nfrequently and carefully.\\r\\n\\r\\n[OBSTETRICS OR MIDWIFERY 521]\\r\\n\\r\\nExercise, Rest and Sleep.--Plenty of exercise in the open air should be\\r\\ntaken daily, without this health cannot be maintained. It should not be\\r\\nviolent or so great as to fatigue and overtire. Slow riding in a carriage\\r\\nand walking will give the best results. Horseback riding and riding in an\\r\\nautomobile should be avoided. The woman should sit out of doors as much as\\r\\npossible. Plenty of sleep is also necessary. Eight hours are not too much\\r\\nat night, and lying down an hour or two during the forenoon and afternoon\\r\\nis very restful and desirable.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Vagina.--When there is a profuse discharge of leucorrhea, a daily\\r\\nvaginal douche is necessary. This should consist of a quart of warm\\r\\nsolution (as much as the water will dissolve) of boric acid, or an equal\\r\\namount of mild carbolic acid (one to eighty). The temperature of the\\r\\nsolution should be about 100 degrees F., and it should be injected slowly,\\r\\nand without any force to the stream.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is also best to remain in the recumbent position for some time after\\r\\nthe injection, to rest.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Breast and Nipples.--These should be bathed once or twice daily in\\r\\ncool or tepid water until the last month or two of pregnancy. Astringent\\r\\napplication should not be applied to the nipples to harden them. If the\\r\\nnipples are small, undeveloped or retracted they should be pulled out\\r\\nseveral times daily by the fingers and gently rubbed, and this will\\r\\nusually stimulate their growth. Cocoa butter or castor oil may be applied\\r\\nduring the last month.\\r\\n\\r\\nNervous System and the Mind.--The pregnant woman is very susceptible to\\r\\nannoying conditions of the social and domestic surroundings; such should\\r\\nbe removed, if possible, and excitement of every kind should be avoided.\\r\\nEverything should be made bright and comfortable around her, cheerfulness\\r\\nshould be the rule in the home and she should be treated with every care\\r\\nand consideration. Surroundings will influence the coming baby\\'s future.\\r\\n\\r\\n[522 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nDisorders of Pregnancy.--Nausea and vomiting.--The simple nausea and\\r\\nvomiting of pregnancy needs no treatment. This kind generally disappears\\r\\nby the third or fourth month, but it may persist in a mild form during the\\r\\ngreater part of pregnancy. Generally the regulation of the diet and\\r\\nattention to the bowels are all that is necessary to be done for this\\r\\ntrouble. Foods should be chosen carefully and only such foods taken that\\r\\nagree with the stomach and lessen the constipation. Sometimes taking a\\r\\nlight breakfast in bed saves the usual morning sickness. It is best then\\r\\nto remain lying for some time after eating. When the condition is annoying\\r\\nthe following powder will give much relief: powder Ingluvin, oxalate of\\r\\ncerium, of each five grains. Mix thoroughly and take one, every one or two\\r\\nhours as needed. A physician should be consulted if this trouble is very\\r\\nsevere.\\r\\n\\r\\nMOTHERS\\' REMEDIES.--1. Pregnancy, A Great Aid for.--\"Soothing syrup or\\r\\nMother\\'s friend, while pregnant. Two ounces each of cramp bark, blue\\r\\ncohosh, slippery elm, raspberry leaves, squaw vine, orange peel and bitter\\r\\nroot. Simmer gently in sufficient water to keep herbs covered for two\\r\\nhours, strain and steep gently down to one quart. Let it stand to cool,\\r\\nthen add one cup granulated sugar, and four ounces alcohol. Dose.--One\\r\\ntablespoonful two or three times a day for several weeks before the birth\\r\\nof the child. This has been thoroughly tried and causes an easy birth\\r\\nwhere difficulty has been expected.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Nausea of Pregnancy, Menthol and Sweet Oil for.--\"Vomiting and nausea\\r\\nof pregnancy; a twenty per cent solution of menthol in sweet oil; use ten\\r\\ndrops on sugar when nausea appears.\" The menthol acts on the stomach and\\r\\nquiets it. This will be found very beneficial.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Pregnancy, Bouillon or Broth for.--\"Was weak and generally run down.\\r\\nFamily physician warned me I would never survive the birth of another\\r\\nchild. I bought each day several beef bones and boiled them for three\\r\\nhours. I also bought chicken feet, scalded them and scraped them until the\\r\\noutside skin peeled off, then boiled the chicken feet with the bones. Skim\\r\\nsurface from time to time. I would then heat up a raw egg in a glass and\\r\\nfill glass with this broth and drink it warm.\" This lady would take a\\r\\nglass whenever thirsty or six or seven times a day. She increased in\\r\\nstrength immediately, within a year was the mother of a healthy baby girl\\r\\nnow nineteen years old and believes her life was saved by the above.\\r\\nAnyone will find this worth trying.\\r\\n\\r\\n[OBSTETRICS OR MIDWIFERY 523]\\r\\n\\r\\nIndigestion and Heart-burn.--This should be treated the same as under\\r\\nother conditions. Diet, habits, should be regulated. The bowels and\\r\\nkidneys should be regulated and do their eliminating work. For heart-burn\\r\\nthe popular remedy, magnesia may be taken or dilute hydrochloric acid with\\r\\nnux vomica. One teaspoonful or effervescing citrate of magnesia dissolved\\r\\nin water and drank, is a convenient remedy. Also, five drops of diluted\\r\\nhydrochloric acid in water, taken after meals, through a tube, and one or\\r\\ntwo drops of nux vomica before meals is beneficial. The following is an\\r\\nexcellent combination from Dr. Hare, of Philadelphia:\\r\\n\\r\\n    Dilute Hydrochloric Acid                      2 drams\\r\\n    Essence of Pepsin                             1 ounce\\r\\n    Compound Tincture of Gentian enough to make   4 ounces\\r\\n\\r\\nMix. Take one or two teaspoonfuls in a little water with meals.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn cases where it is impossible to eat anything the patient must be fed by\\r\\nthe rectum. In such cases a doctor must be called. Fortunately such severe\\r\\ncases are very rare. The following for rectal feeding is given by Dr.\\r\\nManton, of Detroit, and is a good combination. Give every four hours:\\r\\n\\r\\n    Liquid Beef Peptonoids                  3 drams\\r\\n    White of an Egg\\r\\n    Whisky                                  3 drams\\r\\n    Beef Tea or Warm Water enough to make   3 ounces\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rectum should be washed out once or twice daily in the interval\\r\\nbetween the feeding.\\r\\n\\r\\nTeeth.--The teeth are often affected during pregnancy, softening and\\r\\ndecaying rapidly, causing severe neuralgia. The teeth should be cleaned\\r\\nfrequently during the day to get rid of the secretions of the mouth, and\\r\\nat night before retiring. Milk of magnesia should be held in the mouth for\\r\\na few minutes; cavities in the teeth should be stopped with a temporary\\r\\nfilling. Teaspoonful of lacto phosphate of lime can be taken three times a\\r\\nday with benefit.\\r\\n\\r\\nConstipation.--The enlarging womb pressing upon the rectum and also\\r\\nirregularity in diet causes constipation at this time. Daily free bowel\\r\\nmovements are necessary to prevent the kidneys from overworking. As stated\\r\\nbefore, the diet should be strictly regulated. Cascara sagrada cordial is\\r\\na good mild laxative to take, if necessary.\\r\\n\\r\\nDifficult Breathing.--This usually comes late in pregnancy and is due to\\r\\nthe pressure of the womb upon the diaphragm; the patient should avoid\\r\\nexcitement and sleep with the shoulders well elevated. In the ninth month\\r\\nthe womb drops lower and the breathing is better.\\r\\n\\r\\nVaricose Veins and Piles.--Varicose veins: These are due to the pressure\\r\\non the veins so that the return flow of blood is impeded and occur as a\\r\\nrule late in pregnancy. They are seen oftenest on the inner side of the\\r\\nthighs, the lower extremities, the vulva, and in the region of the anus.\\r\\nAs a rule, they do not give much trouble. When they become painful or\\r\\ninflamed the patient should lie down, with the legs elevated and use water\\r\\nof witch-hazel applied with cloths. Elastic stockings, properly fitted,\\r\\ngive much relief when the trouble is on the thigh and leg.\\r\\n\\r\\n[524 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nPiles.--When these are troublesome the rectum should be emptied by a small\\r\\ndose of salts, and the parts thoroughly washed with warm water, the piles\\r\\npushed back and local lotions applied (see treatment of piles). Hot\\r\\nfomentations of witch-hazel frequently give great relief to the piles as\\r\\nwell as to the varicose veins. Regular movements of the bowels usually\\r\\nwill prevent piles. Piles will not usually give rise to much trouble\\r\\nunless constipation exists.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlbumin in the urine. (Albuminuria).--While the urine of about six to ten\\r\\nper cent of all pregnant women contains albumin, the appearance of this\\r\\nsymptom should always be regarded with apprehension. Women who are in\\r\\ntheir first pregnancy are most frequently affected. If the woman has had\\r\\ndisease of the kidneys before her pregnancy began this symptom will likely\\r\\nappear in the early months; if it is caused by pressure, etc., it may not\\r\\nappear until after the sixth month, but both acute and chronic.\\r\\ninflammation of the kidneys may develop at any period of pregnancy. Dr.\\r\\nManton, of Detroit, states, \"In the majority of cases, the albuminuria is\\r\\ndue to the so-called kidney of pregnancy, in which there is no\\r\\ninflammation, but a fatty infiltration of the epithelial cells associated\\r\\nwith anemia of the organ.\" The urine may also contain casts. Whatever the\\r\\ncause it indicates a condition of insufficiency of the kidney which may\\r\\nlead to serious consequences to the mother and it is also injurious to the\\r\\n(foetus) child. If this symptom develops suddenly the danger to both is\\r\\ngreatly increased. For this reason physicians should urge pregnant women\\r\\nto have their urine examined frequently, especially during the later\\r\\nmonths of pregnancy.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--Regulation of the diet; in pronounced cases the diet should\\r\\nconsist entirely of milk and the patient should take three or four quarts\\r\\nin twenty-four hours. Meats, pastry and sweets must be prohibited, but\\r\\nvegetables such as squash, spinach, salads may be added to the dietary in\\r\\nordinary cases. Vichy water may be taken alone or with the milk, and may\\r\\nbe taken freely. The bowels should be kept open with citrate of magnesia\\r\\n(one to two teaspoonfuls in water) or epsom salts in peppermint water.\\r\\nExercise in the open air can be taken in moderation. Warm clothing should\\r\\nbe worn and flannel next the skin; exposure to cold and draughts should be\\r\\ncarefully avoided. If the more special symptoms appear, such as persistent\\r\\nheadache, vertigo, ringing in the ears, black or bright spots floating\\r\\nbefore the eyes, dimness of vision, an abortion of miscarriage should be\\r\\ninduced without delay. Fortunately such cases are rare and with care from\\r\\nthe beginning seldom occur. Pregnant women should inform their family\\r\\nphysician at the beginning of pregnancy of their condition, and in the\\r\\ngreat majority of cases serious troubles can be prevented. Physicians\\r\\nexpect this information and receive it as a matter of course, and no woman\\r\\nshould hesitate to inform her physician either personally or through her\\r\\nhusband.\\r\\n\\r\\n[OBSTETRICS OR MIDWIFERY 525]\\r\\n\\r\\nAbortion, Miscarriage, Premature Labor. (Accidents of pregnancy).--These\\r\\nthree terms indicate a premature expulsion of the products of conception.\\r\\nLet us medically define these terms as follows; Abortion implies expulsion\\r\\nof the foetus before the sixteenth week. Miscarriage, the expulsion\\r\\nbetween the sixteenth and twenty-eighth weeks. Premature labor designates\\r\\nthe time of expulsion as between the twenty-eighth week to within a few\\r\\nweeks before the normal termination of pregnancy. Miscarriage is the term\\r\\npopularly used for the accidental loss of the products of conception.\\r\\nAbortion, in the popular mind, expresses the intentional loss of the\\r\\nproducts of conception. Abortion in the medical sense, takes place about\\r\\nonce in every four or five pregnancies. It occurs more frequently in those\\r\\nwho have borne children, occurring generally in the third or fourth\\r\\npregnancy, or toward the end of the child-bearing period, and it takes\\r\\nplace more frequently between the ninth and sixteenth week, when the\\r\\nafter- birth is in process of formation; and it is more liable to occur at\\r\\nthe time of the month when the normal menstruation would be due. It should\\r\\nbe borne in mind also that abortion occurring at this period is quite\\r\\ndangerous to the mother\\'s future health, and also dangerous to life; so\\r\\nthat at the first indication of abortion a physician should be called for\\r\\nthis trouble, because it needs care, both to prevent it and to assist the\\r\\nwoman to a successful ending when it is impossible to prevent it. This is\\r\\nmore dangerous to life than confinement at full term, and is apt to leave\\r\\nbehind a tendency to recurrence at the same time in the future\\r\\npregnancies, and also makes the woman liable to inflammatory conditions of\\r\\nthe womb.\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses.--Abortion may be induced by many causes due to the mother, father,\\r\\nand child. Among maternal causes may be mentioned any serious disease,\\r\\nespecially fevers, when accompanied by a rash on the skin, such as\\r\\nsmallpox, measles, scarlet fever. It is hard for a pregnant woman to go\\r\\nthrough one of these diseases, without having an abortion. Syphilis,\\r\\ntuberculosis, malaria, organic heart and kidney disease, diabetes, anemia,\\r\\nand systemic poisoning also are causes; nervous disturbances as shock,\\r\\nfright, sorrow, convulsions, chorea; mechanical causes, violent exercise,\\r\\nlifting, blows, falls, coughing, vomiting; local causes, as wrong position\\r\\nof the womb, inflammation of the womb, etc.; all are causes.\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses. Due to the Father. Paternal.--Syphilis, alcoholism, lead\\r\\npoisoning, excessive venery, extremes of youth or old age.\\r\\n\\r\\nFoetal Causes.--Disease of the after-birth, other parts, of cord, death of\\r\\nthe foetus, placenta pravia, and yet many women are subjected to falls,\\r\\nblows, etc., who carry their child to full term.\\r\\n\\r\\n[526 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--These vary with the period of pregnancy where they occur. In\\r\\nthe earlier months the symptoms are those of profuse menstruation,\\r\\nsometimes accompanied by more pain perhaps than usual. The ovum is then so\\r\\nsmall that it escapes notice. In the profuse flow there may be\\r\\nunaccustomed clots of blood; when this trouble occurs later in pregnancy\\r\\nthere are two constant symptoms which, together with the history of the\\r\\ncase, render the diagnosis easy. These prominent and constant symptoms are\\r\\npain and bleeding. The symptoms may be preceded by a bearing down feeling\\r\\nin the lower abdomen, with backache, frequent calls to pass urine, and a\\r\\ndischarge from the vagina, that is a mixture of mucus and water. After\\r\\nthese symptoms last for a shorter or longer time, labor pains set in, the\\r\\nbleeding increases and the contents of the womb are discharged. The ovum\\r\\nmay be expelled whole when it looks like a huge blood clot, or it may be\\r\\nexpelled partly and the membranes left behind; or the embryo (child)\\r\\nalone, surrounded by the transparent membrane, escapes.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the after-birth has formed it may be cast off entire or piecemeal. The\\r\\nembryo (child) alone may escape, the neck of the womb contracts and shuts;\\r\\nbleeding persists for an indefinite period, for weeks and weeks, until the\\r\\nhealth of the poor woman is seriously affected. Persistent bleeding of\\r\\nthis kind is almost always due to the retention of portions of the\\r\\nafter-birth or membranes, and should prove to the woman that there is a\\r\\nserious condition existing which should be speedily corrected. A physician\\r\\nshould be called who should make a thorough examination; and if such a\\r\\ncondition as above described is found, should free the womb from its\\r\\nretained products, which are not only sapping the woman\\'s life, but also\\r\\nrendering the future health of the womb very uncertain.\\r\\n\\r\\nThreatened Abortion.--If a bleeding takes place in the woman who is\\r\\npregnant, abortion may be assumed to threaten; a careful examination will\\r\\nusually settle this matter.\\r\\n\\r\\nInevitable Abortion.--The abortion is probably inevitable if the bleeding\\r\\nbecomes persistent and free, the cervix softens, the womb dilates and the\\r\\nlabor pains set in. Still in spite of all these conditions, the bleeding\\r\\nand pain may cease, and the pregnancy go on to full term, The result of\\r\\nthese cases, if carefully and properly treated, is favorable as far as the\\r\\nmother is concerned.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment. Preventive. In women where repeated abortions have occurred,\\r\\nthe cause should be diligently sought for. If syphilis exists the\\r\\ntreatment should be begun at the beginning of pregnancy. But when no\\r\\nspecial cause can be found, and an irritable condition of the womb is\\r\\nsuspected to be present, the patient must be kept quiet in bed, especially\\r\\nat the time when menstruation would normally occur. She should also be\\r\\nguarded against lifting, fright, worry, over-exertion; and medicines like\\r\\nbromide of potash, five to fifteen grains at a dose, given to quiet and\\r\\nallay the nervous irritability.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment of Threatened Abortion.--The patient should go to bed, lie down\\r\\nand remain there, and if possible be not only quiet physically, but also\\r\\nquiet mentally. The main remedy is opium, and if necessary to obtain a\\r\\nquick action it can be given hypodermically in the form of morphine.\\r\\nOtherwise, laudanum may be given by the mouth, twenty drops, repeated\\r\\ncautiously, every three or four hours as required, or it can be given in\\r\\nthirty-drop doses combined with a couple of ounces of starch water by the\\r\\nrectum. Extract of opium in pill form, one grain three times a day by the\\r\\nmonth; or a suppository of opium, one grain, may be inserted into the\\r\\nrectum every four to six hours. After the bleeding and pain have ceased,\\r\\nthe emergency is probably passed; but rest in bed and quiet should be the\\r\\nroutine for one or more weeks, and the patient should always rest in bed\\r\\nat the usual time of the menstrual period, during the remainder of the\\r\\npregnancy.\\r\\n\\r\\n[OBSTETRICS OR MIDWIFERY 527]\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment of the Inevitable Abortion.--If the cervix is hard and the canal\\r\\nis not dilated, especially if the bleeding is free, the vagina should be\\r\\npacked full at once, if possible, with iodoform gauze. Rolls five yards\\r\\nlong and two inches wide can be bought perfectly adapted to this purpose.\\r\\nA speculum should be used (Sims\\' or Graves\\') and the gauze should first be\\r\\npacked tightly into corners (fornices) around the cervix, then over the\\r\\ncervix and well down to the outlet. This should be held in place by a\\r\\nproper (T) bandage. The gauze can be removed in from twelve to twenty-four\\r\\nhours, and the ovum will generally be found lying upon the upper part of\\r\\nthe packing, or in the canal that is now dilated, from which it can easily\\r\\nbe removed. Sometimes it is necessary to repack and allow it to remain for\\r\\nanother twelve hours as the canal has not been sufficiently dilated by the\\r\\nfirst packing. This packing not only causes the canal to dilate but\\r\\nusually stops the bleeding. After the ovum has been expelled an antiseptic\\r\\nvaginal douche should be given twice a day for a week or longer.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf at the first examination the cervix is found softened and the mouth of\\r\\nthe womb is open, but the womb has not yet expelled its contents, the\\r\\nsterile (clean) finger may be introduced into the womb and the ovum and\\r\\nmembranes loosened and taken away, while this is being done counter\\r\\npressure should be made over the abdomen. After the womb has been cleared\\r\\nof all its contents an antiseptic solution should be used, carefully, in\\r\\nthe womb to wash it out, and this followed by washing out of the vagina.\\r\\nThe after treatment is the same as that for labor at full term. The woman\\r\\nshould remain in bed at least ten days.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlacenta Praevia.--The after-birth is placed in the lower part of the\\r\\nwomb; (after-birth before the child). This is a dangerous condition and\\r\\nterrible bleeding may occur. It occurs about one time out of every one\\r\\nthousand. The main symptom is bleeding and this may occur at any period of\\r\\npregnancy. It usually appears from the seventh to the ninth month. The\\r\\noutset is without any appreciable reason and without pain. The amount of\\r\\nblood lost at the first attack may be so slight as to escape notice or\\r\\ncopious enough to endanger the life of the mother. This flow may occur at\\r\\nany time during these months, and it may be small or great. If during the\\r\\ncourse of pregnancy the bleeding occurs at intervals in the increasing\\r\\namount, the greater will be the loss of blood during the labor.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--There is little danger of dangerous bleeding before the\\r\\nseventh month, and a waiting treatment may be adopted, but the woman\\r\\nshould be closely watched and told what the trouble is, so she will be\\r\\nwilling to remain quiet. Rest in bed, the avoidance of all muscular\\r\\nexercise and quieting medicines may enable the mother to carry the child\\r\\nuntil it can live, when pregnancy must be quickly terminated. If the child\\r\\nis dead the womb must be emptied at once. After the seventh month an\\r\\nexpectant treatment is no longer allowable, and authorities declare the\\r\\npregnancy should be terminated without delay. The mother is in great\\r\\ndanger from sudden free flow. This treatment must be given by an\\r\\nexperienced hand and only a physician can do it. If the pregnancy is\\r\\nallowed to continue to full term the danger to the woman is very great, as\\r\\nthe mortality runs from thirty to sixty-five per cent; but under modern\\r\\ntreatment it has been brought down to five to ten per cent. The death rate\\r\\nof the child is between fifty and seventy-five per cent.\\r\\n\\r\\n[528 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nLabor.--Labor may be defined as the physiological termination of pregnancy\\r\\nwhereby the mature foetus (child) and its appendages (after-birth, etc.),\\r\\nare separated from the maternal organism.\\r\\n\\r\\nPremonitory Signs of Labor.--Premonitory signs of labor, usually observed\\r\\nfrom one to two weeks before the onset of the labor pains, is a sinking\\r\\ndown of the womb in the abdomen, whereby some of the unpleasant features\\r\\nof pregnancy are relieved, and the so-called \"lightening\" takes place. The\\r\\nwaist line becomes small, the breathing is easier and the general\\r\\nwell-being of the woman is better, so that her friends are attracted by\\r\\nher feeling of relief. But as a result of the womb descent and the\\r\\nconsequent pressure, irritation of the bladder and rectum may occur, and\\r\\nshe may have frequent calls to empty these organs. The vagina secretes\\r\\nmore actively, the veins enlarge, some dropsy may appear in the\\r\\nextremities, and the womb contractions of pregnancy, which have been\\r\\npainless, begin to cause more and more discomfort.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese false pains recur at regular intervals of hours or even days, and\\r\\ngenerally at night, last for a varying period and usually disappear in the\\r\\nmorning. They often deceive the woman and lead her to the belief that the\\r\\nlabor has already begun; but examination of the cervix will reveal that\\r\\nthis is not so. It is well to bear in mind that the true labor pains\\r\\nusually begin in the back, extend down to the thighs and often around to\\r\\nthe front and they recur at regular intervals, and with increasing\\r\\nintensity.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe beginning of labor is characterized by recurring pains at regular\\r\\nintervals and of increasing severity. There is also a discharge from the\\r\\nvagina of mucus, and this is sometimes tinged with blood, \"the show.\" If\\r\\nan examination is now made, it will be found that the cervix (neck of the\\r\\nwomb) is shortened, and that the mouth of the womb is beginning to dilate.\\r\\nAt the beginning, the pains are usually in the back and spread to the\\r\\nabdomen and down the thighs; but they may be felt first in the abdomen.\\r\\nThey return every half hour or twenty minutes, but as labor goes on the\\r\\ninterval is shortened, so that toward the end of the second stage when the\\r\\nchild is being born, they appear to be continuous, and the patient feels\\r\\nas if she is encircled by a belt of pain; however, with all this, she will\\r\\nbear the suffering easier and better for she knows that progress is being\\r\\nmade, and that she will soon be over the pains and the child born. A pain\\r\\nrarely lasts more than one minute.\\r\\n\\r\\n[OBSTETRICS OR MIDWIFERY 529]\\r\\n\\r\\nSTAGES OF LABOR.--First stage extends from the beginning of labor until\\r\\nthe mouth of the womb is dilated. Second stage, from the complete dilation\\r\\nuntil the complete birth of the child. Third stage, from the birth of the\\r\\nchild until the expulsions of the after-birth--Placenta.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe First Stage.--The first stage varies greatly in different women. The\\r\\naverage duration of this stage is from ten to fourteen hours in the woman\\r\\nwith the first child, and six to eight hours in the woman who has borne\\r\\nchildren. During this stage the woman prefers to remain on her feet, sit,\\r\\nstand or walk about. The amount of pain experienced varies greatly,\\r\\naccording to the temperament of the patient; in nervous women it may be\\r\\nexcessive. The pains now have nothing of that bearing down character which\\r\\nthey afterward acquire; they are described as \"grinding,\" are usually felt\\r\\nin the front. The genitals become bathed with secretions, which are\\r\\nsometimes tinged with blood. This is an especially trying period to a\\r\\nyoung wife, for she cannot see that the pains are doing any good, only\\r\\nmaking her restless, tired and nervous. Little can be done by the\\r\\nphysician in this stage except to encourage and explain what is really\\r\\nbeing accomplished by these seemingly futile pains and by tact and proper\\r\\nencouragement, a physician tides this stage over and gives great comfort\\r\\nto the needy patient. This stage ends with the opening and dilation of the\\r\\nmouth of the womb and the second or expulsive stage sets in, with pains\\r\\naltered in character.\\r\\n\\r\\nSecond Stage.--The pains now become more frequent and severe and last\\r\\nlonger, and the patient now manifests a strong desire to expel the\\r\\ncontents of the womb. The woman now feels better in bed and when the pains\\r\\ncome she involuntarily bears down, with each contraction she sets her\\r\\nteeth, takes a deep breath, fixes the diaphragm, contracts the muscles of\\r\\nthe abdomen and bears down hard if you allow her to do so. The knowledge\\r\\nthat she is working to overcome an obstacle gives her some satisfaction\\r\\nand she feels that she is accomplishing something by the efforts she is\\r\\nmaking. The physician can aid greatly by suggesting to the patient how to\\r\\nuse the pains and how much bearing down to do. He can tell her when not to\\r\\nbear down, and so save her strength for the next real pain when bearing\\r\\ndown will do good. Although the pains are really harder in this stage,\\r\\nnervous women suffer no more, for their mind is now concentrated upon the\\r\\nwork at hand. Sometimes at the beginning of this stage the patient feels\\r\\nchilly or has a severe chill; a hot drink and more covering counteract\\r\\nthis. Another phenomena is the escape of the waters and a lull in the\\r\\npains for a little time, when they come on more effectively than before as\\r\\nthe womb contracts down upon the child and is not hindered by the \"bag of\\r\\nwater.\" The pains keep on at intervals until the child is born and the\\r\\nphysician can now be of help by guiding, directing and assisting the birth\\r\\nof the head. This stage averages about two hours.\\r\\n\\r\\n[530 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nThird Stage.--The birth of the head is very soon followed by the shoulders\\r\\nand the rest of the body, and the woman is now at comparative rest. The\\r\\ncord is now tied and cut and the child laid away, if all right, in a warm\\r\\nplace until it can be washed and dressed. Following the birth of the child\\r\\nthere is a short resting period, the contractions of the womb cease and it\\r\\nbecomes smaller through retraction. After a few minutes the pains begin\\r\\nagain, the after-birth separates from its attachment in the womb, and\\r\\ntogether with the membranes is extruded into the vaginal canal and vulvar\\r\\nopening; whence it can be easily delivered by pressing upon the abdomen\\r\\nover the lump (womb) and by guiding the after-birth with the cord. This\\r\\nshould be done slowly so that the membranes will all come away with the\\r\\nafter-birth.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis should always be examined to be certain that everything has come\\r\\naway. A greater or less amount of clots of blood come with the\\r\\nafter-birth. The contraction of the womb stops the bleeding, one hand\\r\\nshould be kept on the abdomen over the womb, to see that it remains hard\\r\\nand retracted. The womb moves under the hand. If it softens, gentle\\r\\nrubbing should be kept up and the womb will soon remain contracted. This\\r\\nstage averages about fifteen minutes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMANAGEMENT OF LABOR.--Preparation of the Bed.--The bed should be high,\\r\\nsprings not soft, with a firm and smooth mattress. It should be placed so\\r\\nthat both sides are accessible. The bed should be made up on the right\\r\\nside as a rule, as the woman usually lies on her left side when delivered.\\r\\nPlace a rubber, or an oil cloth sheet, over the mattress, and over this an\\r\\nordinary muslin sheet and secure this with safety pins to the corners of\\r\\nthe mattress. This is the permanent bed; on top of this is the second\\r\\nrubber sheet and this is covered with another muslin sheet and both held\\r\\nby safety pins. This is the temporary bed. Plenty of hot and cold boiled\\r\\nwater should also be at hand. Frequently only a temporary bed is made with\\r\\nrubber or oil cloth underneath, blanket and sheet above this. They should\\r\\nbe fastened so that the movements of the woman will not disorder them.\\r\\nThese can be removed after the confinement and new, clean warm clothes put\\r\\nin their place. The objection to this is the woman may be too tired to be\\r\\nmoved, while, with the permanent and temporary bed arrangement she need\\r\\nnot be moved at all, only lifted, while the temporary bed is being removed\\r\\nand she is then let down easily upon clean bedding.\\r\\n\\r\\nPreparation of the Patient.--The patient, if she desires, can take a full\\r\\nbath. The bowels should be moved thoroughly with a soap and water\\r\\ninjection so that the rectum will be fully emptied. This makes labor not\\r\\nonly easier, but pleasanter, as no feces will be discharged during labor.\\r\\nThe bladder should also be emptied. The external organs should be\\r\\nscrupulously cleansed and bathed with some antiseptic solution, like\\r\\nglycothymoline, listerine, borolyptol, etc. A fresh suit of underwear may\\r\\nthen be put on and over this a loose wrapper.\\r\\n\\r\\n[OBSTETRICS OR MIDWIFERY  531]\\r\\n\\r\\nExamination of the Patient.--The physician needs to satisfy himself as to\\r\\nthe position of the child, etc. This can be done by an examination of the\\r\\nabdomen and also of the vagina. He must determine whether the child is\\r\\nalive, its position, the condition of the cervix and mouth of the womb. In\\r\\nmaking such examination a routine plan should be adopted. The coat must be\\r\\nremoved, the shirt sleeves turned up and the hands and arms washed with\\r\\nsoap and water. The abdomen should be thoroughly palpated (felt) and\\r\\nlistened to with the ear or stethoscope to determine the character of the\\r\\nchild\\'s heart beat, whether it be very slow, one hundred and twenty or\\r\\nless, or a very rapid one, one hundred and fifty or more. It may indicate\\r\\ndanger to the child and necessitate a hurried delivery. After these things\\r\\nhave been done, the hands and arms must again be thoroughly washed and\\r\\nsterilized, the fingers anointed with carbolated vaselin and the\\r\\nexamination of the vagina made.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis cleanliness is necessary, and if this plan were carried out by\\r\\neveryone connected with the patient during the whole confinement, there\\r\\nwould be fewer cases of \"child-bed\" fever, with its resultant diseases.\\r\\nThe patient should lie on her back with the knees drawn up. There is no\\r\\nneed for any exposure now, for the covering can be held up by an attendant\\r\\nso that it will not touch the physician\\'s hands. The soft parts are now\\r\\nseparated by the fingers of one hand while the examining fingers are\\r\\nintroduced into the vagina. These fingers should never touch any external\\r\\npart and especially the parts near the anus. If the cervix is found to be\\r\\nlong and the canal still undilated, or only slightly so, and especially if\\r\\nit is the first child (primipara), the physician\\'s presence is not needed\\r\\nand he may safely leave for an hour or two. But if the mouth (os) of the\\r\\nwomb is dilated to the size of a silver dollar he should on no account\\r\\nleave the house.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrequent examination of the vagina should not be made. In ordinary cases\\r\\nduring the first stage, the woman should be up and encouraged to walk\\r\\nabout the room, to sit or assume any comfortable position. During a pain\\r\\nshe may stand beside the bed resting her hands upon something or kneel in\\r\\nfront of the bed or chair. The standing position assists in the birth. The\\r\\nbladder should be emptied frequently, as a distended bladder retards labor\\r\\nand may even stop the womb contractions. The pains become more frequent\\r\\nand severe as the end of this stage approaches and each contraction is now\\r\\naccompanied by straining or a bearing down effort on the part of the\\r\\nwoman, and as a rule the membranes rupture spontaneously about this time.\\r\\nAn examination of the vagina should now be made with the woman in bed, and\\r\\nif the membranes have not broken and the womb is completely dilated as\\r\\nshown during the pain, they may be ruptured by pressing against them with\\r\\na finger-nail during a pain. Sometimes we use every means to retain the\\r\\nmembranes intact, but that is when protection for the child is needed for\\r\\nsometime longer. If the suffering is very severe, during this stage,\\r\\nfifteen grains of chloral hydrate, well diluted with water, may be given\\r\\nevery fifteen or thirty minutes until sixty grains have been given. (This\\r\\nmedicine should never be given to a person with heart trouble). I find one\\r\\ndrop doses of the tincture of Gelsemium every fifteen to thirty minutes of\\r\\nbenefit, especially if the womb does not dilate well, or the patient is\\r\\nvery nervous. The patient may receive and can receive light nourishment\\r\\nduring this stage.\\r\\n\\r\\n[532 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nManagement of the Second Stage.--After the rupture of the membranes the\\r\\nlabor proceeds faster and a termination may be expected within a\\r\\nreasonable time. There is a short lull in the pains, usually, after the\\r\\nwaters have escaped and during this time the patient should remove her\\r\\nclothing and put on a night dress, and to prevent its being soiled roll it\\r\\nwell up under the arms and retain it there. After labor it can be very\\r\\neasily pulled down and made comfortable for the patient. A folded, clean,\\r\\nsterile sheet is now placed about the body and extremities and held in\\r\\nplace by a cord around the waist. The opening in the sheet should be in\\r\\nthe right side, as this will allow the assistance being given as needed.\\r\\nThe powerful force of the abdominal muscles is now brought into action;\\r\\nthe force is best utilized with the woman lying on her back.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe should now be encouraged to bear down during the pains and she will be\\r\\ngreatly assisted by pulling on a sheet or long towel tied to the foot of\\r\\nthe bed, or by holding the hand of the nurse. A support for her feet\\r\\nfrequently aids the woman. Pressing low on her back relieves her to some\\r\\nextent. In the intervals between the pains she should rest, do nothing,\\r\\nand be perfectly passive. It is now that an anesthetic may be used to\\r\\nrelieve the suffering. She should not be put completely under its\\r\\ninfluence for that is not only unnecessary, but injurious. Chloroform when\\r\\nused should be given on a handkerchief opened and loosely held over the\\r\\nwoman\\'s face, and administered drop by drop on the handkerchief. The\\r\\nhandkerchief should be placed over the face at the beginning of the pain\\r\\nand be taken away as soon as the pain is stopped. The woman inhales the\\r\\nchloroform during the pains and their sharpness is blunted. Given in that\\r\\nway it is not considered dangerous. It should only be pushed to\\r\\nunconsciousness during a forceps delivery, and even then it is not always\\r\\nnecessary to render the woman unconscious. I have used the forceps without\\r\\ngiving an anesthetic. They should be placed without causing any special\\r\\npain, and assist in delivery without causing any more pain when the head\\r\\nis down low. Of course if the forceps must be used when the head is high\\r\\nup a greater amount of anesthetic is needed.\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Manton, of Detroit, says:--\"The dangers of anesthetics are the same\\r\\nwhen employed for obstetric purposes as in surgery, and then use should be\\r\\ngoverned by the same rules in each instance.\" As soon as the head begins\\r\\nto dilate the vulvar opening, the patient should be turned on her left\\r\\nside with her knees drawn up and her body lying diagonally across the bed,\\r\\nwith the buttocks close to and parallel with the edge. This position\\r\\nallows the physician to give better assistance and is no harder for the\\r\\npatient.\\r\\n\\r\\n[OBSTETRICS OR MIDWIFERY 533]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe physician with his hands thoroughly sterilized and with a clean\\r\\nsterilized gown, seats himself on the edge of the bed and watches the\\r\\nprogress of the labor, ready to assist the woman at any moment. And at\\r\\nthis time he can do much by words of encouragement and proper directions\\r\\nto the laboring woman how to use her pains so as to get the most from\\r\\nthem; and also by manipulation of the soft parts and the head. The head\\r\\nadvances more and more with each succeeding pain, and the perineum is put\\r\\non the stretch, each contraction is followed by a resting pause during\\r\\nwhich the head slips back a little and relieves the perineum. Tear of the\\r\\nperineum is liable to take place when the head is about to escape through\\r\\nthe vulvar opening, especially if the contractions are strong, the woman\\r\\nbears down forcibly and the interval between the pains is short, so that\\r\\nthe head is forced out before the parts have time to completely dilate and\\r\\nsoften. Here is where the physician\\'s work comes in, by holding the head\\r\\nback and fully flexed (bent), chin upon the breast, and keeping the back\\r\\nof the head (occiput) well up towards the bone in front (pubic arch) until\\r\\nthc perineum is completely dilated.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe effect of the pains can be lessened, if necessary, also, by telling\\r\\nthe woman to open her mouth and not to bear down during the pain for a few\\r\\ntimes. In this way the perineum will dilate properly and be torn little,\\r\\nif at all, and perhaps much future trouble for the woman saved. I always\\r\\ntell my patient why I ask her to do certain things in labor and I have\\r\\nnever found any woman who, when able, was not willing to do as I asked. A\\r\\ntorn perineum is not desirable, because even when sewn up immediately\\r\\nafter labor, it may not unite thoroughly, and thus cause displacements of\\r\\nthe womb in the future. A little time and care at the time of labor will\\r\\nsave the perineum and every woman is willing to do her share when the\\r\\nconditions are plainly explained to her. It takes only a few minutes\\r\\nlonger, and only a few more pains to bear. When the head begins to stretch\\r\\nthe opening, the left hand of the physician should be carried over the\\r\\nwoman\\'s abdomen and between the thighs, her right leg being supported by a\\r\\npillow placed between her knees, and this left hand presses the back of\\r\\nthe head (occiput) forward and against the \"pubic arch.\" The right hand\\r\\nmay also press the head upward by being placed against the posterior\\r\\nportion of the dilated perineum. The edge of the perineum should now be\\r\\nclosely watched. A small towel wrung out of a bowl of hot water placed\\r\\nhandy on a chair, should be held constantly against the perineum to hasten\\r\\nthe softening and dilatation of these tissues. Plenty of hot water and\\r\\nsmall towels should be at hand. The head advances with each pain and again\\r\\nrecedes until the parts are properly dilated, and the perineum slips\\r\\nbackward over the child\\'s face.\\r\\n\\r\\n[534 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES ]\\r\\n\\r\\nIf torn, it should be sewed before the physician leaves, as it can be done\\r\\neasily and without pain to the mother. As the head of the child emerges,\\r\\nthe anesthetic should be pushed, or the woman told to open her mouth and\\r\\ncry out. This lessens the pain and the child\\'s head emerges slower, and\\r\\nthe perineum is saved. The child\\'s head should be received in the hand.\\r\\nAfter the head is born, there is a lull for a few moments. Then the\\r\\nshoulders rotate into the proper position and are easily born. There may\\r\\nthen be a flow of watery fluid for a few seconds. Before this time the\\r\\nphysician has examined to see whether the cord is around the child\\'s neck,\\r\\nreleased it if it has been, and also cleaned out the child\\'s mouth. The\\r\\nchild usually cries a little about this time and it is soon seen whether\\r\\nit needs quick attention. The perineum should be guarded also while the\\r\\nshoulders are being born as it can be torn by them. The shoulders are\\r\\ngenerally born without any help. The child\\'s head is held in the\\r\\nphysician\\'s hand. As soon as the body is born, the child should be laid\\r\\nupon the bed behind the mother\\'s thighs, and the cord pulled down to\\r\\nprevent it pulling upon the after-birth. After the beating in the cord has\\r\\nceased, generally from five to ten minutes have elapsed, the cord is then\\r\\ntied, tight enough so it will not bleed afterward, about one or one and\\r\\none half inches (some say more) from the body and tied a second time an\\r\\ninch or so from the first ligature, and the cord cut between the two\\r\\nligatures. Care should be taken so as not to cut a finger or toe of the\\r\\nbaby. If the cord is very thick it is best to pinch it at the point of\\r\\ntying and the contents stripped away before the first ligature is applied.\\r\\nAfter the cord is cut it should be wiped off to determine that bleeding\\r\\nfrom the vessels has been permanently cut off, and if not it should be\\r\\ntied again. The child is now taken up by placing the back of its neck in\\r\\nthe hollow between the thumb and forefinger, and the other hand over the\\r\\nbackbone. It should then be placed in a warm receiving blanket, and put in\\r\\na safe place.\\r\\n\\r\\nManagement of the Third Stage,--The contractions of the womb are renewed\\r\\nand with the second or third the after-birth may be expressed. The top\\r\\n(fundus) of the womb is grasped by the hand through the relaxed abdominal\\r\\nwalls, and squeezed, and at the same time make a downward pressure. The\\r\\nafter-birth is loosened from the womb and slides through the vagina and\\r\\noutlet, and it may be caught in a tray which has been placed between the\\r\\npatient\\'s legs, or by the hand and given a few twists in order to roll the\\r\\nmembranes together; while this is being done, gentle rubbing should be\\r\\napplied to the womb, when the membranes will slip out without tearing; no\\r\\ndrawing on the cord should be done in delivering the after-birth.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the time of the birth of the head to the delivery of the after-birth\\r\\nthe womb must be controlled by the firm pressure of the hand on the\\r\\nabdomen. It is well for the nurse, when the after-birth is separating from\\r\\nthe womb to follow the womb, throughout this whole stage, by keeping her\\r\\nhand upon it and if, while the physician is attending to the child, the\\r\\nwomb softens and enlarges she should at once notify him. There may be\\r\\nbleeding within the womb. After the womb is empty, friction should be made\\r\\nover the womb whenever it softens at all in order to stimulate the womb to\\r\\nperfect contraction, and it should be kept up at intervals for one hour\\r\\nafter the after-birth and membranes have been delivered.\\r\\n\\r\\n[OBSTETRICS OR MIDWIFERY 535]\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE CHILD.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe eyes should be washed soon and normal respiration established. If the\\r\\nchild does not breathe well, cold water may be sprinkled in the face and\\r\\nchest and if this fails, immersions in hot water at 106 degrees F., and\\r\\nsprinkling with cold water must be resorted to. If necessary, artificial\\r\\nrespiration must be given. Slap the child on the back and move the arms up\\r\\nand down by the side a few times, or breathing into the child\\'s mouth.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother method.--Face the child\\'s back, put an index finger in each\\r\\narm-pit and the thumbs over the shoulders, so that their ends over-lap the\\r\\ncollar-bone and rest on the front of the chest, the rest of the fingers\\r\\ngoing obliquely over the back of the chest. The child is suspended\\r\\nperpendicularly between the operator\\'s knees. Its whole weight now hangs\\r\\non the first fingers in the arm-pit; by these means the ribs are lifted,\\r\\nthe chest is expanded and inspiration is mechanically produced. The infant\\r\\nis now swung upward till the operative\\'s hands are just above the\\r\\nhorizontal line, when the motion is abruptly, but carefully, arrested. The\\r\\nmomentum causes the lower limbs and pelvis of the infant to topple over\\r\\ntoward the operator. The greater part of the weight now rests on the\\r\\nthumbs, which press on the front of the chest, while the abdominal organs\\r\\npress upon the diaphragm. By these two factors, the chest is compressed\\r\\nand we get expiration, mechanically. After five seconds the first position\\r\\nis resumed again, and the lungs expand and fill with air. This process may\\r\\nbe repeated several times until the breathing seems to be going naturally,\\r\\nand with delicate infants it should be the last resort.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the breathing has been established the child should be wrapped in a\\r\\nwarm flannel with hot water bags or cans near it, and left until the\\r\\nmother has been cared for. Infants at birth are covered with a white\\r\\ngreasy substance, vernix caseosa, or cheesy varnish; it is removed by\\r\\napplying olive oil, vaselin or fresh lard, and afterward rubbing the skin\\r\\ngently with a soft cloth. The eyes and mouth should be washed out with\\r\\npure warm water--or a saturated solution of boric acid, used. Separate\\r\\nsquares of soft linen being used for this purpose. If the baby is born too\\r\\nsoon or is very small, weak and undeveloped, it should be given an oil\\r\\nbath, only, and then wrapped in cotton wool and kept at a temperature of\\r\\nnot less than 80 degrees F., for ten days or two weeks.\\r\\n\\r\\n[536 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nTo a fully developed child the first bath may be given at once. Have\\r\\neverything ready before beginning, a foot tub, warm soft towels, warm\\r\\nwater, castile soap, olive oil or vaselin, small squares of muslin or\\r\\nlinen, dusting powder, a dressing for the navel and clothing, the latter\\r\\nconsisting of a diaper, a flannel band, a shirt, long woolen stockings, a\\r\\nloose long sleeved flannel petticoat and a simple soft white outside\\r\\ngarment, the two last, long enough to more than cover the feet. The infant\\r\\nshould be wrapped in flannel and only the part which is being bathed at\\r\\nthe moment should be exposed. The eyes are first bathed separately and\\r\\nwith different cloths, and afterward the face, no soap being used; the\\r\\nhead is then washed with warm water; very little soap should be used with\\r\\ninfants as it is more or less irritating, and it is likely to injure the\\r\\nfine texture of the skin. Next, one should carefully clean the parts\\r\\nbehind the ears and the crevices of the neck, arm-pits and joints and\\r\\nthose between the buttocks and the thighs, and it is well to notice if all\\r\\nthe natural openings are perfect; finally the baby is put down into the\\r\\ntub of warm water at about 96 degrees F., and washed off, with the head\\r\\nand back firmly supported with the left arm and hand during the bath. The\\r\\nbaby is lifted out in a minute of two, held face downward for a moment and\\r\\nrinsed off with clean warm water. It is then wrapped in a warm towel and\\r\\nflannel and dried by patting, not rubbing. It is best to do all this on a\\r\\ntable, instead of on the lap, and it should be large enough to hold a bath\\r\\ntub, every thing necessary for the bath and a pillow upon which to place\\r\\nthe baby. Everything then can be done without stooping and with greater\\r\\ncomfort to the child. Powder should not be used except where there are\\r\\nsigns of chafing, when stearate of zinc is the best to use.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe navel is then dressed. A hole is cut in the center of a square of\\r\\nsterilized lint or linen which is slipped over the cord and folded about\\r\\nit; the cord is then laid toward the left side, and over it is put a small\\r\\nsterilized cotton pad which is held in place by the flannel bandage and\\r\\njust tight enough to hold. The binder may be kept on by sewing it smoothly\\r\\nwith half a dozen large stitches, thus doing away with any danger of being\\r\\ninjured from the pins. A binder should only be tight enough to hold the\\r\\ndressing for the navel. After the cord drops off the looser knitted band\\r\\nshould be used. The infant is not bathed in the tub again until after the\\r\\ncord has been dried up and ready to drop off, which usually occurs on the\\r\\nfifth or sixth day, although it may not drop off for nine days. The cord\\r\\nshould not be redressed in the meantime. (See Baby Department for further\\r\\ndirections).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE MOTHER.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first duty of the physician, following the third stage of labor, is to\\r\\nsee that the womb is well contracted and control of this organ should be\\r\\ncontinued for at least one hour after delivery. This generally prevents\\r\\nexcessive loss of blood. If necessary to promote womb contraction one\\r\\nteaspoonful of ergot can be given. After the womb has been kept in a state\\r\\nof contraction, the room should be rid of all evidences of labor and the\\r\\nwoman made comfortable. The buttocks and thighs which have been soiled\\r\\nduring the labor should be bathed with warm water and soap and the\\r\\nexternal genitals sprayed with an antiseptic solution, then dried with\\r\\nsterile gauze or cotton, the dressing applied to the vulva and the\\r\\ntemporary bed removed, her night dress pulled down and the patient thus\\r\\nlying in a clean, comfortable bedding. The woman may then have a cup of\\r\\nweak tea, hot milk or broth and be left to rest; but during the first\\r\\nsleep the womb should be carefully watched lest it relax and serious, if\\r\\nnot fatal, bleeding occur. In a normal confinement the dressings need not\\r\\nbe changed, as a rule, oftener than six times in twenty-four hours, for\\r\\nthe first few days. As soon as convenient after the first toilet is\\r\\nfinished the physician sterilizes his hands and with the patient on her\\r\\nleft side introduces  one finger into the rectum and the thumb into the\\r\\nvagina to discover the condition of the perineum. Washing out of the\\r\\nvagina is not necessary as a rule.\\r\\n\\r\\n[OBSTETRICS OR MIDWIFERY 537]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe binder is considered indispensable, and should be made of unbleached\\r\\nmuslin and wide enough to extend from the pubic (bone) to the breast-bone,\\r\\nand long enough to go around the patient\\'s body and slightly lap. The\\r\\nbinder should be pinned or sewed tightest in the middle, but it should not\\r\\nbe so tight as to press upon the womb and crowd it backward or to either\\r\\nside. It acts as a splint to the muscles and assists in resting them to\\r\\ntheir natural condition.\\r\\n\\r\\nRest.--Complete rest of the body and mind is essential to the well being\\r\\nof the lying-in woman. She is better off without any company, and should\\r\\nsee no one except her family for the first week or two. Outside visitors\\r\\nshould be prohibited. The lying-in room should be kept free from noise and\\r\\nconfusion, and the patient should be protected from annoyances of every\\r\\nkind. She should remain lying on her back for a few days and immediately\\r\\nfollowing delivery she should not have a pillow for her head. Sleep is\\r\\nvery necessary and desirable, and mild medicines should be given to\\r\\nproduce it, if necessary. It is best not to sit up in the bed until the\\r\\nwomb shall have had time to become smaller, and has resumed its natural\\r\\nposition behind the pubis. Among the upper classes, when it takes the womb\\r\\nlonger to regain its normal size, three weeks is a good rule to go by\\r\\nbefore sitting up in the room, and she should remain in her room until the\\r\\nend of the fourth week. Among healthy women of the laboring class, whose\\r\\nmuscular system has not been injured by \"culture\" and social excesses, the\\r\\nwomb and appendages regain their normal proportions more rapidly; but even\\r\\nthey should remain in bed two weeks.\\r\\n\\r\\nAFTER-PAINS.--Women who have borne children frequently suffer from the\\r\\nafter-pains, occurring at irregular intervals, for two or three days and\\r\\nthey may give rise to much distress. A few drops of spirits of camphor on\\r\\na lump of sugar will often give relief when they are not severe. Also a\\r\\ndrop of tincture of blue cohosh taken every two or three hours is\\r\\nvaluable.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE BLADDER.--If the patient is not able to pass urine it should be drawn\\r\\nonce in eight or twelve hours or oftener if required. A No.7 rubber\\r\\ncatheter is best. After it has been used, it should be sterilized by\\r\\nboiling and then kept in a bichloride solution (1-2000). It should be\\r\\nwashed off with boiled water again before being used to remove the\\r\\nbichloride solution and greased with sterile oil. The parts should be\\r\\nexposed to pass the catheter, the labia separated by the finger and thumb,\\r\\nand the opening of the urethra and surrounding parts bathed clean with an\\r\\nantiseptic solution; unless you are clean decomposing discharges from the\\r\\nvagina may be introduced into the bladder and a cystitis set up. The care\\r\\nof the bladder is very important. It is not so sensitive after the labor\\r\\nand the woman may have urine when she does not think so. Sometimes she\\r\\npasses a little after trying and then thinks there is no more in the\\r\\nbladder. Even the attendants are deceived sometimes. I once had a case\\r\\nwhere the mother was the nurse. At each visit I inquired as to the amount\\r\\nof urine passed. I was told each time it was sufficient. She suffered\\r\\nseverely the second day in the evening. I went to see her and against the\\r\\nprotests of the mother I used the catheter and took away an enormous\\r\\nquantity of urine. In such cases the bladder should be emptied slowly to\\r\\nsave the woman from shock.\\r\\n\\r\\nA physician cannot always depend upon the patient\\'s knowledge of her\\r\\ncondition even in such matters and sometimes even the nurse is at fault.\\r\\n\\r\\n[538 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE BOWELS.--There should be a movement of the bowels the second or third\\r\\nday, and a soap and water enema containing a small teaspoonful of spirits\\r\\nof turpentine and one-half ounce of glycerin, will usually be sufficient.\\r\\nLater cascara cordial, castor oil, etc., may be used. Should the breasts\\r\\nbe much swollen and painful and fever arise, saline laxatives are needed\\r\\nfor two or three days, such as citrate of magnesia, rochelle salts,\\r\\nhunyadi water or seidlitz powder may be given.\\r\\n\\r\\nCare of the Breasts.--Careful attention should be given them from the\\r\\nfirst. The nipples should be bathed after labor, with an antiseptic lotion\\r\\n(bichloride, 1-2000), dried and then covered with castor oil, a small\\r\\nsquare of clean sterile gauze being laid over each to protect the\\r\\nclothing. Bathe the nipples before and after each nursing with a warm\\r\\nsaturated solution of boric acid and dry them carefully. The breasts may\\r\\nbe supported by a binder, made of a strip of muslin sufficiently wide to\\r\\nextend from above to well below the breasts. If they are heavy and sagging\\r\\nplace a layer of cotton at the outer border of each breast and they should\\r\\nbe raised toward the middle line, the binder being pinned only tight\\r\\nenough to hold without pressing upon them. The breasts should not be\\r\\npressed upon by anything. Shoulder straps can be pinned or sewed on the\\r\\nbinder if it has a tendency to slip down. Should the breasts be much\\r\\nswollen relief can be obtained by massage with warm olive oil and by the\\r\\nuse of a breast pump. The tips of the fingers only should be used in\\r\\ngiving massage and the stroke should be light, from the circumference to\\r\\nthe center. Roughness and pressure must be avoided.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nINFLAMMATION OF THE BREAST, Abscess; Broken Breast.--This usually results\\r\\nfrom germs. The breast inflames, the milk tubes are choked and distended,\\r\\nthere may be fever. There is sometimes severe local pain, hard swelling\\r\\nand an abscess forms and if this breaks it is called broken breast.\\r\\n\\r\\n[OBSTETRICS OR MIDWIFERY 539]\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment, Preventive.--Support breast with a binder. The milk should not\\r\\nbe allowed to accumulate and cake. The breasts and nipples should be kept\\r\\nclean and dry. Breast pump should be used if necessary to get out the\\r\\nsurplus milk. If the lumps continue and are painful, put cold applications\\r\\nto the breast. Have child nurse at the other breast. If it continues and\\r\\nwill suppurate, apply moist heat, such as fomentations or poultices, and\\r\\nthen open thoroughly. Poke root makes a splendid poultice for caked\\r\\nbreasts. I have great faith in it. At the same time I give of the tincture\\r\\none drop doses every hour. It is a splendid remedy and the poultice and\\r\\nremedy frequently stop the trouble. Inflammation of the breasts sometimes\\r\\noccurs in babies, generally in the first weeks. The swelling can be\\r\\nreduced by mild rubbing with warm carbolized oil used every day. Do not\\r\\nrub hard enough to hurt the baby. After the rubbing, absorbent cotton with\\r\\ncarbolized oil should be applied and cover all with a thick layer of\\r\\ncotton held on with adhesives. If the breasts form pus they must be\\r\\nopened.\\r\\n\\r\\nMOTHERS\\' REMEDIES. 1. Sore Breasts, a Never-Failing Remedy for.--\"Take a\\r\\npint of raw linseed oil and four ounces tincture of camphor, mix and apply\\r\\na cloth saturated in the liniment to the affected parts, taking care that\\r\\nthe whole surface of the inflamed parts is covered with the liniment. When\\r\\nthe breasts become swollen or painfully inflamed, apply the liniment often\\r\\nto prevent gathering.\" Even if they have gathered it is an excellent\\r\\noutward application. It allays pain, is extremely soothing and seldom\\r\\nfails to effect a cure.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Swollen Breasts, an Herb Treatment for.--\"Chamomile flowers one ounce,\\r\\nmarshmallow roots one ounce, bruise and boil in one quart of water down to\\r\\na pint. Foment the breast with this liquor as hot as can be borne; and\\r\\nthen place the flowers and roots in a cloth and apply as a poultice.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Sore Breasts, a Hot Poultice for.--\"Apply hot pancakes made of sour\\r\\nmilk, saleratus and wheat flour, large enough to cover affected parts.\\r\\nKeep them changed often enough, so they will not be cold. This is an\\r\\nexcellent remedy to steam out the inflammation.\" This is an old tried\\r\\nremedy and one to be relied upon. The steaming relieves the swelling and\\r\\ninflammation and gives relief quickly.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Caked Breasts, Fresh Hops for.--\"Fry one pint of fresh hops in a half\\r\\ncup of lard until the lard is a rich brown, then strain, set away to cool\\r\\nand use as a salve.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n5. Sore Breasts, a Poultice of Peach Leaves for.--\"Take enough peach tree\\r\\nleaves to mix well with meal and water to the consistency of a poultice.\"\\r\\nThis poultice should be applied hot, but should only be used in cases\\r\\nwhere the breast has matter or pus in it.\\r\\n\\r\\nMOTHERS\\' REMEDIES.--l. Sore Nipples, a Good Wash for.--\"Brandy and water\\r\\nmixed together and put on the nipples will harden them but should be\\r\\nwashed off before the child nurses. If they are cracked, apply glycerin\\r\\nwith starch, or arnica ointment.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Sore Nipples, Good Family Ointment for.--\"Four ounces of white wax, one\\r\\nounce bayberry wax, three ounces of spermaceti, one pint olive oil. Mix\\r\\nbriskly over a slow fire, taking care to stir it briskly until cool.\" This\\r\\nis an excellent ointment for mothers when troubled with sore nipples; it\\r\\nmoistens the skin and forms a coating. It is good for dry, scurvy, chapped\\r\\nhands, blotches on the face and all sores which require a mild ointment,\\r\\nbut should be assisted with internal remedies when the case requires it.\\r\\n\\r\\n[540 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Lochia.--By this term is meant the discharges from the womb and soft\\r\\nparts after labor. They are mixed with blood at first and contain dark\\r\\nclots, mucus, shreds of the after-birth and pieces of the membrane. They\\r\\nbecome paler in color from the end of the third to the sixth day. After\\r\\nthis the color is yellow, greenish and contains pus and fatty cells, with\\r\\na little blood. This discharge varies in different women. In those who\\r\\nmenstruate freely and do not nurse they are usually copious; when\\r\\ndecomposed, they smell badly and the odor is penetrating. The flow may\\r\\ncease entirely between the second and sixth week. It is increased by\\r\\nexertions at about the time the patient begins to move about.\\r\\n\\r\\nDiet.--This should consist at first of liquid, unstimulating food, given\\r\\nin small quantities and frequently. If the baby does not nurse, the\\r\\nliquids should be restricted. Some women on the first day can take milk,\\r\\nmilk toast, or if desired, dry or buttered toast with coffee, tea, weak\\r\\ncocoa, according to the patient\\'s taste. Water may be given if desired. On\\r\\nthe second and third days, simple soups or any of the following may be\\r\\nadded to the dietary: Meat broths, beef tea, soft boiled or poached eggs,\\r\\nraw or stewed oysters (no vinegar or spices) and some simple dessert, such\\r\\nas boiled custard or junket. During the next few days, chicken (white\\r\\nmeat), scraped beef or mutton in small quantities, baked potato, rice and\\r\\ncereals may be given and by the end of the week a gradual return to the\\r\\nordinary diet may be made. Should there be any tendency to constipation,\\r\\nthe bowels should be opened by a simple enema (as before stated) or\\r\\nglycerin enema, etc.; or by one or more doses, 2 drams, of the compound\\r\\nlicorice powder repeated in three or four hours, if necessary; or a half\\r\\nounce of castor oil, or a half glass of hunyadi water. Cooked fruits for\\r\\nthe constipation may also be given.\\r\\n\\r\\nBleeding After Delivery, Post-Partum Hemorrhage.--Bleeding from the womb\\r\\noccurring six hours after delivery is called post partum and after that\\r\\ntime, is known as puerperal child-birth bleeding or hemorrhage.\\r\\n\\r\\nCauses.--A relaxed condition of the womb, the retention of clots or parts\\r\\nof the membranes, etc., in the womb, a full rectum or bladder, fibroid\\r\\ntumors, deep tears of the cervix.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--If the bleeding is profuse, the pulse is fast, the woman looks\\r\\npale, anxious and feels cold, restless, gaping, usually it comes from a\\r\\nrelaxed, softened and enlarged womb.\\r\\n\\r\\n[OBSTETRICS OR MIDWIFERY 541]\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--In severe forms no time must be lost in securing contraction\\r\\nof the womb and the method employed for expelling the after-birth should\\r\\nbe employed to expel clots. Grasp the womb over the abdomen, employ firm\\r\\nbut gentle kneading, pressing downward. The pillows should be removed, the\\r\\nfoot of the bed elevated twelve to eighteen inches, a preparation of ergot\\r\\ngiven by the mouth or hypodermically in the thigh. If these measures fail\\r\\nthe hand and arm should be sterilized and inserted in the womb, all clots,\\r\\netc., removed and pressure made over the abdomen on the womb while the\\r\\nhand is still there. This pressure and presence of the hand close the\\r\\nbleeding vessels in the womb. The hand should remain, while the kneading\\r\\ngoes on externally, on the womb.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis kneading should be kept up until the womb contracts. The hand can\\r\\nthen be removed from the vagina, while gentle kneading is slowly kept up\\r\\nover the womb. The womb should be closely watched for hours after.\\r\\nBleeding very seldom occurs again, but it might. If the bleeding is more\\r\\nof an oozing, an injection of very hot water, 120 degrees F., through a\\r\\nlong douche nozzle, directly into the womb cavity may be given. This is\\r\\nvery effective for any kind of bleeding. Lemon juice or boiled vinegar can\\r\\nbe added to the injection. Everything used must be perfectly clean or\\r\\nchild-bed fever may be caused by these measures. After the womb has\\r\\nthoroughly contracted, it is sometimes of benefit to place a rubber bag\\r\\nfilled with cold water over the pubic bone to prevent subsequent\\r\\nrelaxations of the womb. Weakness can be met by hypodermics of whisky or\\r\\nbrandy and strychnine, one-thirtieth of grain, injected hypodermically to\\r\\nstimulate the heart.\\r\\n\\r\\nPulse and Temperature.--The temperature may rise one to one and one-half\\r\\ndegrees without the case being abnormal. The pulse falls after labor,\\r\\nranging between sixty and seventy. A rise of temperature, a rapid pulse, a\\r\\nflushed face, a chill, pain or tenderness of the abdomen, and abnormal\\r\\nincrease or decrease of the discharge, bleeding, or offensive odor of the\\r\\ndischarge should cause suspicion of child-bed (puerperal) fever. This is a\\r\\ngrave condition and results from infection which has taken place during\\r\\nlabor or afterward. The septic matter may be carried in on the fingers or\\r\\ninstruments by the physician or attendants, etc. The most usual sources\\r\\nare unclean hands, instruments and clothing which come in contact with the\\r\\nwoman\\'s genitals. The attack is usually ushered in during the second to\\r\\nthe fourth day by a chill, or chilly sensations, etc., rise of\\r\\ntemperature, rapid pulse, accompanied by headache and a feeling of\\r\\nweariness. The discharge may be increased at first, but later diminished\\r\\nand may cease; or it may be abundant, frothy and of a very fetid odor.\\r\\nSecretion of milk may fail, the bowels are usually constipated, pain in\\r\\nthe abdomen develops.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--If the interior of the womb is smooth, a single antiseptic\\r\\nwomb injection should be given; if it contains foreign material or is\\r\\nrough, it should be scraped and then a douche given. This must be done\\r\\ncarefully and with absolute cleanness. Turpentine stupes should be placed\\r\\nhot on the abdomen for the pain, or where cold feels more grateful the ice\\r\\nbag or cloths wrung out of cold or ice water should be applied over the\\r\\nabdomen, and covered with several thicknesses of flannel and changed as\\r\\nsoon as they become heated. Medicines to relieve the pain may be given.\\r\\nHot and cold sponging may be given to reduce the temperature, a little\\r\\nalcohol can be added to the water or the cold or hot pack may be used.\\r\\n\\r\\n[542 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nDiet.--This should be nourishing and supporting, and at first, liquid and\\r\\nconsist largely of milk; but concentrated broths, jellies, and liquid\\r\\nbeef, peptonoids, are useful. Stimulants should be given in these septic\\r\\nconditions. From one to two ounces of whisky may be given every three to\\r\\nfour hours in the form of milk punch and, if possible, as much red or port\\r\\nwine also. Women in this condition can stand this treatment. Salines\\r\\n(salts) should be given to keep open the bowels.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCONVULSIONS. (Eclampsia).--All forms of convulsions may occur during\\r\\npregnancy. They may occur during pregnancy and during labor. These are\\r\\nusually the result of kidney trouble. The attacks occur most often during\\r\\nthe last three months of pregnancy. Their frequency is one to three\\r\\nhundred to one to five hundred cases. It occurs oftener in the first\\r\\npregnancy, three to one.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--Inhalation of chloroform to control the convulsion. Morphine\\r\\nin one-half grain dose can be given if no chloroform is handy. Place the\\r\\npatient in a hot water or vapor bath, or wrap blankets wrung out of hot\\r\\nwater around her, and pile the bedding on until a profuse sweat is\\r\\nstarted. The sweating aids in eliminating the poison. Change the hot wet\\r\\nblankets as often as necessary. If the convulsions do not cease the womb\\r\\nmust be emptied of its contents. If the convulsions occur during labor\\r\\nthey should be treated in the same manner. The mortality then is about\\r\\nseven per cent. Chloral hydrate in thirty to sixty grain doses in three\\r\\nounces of water may be injected into the rectum if the other remedies\\r\\nfail.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMILK LEG.--This is due to infection. It usually arises from an extension\\r\\nof a blood clot (thrombosis) of the womb or pelvic veins, to the thigh\\r\\n(femoral) vein, resulting in a partial or complete obstruction of the\\r\\nvein. It may come in less frequent cases, from a lymphatic infection.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--They may develop at any time between the tenth and thirtieth\\r\\ndays or even later. These are general feelings of weariness, stiffness and\\r\\nsoreness of the leg, especially when it is moved. There may first be pain\\r\\nin the region of the groin; or pain from the ankle to the groin and\\r\\nfollowed by swelling. The skin of the leg becomes markedly swollen, white\\r\\nand shiny. Later there is pitting on pressure, but not at first, because\\r\\nthe skin is extremely stretched. Fever may accompany the attack, but it\\r\\nwill subside long before the swelling of the leg has disappeared.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe vein may be felt as a hard lash-like cord, a red line of inflammation\\r\\nmarking its course along the inner and under side of the thigh. The\\r\\ndisease may last weeks, depending upon the severity of the trouble. The\\r\\naffected leg is disabled for a number of months after recovery. Recovery\\r\\ntakes place as a rule. Absorption of the clot takes place, or the vessel\\r\\nremains closed, and another (compensatory) circulation is established.\\r\\n\\r\\n[OBSTETRICS OR MIDWIFERY 543]\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--The patient should lie in bed with the leg elevated and\\r\\nswathed in flannel or cotton wet with some quieting lotion. The following\\r\\nis a good lotion:--\\r\\n\\r\\n    Compound Soap Liniment       6 ounces\\r\\n    Laudanum                 1-1/2 ounces\\r\\n    Tincture Aconite Root      1/2 ounce\\r\\n    Tincture Belladonna        1/2 ounce\\r\\n\\r\\nWet the flannel or cotton with this. After the acute symptoms have passed\\r\\nthe following ointment may be put on the leg:--\\r\\n\\r\\n    Ichthyol               45 grains\\r\\n    Iodide of Lead         45 grains\\r\\n    Chloride of Ammonium   10 grains\\r\\n    Alboline                1 ounce\\r\\n\\r\\nThe parts should not be rubbed lest a clot be loosened and travel in the\\r\\ngeneral circulation and thus endanger life.\\r\\n\\r\\nDiet.--Should be supporting. Salts for the bowels.\\r\\n\\r\\n[544 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nALL ABOUT BABY\\r\\n\\r\\nQUESTIONS AND ANSWERS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPreparation, Outfit, Nursing, Formulas for Preparation of Milk\\r\\nfor Bottle-Fed Infants; Weaning, Teething, Diet Through\\r\\nChildhood, All the Baby Diseases, etc., from the Best Medical\\r\\nAuthority, Infant Hospitals and Nurses.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHow long does pregnancy usually last? Two hundred and eighty days.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow can the time be reckoned? Count back three months from the first day\\r\\nof the last menstruation and add seven days to the date thus obtained. To\\r\\nbe more accurate, you should add only six days in the months of April and\\r\\nSeptember, five days in December and January, and in February four days.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat time of pregnancy does the form begin to change? It changes a little\\r\\nthe first two months. It is flatter and lower down. After the third month\\r\\nthere is a progressive enlargement.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat is quickening, and when first felt? It is a motion, of the foetus\\r\\n(child) in the womb, imparted to the abdominal walls, and is felt from the\\r\\nsixteenth to the twentieth week. It has been said to have occurred earlier\\r\\nin some cases.\\r\\n\\r\\nCan you foretell twin pregnancy? Not to a certainty.\\r\\n\\r\\nCan a mother influence her child as to character and temperament before\\r\\nbirth? Authorities differ very much upon this point. The child inherits\\r\\nthe physical characteristics of its parents. The frame of the mother\\'s\\r\\nmind, some think, can be given in some degree to her offspring.\\r\\n\\r\\nWill nervousness be inherited by the child? Not invariably; if the mother\\r\\nis fretful, irritable, cross, repining, etc., her child may be puny, cross\\r\\nand irritable, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\n[ALL ABOUT BABY 545]\\r\\n\\r\\nDo you believe in influences transmitted before birth (parental\\r\\ninfluences?) All must admit that there is a great deal in heredity, and\\r\\nthe characteristics of parents are shown in their children.\\r\\n\\r\\nCan a mother mark her baby? This is another disputed question.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen should the family physician be informed of the woman\\'s condition? The\\r\\nfirst month.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy? So that the woman will know how to live properly, and also that he\\r\\nwill be given the urine twice each month to examine. This is for her\\r\\nprotection and is necessary, because anything that may be wrong with the\\r\\nkidneys can be corrected much easier, and diet, etc. can be arranged to\\r\\nprevent future trouble.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat kind of diet should a pregnant woman have? She should eat only\\r\\nhealthy articles of food. Stimulating, highly seasoned, rich, greasy foods\\r\\nshould be avoided. Constipation is frequently present and the diet must be\\r\\nchosen with reference to that also. She should not restrict herself to one\\r\\nline of diet unless it is necessary.\\r\\n\\r\\nShould she take a daily bath, if so, what kind and when? Yes, if it does\\r\\nher good. The pores of the skin should be kept open so that the kidneys\\r\\nwill have less work to do. Spray and baths should be taken cold or\\r\\nlukewarm. Hot baths or Turkish baths are to be avoided. The time should be\\r\\nat the woman\\'s convenience. Morning is preferable, if she does not feel\\r\\nthe need of sleep.\\r\\n\\r\\nShould she take a daily nap and when? Yes, one or two hours in the\\r\\nforenoon, and also in the afternoon.\\r\\n\\r\\nShould she take exercise? Yes, exercise is necessary. This promotes the\\r\\nproper circulation of the blood, favors rest and sleep, relieves the\\r\\n\"blues,\" tones the whole system, gives her good wholesome air and makes\\r\\neverything look better. It should not be violent. Slow walking and riding\\r\\nin an easy carriage. She should not ride a horse, run, jump, dance, or do\\r\\nany jerky or violent exercise; no heavy lifting or reaching up.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat about clothing? The clothing should be perfectly loose and\\r\\ncomfortable. Garters and corsets are injurious, especially when the\\r\\npregnancy has reached four or five months. The weight of the clothing\\r\\nshould be borne by the shoulders instead of the hips. Special waists can\\r\\nbe made for pregnant women. There should be no pressure on any part,\\r\\nespecially on the womb and breasts.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat is the meaning of the word enciente? The Roman women were accustomed\\r\\nto wear a tight girdle about their waists which was called a cincture.\\r\\nThis they removed when they were pregnant. They were then said to be\\r\\nincincta, or unbound. The term enciente is derived from this, and is\\r\\nfrequently used to indicate pregnancy.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat are the main symptoms of miscarriage? Pain and bleeding.\\r\\n\\r\\n[546 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nDoes it usually come on suddenly? Not as a rule. There are premonitory\\r\\nsymptoms such as bearing down feeling in the pelvis, backache, frequent\\r\\ndesire to pass water, a discharge from the vagina, and sometimes a little\\r\\nbloody flow.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt what period is it most common? Between the ninth and sixteenth weeks\\r\\nwhen the after-birth is forming.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat are the causes of miscarriage? Diseases of the womb, disease in the\\r\\nfather, constipation, falls, over-exertion, violent emotions, such as\\r\\nshock, fright, anger, blows on the abdomen, over-lifting, reaching up,\\r\\nsewing on machine.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat is the first thing to do? Lie down, rest and send for a doctor.\\r\\n\\r\\nIs it ever possible to stop it? Yes, and often.\\r\\n\\r\\nDo the breasts need any special care? The nipple, if much drawn in and\\r\\nsmall, should be \"pulled out\" once or twice daily. It will do to rub sweet\\r\\noil on the breasts every evening in order to relieve the tightness and\\r\\ndiscomfort, especially after the pregnancy has advanced some months.\\r\\n\\r\\nAre there any diseases to which a pregnant woman is more subject? None. The\\r\\nkidneys need more watching.\\r\\n\\r\\nCan any dentistry be done during pregnancy? Not if it makes her very\\r\\nnervous; but toothache can cause more harm from a diseased tooth than if\\r\\nit were treated carefully.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy do pregnant women suffer from \"varicose\" veins? The enlarged womb\\r\\npresses upon the veins and thus obstructs the return flow of the blood. It\\r\\nis not so common during the first pregnancy.\\r\\n\\r\\nCan anything be done for this trouble? The woman should lie down a good\\r\\npart of the time if possible, and also wear a perfectly fitting elastic\\r\\nstocking. They can be had of any size and length. The limb should be\\r\\nmeasured for them.\\r\\n\\r\\nDoes oiling and massaging the body do good? Some women claim it does; it\\r\\ncertainly puts the muscles in better condition and strengthens the muscles\\r\\nof the abdomen which have so much part in the labor.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat is the morning sickness and are all women subject to it? Nausea and\\r\\nvomiting without any cause. No; many escape it entirely.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt what period of pregnancy does it usually occur? During the early months\\r\\nit is more frequent and troublesome.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow long does it usually last? Usually three or four months, but it may\\r\\nlast during the whole pregnancy.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat can be done for it? In some cases arranging the diet to prevent and\\r\\ncure constipation relieves it. For fuller treatment see this heading under\\r\\nObstetrics.\\r\\n\\r\\nDoes it ever endanger life? Not often, but a physician should be called if\\r\\nit is bad.\\r\\n\\r\\n[ALL ABOUT BABY 547]\\r\\n\\r\\nCan any strict rules be laid down for this trouble? No, but the food\\r\\nshould be as concentrated as possible; egg-nog, ice cream, a bit of rare\\r\\nsteak, etc., raw oysters, gruels, meat broths, etc., if liquids are well\\r\\nborne. It is surprising how little will keep up some women during\\r\\npregnancy.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen and how often should the urine be examined? From the beginning and\\r\\ntwice each month, and every week after the fifth month.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen should the nurse be called? Long enough before the expected time to\\r\\nget everything ready.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat is lightening? It is caused by the womb sinking down lower in the\\r\\npelvis the last month, and this lightens the pressure upon the diaphragm\\r\\nand lungs.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat are false pains? They occur during the last few weeks of pregnancy at\\r\\nirregular intervals and are usually in the abdomen.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat is the bag of waters? It is a sac containing the fluid in which the\\r\\nchild floats while in the womb. The amount of fluid varies from a pint to\\r\\na gallon or more. When it ruptures there is a sudden flow of liquid, more\\r\\nor less continuous flow. It may occur at the very beginning of labor and\\r\\nis one of the signs of labor.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat are the other signs of approaching labor? A profuse discharge of\\r\\nmucus from the vagina, and this may be tinged with blood. The \"show\" pains\\r\\nbegin generally in the back and are quite regular, one every twenty\\r\\nminutes or half hour. (Dilatation of the womb).\\r\\n\\r\\nHow should the baby be first washed? See Obstetrics.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat clothing should be put on? See Obstetrics chapter.\\r\\n\\r\\nCare of the eyes.--Wipe the eyelids with clean gauze and water. If there\\r\\nhas been much discharge from the vagina during pregnancy, the child\\'s eyes\\r\\nshould be washed cleanly and also one or two drops of the one per cent\\r\\nsolution of silver nitrate should be put into each eye as a preventive.\\r\\n(See Obstetrics).\\r\\n\\r\\nHow often should the baby\\'s bowels move? Two or three times daily for the\\r\\nfirst week, and then once or twice a day.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat is the appearance of the stool? It is soft, yellow and smooth and\\r\\nshould not contain any lumps.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow about the urine? It should pass from six to ten times a day, and it\\r\\nshould be colorless.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat is the average weight of a healthy baby? Seven to seven and one-half\\r\\npounds.\\r\\n\\r\\nDoes it lose any weight during the first week? Yes, generally a few\\r\\nounces, then it begins to gain at the rate of four to six ounces each\\r\\nweek.\\r\\n\\r\\nShould the newly-born babe have its eyes exposed to the light? The eyes\\r\\nare very sensitive, and the sun or artificial light should not be allowed\\r\\nto shine on them. The first day the baby is deaf, but his hearing develops\\r\\nand becomes very acute so that he is very much disturbed by sudden, sharp\\r\\nnoises.\\r\\n\\r\\n[548  MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat is the \"soft\" spot on a baby\\'s head? This is called the \"fontanelle.\"\\r\\nDo not touch this spot. This closes in time. At six months of age the\\r\\nfontanelle is somewhat larger than it was at birth because the brain\\r\\nexpands faster than the boney matter deposited around the edges in the\\r\\nskull bones. After this another deposit of bone goes on more rapidly than\\r\\nthe growth of the brain substance, and by sixteen or eighteen months the\\r\\nopening should be entirely closed.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen should the baby be given the second tub bath? Not until the cord has\\r\\ndropped off.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow and when should this be given? The room should be warm. The head and\\r\\nface should be washed first and dried; then the body soaped and the infant\\r\\nplaced in the tub with its head and body well supported by the hands. The\\r\\nbath should be given quickly with no special rubbing, drying with a soft\\r\\ntowel. (An hour after feeding).\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat should be the temperature of the bath? One hundred degrees F. for the\\r\\nfirst few weeks, later ninety-eight F. After six months ninety-five F.;\\r\\nduring the second year from eighty-five to ninety degrees F.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat should you use in giving the bath? Soft, clean sponges or smooth\\r\\ncloths. There should be separate pieces for each eye, for the head, face\\r\\nand buttocks.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat are the objections to sponges? They are very apt to become dirty and\\r\\nare hard to keep clean.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen should the daily bath be omitted? In the case of infants who are\\r\\ndelicate and feeble, when the bath seems to harm them; in all forms of\\r\\nacute sickness, unless the bath is directed. In eczema and many other\\r\\nforms of skin diseases a great deal of harm is often done by soap and\\r\\nwater or water baths.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow should a genuine bath be given? If possible the bath should be given\\r\\nin front of an open fire, in a room where the temperature is from seventy\\r\\nto seventy-two F. and the draughts kept off by a large screen. Have\\r\\neverything at hand with which to give the bath. A folding rubber bath-tub\\r\\nis the best, next a papier-mache one; or if tin must be used, put a piece\\r\\nof flannel in the tub to protect the baby from the tin. If necessary place\\r\\nthe tub on a low table, place another low table to the right of the one on\\r\\nwhich the tub sets, and on this table should be the baby\\'s basket\\r\\ncontaining a soft brush, different sizes of pins in a pin-cushion, several\\r\\nthreaded needles, a thimble, squares of soft linen, absorbent cotton,\\r\\nwooden tooth-picks, a powder-box and puff, or a powder-shaker containing\\r\\npure talcum powder, a box of bismuth subnitrate, one of cold cream, a tube\\r\\nof white vaselin, a dish containing castile, ivory, or pure French soap\\r\\nshould be placed by the basket on the table; also a cup containing a\\r\\nsaturated solution of boric acid; two cheese-cloth washcloths, a soft\\r\\ntowel, a thermometer to test the water, several toothpicks on which a\\r\\nlittle absorbent cotton is twisted, and the rolled flannel band. Then a\\r\\nbasin containing warm water, 98 to 100 degrees F., also one with cold\\r\\nwater. The baby-clothes should be hung on a rack close at hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n[ALL ABOUT BABY  549]\\r\\n\\r\\nHow to take care of a sore navel.--If it looks red or has a thin discharge\\r\\ncoming from it, wash it carefully twice a day with saturated solution of\\r\\nboric acid; or if pus is there use a 1-5000 solution of bichloride of\\r\\nmercury. Use for a dusting powder one part of salicylic acid and nineteen\\r\\nparts of starch on it. It needs a physician\\'s attention if it does not\\r\\nsoon heal.\\r\\n\\r\\nDo any physicians advocate a daily bath before the cord drops off? Yes;\\r\\nbut not a full tub bath.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen does the cord drop off? In from five to ten days.\\r\\n\\r\\nDoes soap hurt a baby\\'s skin? Some doctors claim it does.\\r\\n\\r\\nIs it necessary to use a powder after the bath? No, if all moisture is\\r\\nremoved, there is no need of powder. The skin can be kept cleaner and\\r\\nhealthier without it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGENITAL ORGANS.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen is circumcision needed? Usually when the foreskin is very long and\\r\\nvery tight, so that one must use force to push it back, and always if it\\r\\nproduces local irritation.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow should you clean the genitals of a female child? Use good absorbent\\r\\ncotton and warm water, with a solution of boric acid if necessary, about\\r\\ntwo teaspoonfuls to a pint of warm water. This should be done once a day.\\r\\n\\r\\nIs the hood of the clitoris ever too tight? Yes, and it needs to be\\r\\nloosened and kept so, or it will produce irritation and sometimes\\r\\nconvulsions.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow should you wash the genitals of a male child? In infants and children,\\r\\nthis should be attended to daily. The foreskin should be pushed back and\\r\\nthe parts washed with absorbent cotton and water. Tight foreskin and\\r\\nunclean parts induce trouble and bad habits.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTREATMENT FOR SORE EYES.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow should a newly-born baby\\'s eyes be treated? They should be kept clean\\r\\nwith a soft cloth and warm water. Do not use the same piece of cloth for\\r\\nboth eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nShould redness and pus appear in the eye or eyes a few days after birth,\\r\\nwhat should be done? Use a piece of soft linen or absorbent cotton and wet\\r\\nit in a solution of boric acid or salt (one-half teaspoonful to one pint\\r\\nof water, warm) and wash out the eye or eyes, and if pus appears, use a\\r\\nstronger solution of boric acid (ten grains to eight teaspoonfuls of\\r\\nwater.) If the lids stick together grease them with vaselin from a tube\\r\\nand rub in at night. If the sore eyes are severe send for a physician as\\r\\nit may be the beginning of ophthalmia neonatorum.\\r\\n\\r\\n[550 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nMOTHERS\\' REMEDIES.--1.

Use a swab made by twisting some\\r\\nabsorbent cotton upon a toothpick. The folds between the gums and lips and\\r\\ncheeks may be gently and carefully cleaned twice a day unless the mouth is\\r\\nsore.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf a baby cries while nursing, what is the cause? It may have a sore\\r\\nmouth. What is thrush or sprue? Patches looking like little white threads\\r\\nor flakes appear inside the cheeks.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat is the cause of sore mouth? It is usually due to uncleanness and\\r\\ncarelessness. It may come in delicate babies without any special reason.\\r\\nBabies who suck a \"pacifier\" or a rag with sugar in it are very apt to\\r\\nhave the disease. Bottle-fed babies get it because of uncleanness of the\\r\\nnipple and bottle.\\r\\n\\r\\nShould the baby continue to nurse? Yes, but the mother should thoroughly\\r\\ncleanse her nipple with a solution of boric acid after each nursing.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat should be done for it? It should be washed before and after every\\r\\nfeeding with a solution of baking soda or boric acid of the strength of\\r\\none even teaspoonful to twenty-four teaspoonfuls of water, or listerine,\\r\\none teaspoonful to twenty-four teaspoonfuls of warm water, can be used.\\r\\n(This will be treated more fully later under diseases).

It should be\\r\\nremoved as soon as it is wet and placed in a covered pail in the bathroom,\\r\\netc., and washed at the first opportunity. Pure white soap only should be\\r\\nused, and the diapers should be thoroughly rinsed and boiled. Dry them in\\r\\nthe sun and air and never before the nursery fire. They should be warmed\\r\\nbefore they are again used. Unclean, soiled diapers frequently cause\\r\\nchafing.\\r\\n\\r\\nShould a baby cry while passing urine? No; it may be too acid, alkaline,\\r\\ntoo little of it or too concentrated, or have sand in it. Examine the\\r\\ndiapers.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow about bands for the baby? Straight pieces of flannel, twenty-two by\\r\\nfive inches or wider. They may be knitted.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow long should they be worn? The snug bands, flannel or knitted should be\\r\\nworn, not tight, three months; then if one is worn it should be loose. It\\r\\nmay prevent rupture and bowel trouble.\\r\\n\\r\\nDo you approve of rubber diapers as an outside covering? No, because they\\r\\nconfine the dampness cause more sweating of the parts and may thus cause\\r\\nchafing, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow large should a diaper be? A diaper should be twice as long as wide.\\r\\nThey may be different sizes, eighteen by thirty-six inches, twenty-two by\\r\\nforty-four, or twenty-seven by fifty-four.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAFING.\\r\\n\\r\\nChafing is a very common trouble in infants. What causes chafing? A wet\\r\\ndiaper left on too long; not drying the folds of the flesh properly; too\\r\\nmuch and too strong soap in the bath, or in the diapers when they are\\r\\nwashed, or failure to wash the child clean.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhere are the places where baby is most likely to chafe? The buttocks, in\\r\\nthe folds of the neck and in the groins.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow can you prevent chafing? Use very little soap; no strong soap; rinse\\r\\nthe body carefully; dry thoroughly after rinsing; use clean diapers; use\\r\\ndusting powder in the folds of the flesh, especially in fat babies.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the skin is very sensitive, what then? Do not use any soap, but use\\r\\nbran or salt baths.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow can you prepare a bran bath? Place one pint of wheat bran in coarse\\r\\nmuslin or cheese-cloth bag and put this in the bath water. It should then\\r\\nbe squeezed for five minutes until the water looks like porridge.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow is a salt bath prepared? One teaspoonful of common salt to each two\\r\\ngallons of water.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the parts are chafed what should we do? Do not use any soap, and give\\r\\nonly bran or salt baths or use pure olive oil and no water at all on the\\r\\nchafed parts. Dry the parts carefully with old, soft linen and dust them\\r\\nwith a powder made of starch and talcum--equal part--with one-fourth as\\r\\nmuch boric acid, all carefully mixed together. Or use starch two parts and\\r\\nboric acid one part. Pure stearate of zinc powder is also good. Keep a\\r\\nlittle piece of soft linen between the folds of the flesh, so they will\\r\\nnot be irritated by rubbing together.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Portait of Ardis]\\r\\n\\r\\n[ALL ABOUT BABY 553]\\r\\n\\r\\nMOTHERS\\' REMEDY.--1.

This is the most\\r\\ncommon place for chafing, as it is so frequently wet and soiled; hence all\\r\\nnapkins should be renewed as soon as wet and soiled and the parts always\\r\\nkept perfectly clean.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat is prickly heat, and how caused? Fine, red pimples appear, caused by\\r\\nexcessive sweating and from irritation of flannel underwear.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow should I treat it? Muslin or linen should be worn next to the skin.\\r\\nThe entire body sponged frequently with vinegar and water (equal parts)\\r\\nand plenty of starch and boric acid powder used; starch, two parts; boric\\r\\nacid (one part) should be put on.\\r\\n\\r\\n(See Mother\\'s Remedies under \"Prickly Heat,\" General Department.)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCLOTHING FOR THE BABY.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe chest should be well covered with soft flannel, the limbs protected,\\r\\nbut not cramped, the abdomen supported by a band, not too tight. The\\r\\nclothing should be neither too tight nor too loose. No pins should be\\r\\nused, but all bands should be fastened to the body. The petticoats should\\r\\nbe supported by shoulder straps.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow should a baby be held during dressing? It should lie on the lap until\\r\\nquite old enough to sit alone. Draw the clothes over the child\\'s feet and\\r\\ndo not slip them over the head.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy use the band, and how long should it be worn? It protects the abdomen,\\r\\nbut its main use is to support the abdominal walls in very young infants\\r\\nand thus prevents rupture. The snug flannel band should not be worn more\\r\\nthan four months. Then in healthy infants a knitted band may be used and\\r\\nworn up to eighteen months. If the baby is thin and the abdominal organs\\r\\nare not protected by fat, they may be troubled with diarrhea and need\\r\\nprotection. In such condition, the band may be worn until the third year.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBABY\\'S FIRST WARDROBE.\\r\\n\\r\\nFour to six dozen diapers (bird\\'s-eye cotton), two to three shirts (wool),\\r\\nfour flannel skirts, two white skirts (nainsook), two to four night\\r\\ndresses (outing flannel), six day dresses, two wrappers, six pairs of\\r\\nsocks, four to six flannel bands, two flannel sacks, two shawls or\\r\\nafghans.

The thinnest gauze\\r\\nflannel undershirts should be worn, the outside garments to be changed for\\r\\nthe changing weather. They should not be kept too hot in the middle of the\\r\\nday, while in the morning and evening extra wraps should be used.\\r\\n\\r\\nShould older children go with bare legs? There is no objection, if they\\r\\nare strong and well, to doing this in warm weather.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat kind of underwear should be worn in cold weather? Next to the\\r\\nheaviest is thick enough.\\r\\n\\r\\nDo children require heavy flannels? Not as a rule, as they usually live in\\r\\nthe nursery and they sweat readily while playing. When they go\\r\\nout-of-doors, coats and leggings render thick flannels unnecessary.\\r\\n\\r\\nAre many children too thinly clad in the house? Very few. The usual\\r\\nmistake is excessive clothing and too warm rooms. These cause them to take\\r\\ncold so easily.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGENERAL DRESSING FOR DIFFERENT SEASONS.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt night baby may have a warm sponge bath, a fresh band, shirt and skirt\\r\\nput on. In the winter he should sleep in a flannel nightdress and this can\\r\\nbe made with a drawing string or button on the bottom so that he cannot\\r\\nexpose his feet. In the summer he can wear a cotton night-dress and after\\r\\nthe third month the skirt may be left off in very warm weather. By the\\r\\ntime baby has entered his second month he may wear simple little \"Bishop\"\\r\\ndresses instead of his plain slips. At the end of the third month, the\\r\\nflannel band may be discarded, usually, and a ribbed knitted one used. The\\r\\nband should be of wool in the winter, and of silk and wool in the summer.\\r\\nIt should be put over the child\\'s feet when he is being dressed each\\r\\nmorning, and be changed for a fresh one at night, if  possible. If the\\r\\nbaby is healthy he may begin going out in March, if the days are mild and\\r\\nthere are no stormy cold winds. Begin by letting him stay out one-half\\r\\nhour during the warmest part of the day, then one hour, etc. When there is\\r\\nmuch melting snow he should not be taken out. In cold weather the baby\\'s\\r\\ncap and cloak should be lined with flannel or lamb\\'s wool. Woolen mittens\\r\\nshould cover his hands. A veil is not necessary.\\r\\n\\r\\nCap for Baby\\'s Ears.--If baby\\'s ears stand out from his head a\\r\\nconsiderable distance, it can be corrected best when he is young. A\\r\\nskeleton cap is made for this purpose. This can be bought or the mother\\r\\ncan make one out of thin lawn or pieces of broad tape. It should fit\\r\\nsnugly in order to do any good and be worn for some time.\\r\\n\\r\\nDrooling.--If the baby drools much he is apt to wet any little bib he may\\r\\nwear and take cold by having damp clothing next to his throat and chest.\\r\\nCut a piece of material now made (Linite, by Johnson & Johnson) in the\\r\\nshape of a bib, and bind with tape. This can be worn underneath the bib.\\r\\n\\r\\n[ALL ABOUT BABY 555]\\r\\n\\r\\nShort Clothes About the Fifth Month.--Short clothes should be prepared for\\r\\nthe baby\\'s wear at the beginning of the fifth month, and may consist of a\\r\\nshirt, knitted band with shoulder straps, flannel skirt made on a cotton\\r\\nwaist, in summer or a flannel one for cold weather, and having a row of\\r\\nsmall flat buttons, on to which the white petticoat may be buttoned; a\\r\\ndiaper, and a simple white dress. For summer, white cotton stockings\\r\\nshould always be worn, woolen ones in the winter; and they should be long\\r\\nenough so that they may be pinned to the diaper. Moccasins or soft kid\\r\\nshoes should be the first kind worn. At night a baby (in short clothes)\\r\\nshould sleep in a shirt, band, diaper and a night-dress of cotton in\\r\\nsummer, and flannel in winter. The change to short dresses should not be\\r\\nmade in very cold weather; and if the baby is born at such a time as to\\r\\nmake it necessary, he may be put into short clothes as early as the end of\\r\\nhis third or fourth month, rather than to wait until later and make the\\r\\nchange in mid-winter.\\r\\n\\r\\nClothing in Summer.--Even in summer, the baby should have clothing which\\r\\ncontains some wool. A mixture of silk and wool or cotton and wool may be\\r\\nused for the shirt, band and skirt. The band should never be left off; the\\r\\nshirt may be left off in the hottest weather and the long ribbed band with\\r\\nshoulder-straps may take its place, but the abdomen must be covered by\\r\\nmeans of the band. The nightdress should now be of cotton and the skirt\\r\\nleft off at night, but the band and the thin skirt should be worn. Long,\\r\\nwhite cotton stockings reaching to the napkin should be worn all summer,\\r\\nand not short socks.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe head should be kept cool, therefore do not use a sunbonnet which shuts\\r\\nout all of the air. Muslin caps and light pique hats provide enough shade,\\r\\nif the baby-carriage has a parasol.\\r\\n\\r\\nCreeping aprons can be used for babies. They are made of fine gingham and\\r\\nmay be put over the dress or worn without one in very warm weather. Make\\r\\nthem so as to button all the way down the back, and they sometimes have an\\r\\nelastic or draw-string run into the hem at the bottom of the apron so that\\r\\nthe white skirts may be kept clean.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor early fall, two or three little jackets of light flannel or cashmere\\r\\ncan be made; and the baby can wear one of these either over or under his\\r\\nwhite dress in the morning or evening when it is cool. The baby should be\\r\\nin the house by six o\\'clock unless the weather is exceptionally warm. In\\r\\nthe fall, if he has been accustomed to having his nap on the piazza, in\\r\\nhis carriage, a screen should-be placed around the carriage to protect him\\r\\nfrom any possible draught. After the first of October, in chilly days, he\\r\\nshould have his nap in the house.\\r\\n\\r\\n[556 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nWinter.--A year-old baby in winter should wear a medium weight wool shirt,\\r\\nknit band with shoulder-straps, a flannel skirt on a flannel waist, white\\r\\nskirt buttoned on to the waist of the flannel skirt, woolen stockings\\r\\npinned to the diaper, laced shoes, a white dress of some cotton  material\\r\\nand for very cold days, a little flannel, or cashmere sack. At night\\r\\nshould be worn a band, shirt, diaper and flannel night-dress long enough\\r\\nto keep his feet warm. For an outing in the winter he should have on a\\r\\nlight, but warmly lined coat; a wadded lamb\\'s wool lining is best, but it\\r\\nis expensive, and flannel may be used. His bonnet should be lined with\\r\\nflannel; and leggings and mittens should be of wool.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst Half of Second Year.--A baby of this age may wear a thin gauze shirt\\r\\nwith short sleeves, but he should wear under it the ribbed silk and wool\\r\\nband and also his flannel petticoat during the summer. Summer complaint is\\r\\noften kept off by such clothing.\\r\\n\\r\\nSecond Half of Second Year.--A baby of this age is too young to walk in\\r\\nthe streets in the winter, and his feet cannot be protected from the damp\\r\\nand cold sidewalks by the usual roomy shoes. When in the go-cart instead\\r\\nof his carriage, his legs should be well covered, so that dampness and\\r\\nwind will not chill and give him a cold. A large bag having a draw-string\\r\\nat the top is an excellent thing to use for the lower part of baby\\'s body\\r\\nwhile in the go-cart, and the strings should be drawn up and tied under\\r\\nhis arms. This bag may be made of any material (warm) from eiderdown,\\r\\ncloth, flannel to felting; or it may simply be made of an old crib blanket\\r\\nand a small carriage robe placed over it. Baby\\'s ears should be covered at\\r\\nthis age on very cold days, when out. The baby girl should wear a lined\\r\\nbonnet, well covering her eyes. Tam O\\'Shanter caps of angora wool can be\\r\\nmade and pulled down over the eyes for both girls and boys alike; or a\\r\\nsoft felt hat with rosettes of ribbon lined with flannel sewed onto the\\r\\nelastic can be made for the boy to protect the head and ears.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the time baby is two years old, diapers should be given up and little\\r\\ndrawers used instead. It may be frequently necessary to use diapers at\\r\\nnight for several months longer, although if the baby be taken up at ten\\r\\nor eleven o\\'clock p. m. he will frequently go all night without urinating.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst Half of Third Year.--Children of this age should be put into\\r\\nnight-drawers, cotton ones in summer and flannel ones either with or\\r\\nwithout feet, in winter. Tiny overalls or \"rompers\" are now used a good\\r\\ndeal for both boys and girls while at play.\\r\\n\\r\\nSecond Half of Third Year.--Now he can walk in the street for a little\\r\\nwhile each day, even in winter, having his legs protected by warm leggings\\r\\nand with small rubbers for his shoes when the walks are at all damp.\\r\\nWoolen leggings should be used.\\r\\n\\r\\nChildren should not be allowed to race about in their night-drawers and\\r\\nbare feet. They should also have little wrappers and bedroom slippers.\\r\\n\\r\\n[ALL ABOUT BABY 557]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat About the Nursery? The furnishings should be very simple. No\\r\\nunnecessary hangings or upholstered furniture. A large room, well\\r\\nventilated and one in which the sun shines at some part of the day. The\\r\\nshades should be dark, but no extra hangings or curtains. Nothing should\\r\\nbe allowed about the baby\\'s crib but what can be washed. The air should be\\r\\nkept pure. There should be no plumbing, no drying of napkins or clothes,\\r\\nno cooking of food, and no gas burning at night. A small wax candle will\\r\\ndo for all usual purposes.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat kind of heat is best? An open grate fire is best; next, heat from a\\r\\nFranklin stove. Steam heat is bad in a nursery. Never use a gas stove\\r\\nunless for a few minutes during the morning bath.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat should the temperature be during the day? From 66 to 68 degrees with\\r\\nthe thermometer hung three feet above the floor. It should never be\\r\\nallowed above 70 F. At night, not below 65 F. during the first three\\r\\nmonths. After that it may go to 55 F., and after the first year it may go\\r\\nto 50 and even to 45 F.\\r\\n\\r\\nDoes the fireplace furnish enough ventilation? No, the principal\\r\\nventilation must be from the windows.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow soon can you leave the windows open at night? Usually after the third\\r\\nmonth, except when the outside temperature is below the freezing point.\\r\\nHow often should the nursery be aired? At least twice a day, after the\\r\\nbaby has had his bath in the morning and also before putting him to bed\\r\\nfor the night. This ventilation should be done thoroughly and the baby\\r\\nshould be moved to another room. In the meantime, any time the child is\\r\\nout of the room it should be aired.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow can you ventilate the room at night? During the winter, while the baby\\r\\nis young, the sleeping room may be ventilated at night by opening a window\\r\\nin an adjoining room; or if the weather is not very severe, a window board\\r\\nmay be used, or a frame on which has been tacked heavy muslin; this may be\\r\\nfrom one to two feet high and put into the window like an ordinary\\r\\nmosquito screen. In summer, a screen around baby\\'s crib will furnish all\\r\\nneeded protection from the open windows.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow does a room that is kept too warm affect the baby? He becomes pale,\\r\\nloses his appetite, has some indigestion, gains no weight, perspires very\\r\\nmuch and takes cold easily.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow early in baby\\'s life may airing indoors be commenced, and how long\\r\\ncontinued? When the baby is one month old. For fifteen minutes at a time\\r\\nat first and may be lengthened ten to fifteen minutes daily. This airing\\r\\nmay be continued in all kinds of weather.\\r\\n\\r\\nWill the baby take cold? Not if the period is at first short and the baby\\r\\nbecomes accustomed to it gradually. It is a cold preventive.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow should such an airing be given? The baby should be dressed with bonnet\\r\\nand tight coat and placed in a crib or carriage which should stand a few\\r\\nfeet from the window; all the windows should be thrown open for baby\\'s\\r\\nairing. Doors should be closed to prevent draughts.\\r\\n\\r\\n[558 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nHow soon can baby be taken out of doors? In summer when one week old, with\\r\\neyes thoroughly shaded. In spring and fall usually in about one month; in\\r\\nwinter, when about three months old, on pleasant days, and kept in the sun\\r\\nand out of the wind.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat time of day is best? A baby may go out almost any time in the early\\r\\nsummer and early autumn between 6 A. M. and 7 P. M. In winter and early\\r\\nspring a young child only between ten or eleven and three.\\r\\n\\r\\nCan this be done in all kinds of weather? When the winds are sharp and the\\r\\nground covered with melting snow, and when it is very cold, the baby\\r\\nshould not go out. If the thermometer is below 32 degrees F., a child\\r\\nunder four month\\'s should not go out. If below 20 degrees F., a baby under\\r\\neight month\\'s should not go out.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat care should be taken? The wind should never blow in the baby\\'s face,\\r\\nits feet and legs should be properly covered and warm and the sun should\\r\\nnever be allowed to shine directly upon its eyes either sleeping or\\r\\nwaking.\\r\\n\\r\\nDoes this outing do the baby any good? The fresh air renews and purifies\\r\\nthe blood, and this is just as necessary for its health and growth as\\r\\nproper food.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow does it show in the baby? The appetite is good, also the digestion.\\r\\nThe child sleeps better and all signs of health are seen.\\r\\n\\r\\nIs it better for the baby to be carried by the nurse in this airing? No,\\r\\nfor it can be made more comfortable in its carriage and as well protected\\r\\nfrom exposure.\\r\\n\\r\\nIs there any objection to a baby sleeping out of doors in the daytime? No,\\r\\nit needs only to be kept warm and out of draughts. A covered inclosed\\r\\nporch is a good place.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat can be done for a child that takes cold easily? The room should be\\r\\nkept cool when it sleeps, the clothing should be light so that he will not\\r\\nperspire so freely. Every morning the chest and back should be sponged\\r\\nwith cold water, 50 to 60 degrees F.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow should such a sponge bath be given? The child should stand in a tub\\r\\ncontaining a little warm water, and a large bath sponge filled with cold\\r\\nwater should be squeezed over the body two or three times. Follow this\\r\\nwith vigorous rubbing with a towel until the skin shows quite red. This\\r\\nmay be given at least at three years old. For infants the temperature\\r\\nshould be 65 to 70 degrees F.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWEIGHING BABY FREQUENTLY.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy is it necessary to weigh the baby regularly? To be able to tell how it\\r\\nis doing. This is especially necessary during the first year.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow frequently should this be done? During the first six months every\\r\\nweek, and during the last six months at least once in two weeks; once a\\r\\nmonth during the second year.\\r\\n\\r\\n[ALL ABOUT BABY 559]\\r\\n\\r\\nHow rapidly should the baby\\' gain weight during the first year? During the\\r\\nfirst week it loses a few ounces, after this it shows a gain of four to\\r\\neight ounces a week up to the sixth month, then two to four ounces a week,\\r\\nup to the twelfth month.\\r\\n\\r\\nDo bottle-fed infants gain so rapidly? Very seldom during the first month,\\r\\nbut after that with favorable air and circumstances, the gain is quite\\r\\nregular, and they may gain faster during the latter part of the first\\r\\nyear, because the nursing baby loses weight at weaning time.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy do they not gain so rapidly at first? Because it takes a few weeks for\\r\\nthe stomach to become accustomed to cow\\'s milk and until this is\\r\\naccomplished it is necessary that the milk be made very weak or\\r\\nindigestion will result.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat is a baby\\'s average weight at birth? Seven to seven and one-half\\r\\npounds.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow much should it be at different months at this average birth? At three\\r\\nmonths it should be twelve to thirteen pounds; at six months fifteen to\\r\\nsixteen pounds; at nine months seventeen to eighteen pounds; at one year\\r\\ntwenty to twenty-two pounds. A healthy baby will usually double its weight\\r\\nat five months and at twelve months it will nearly triple its weight.\\r\\n\\r\\nShould a healthy baby gain steadily in weight during the first year? He\\r\\nusually does, but not regularly in every week during the year. There are\\r\\nperiods when most infants do not gain any weight. This is most often seen\\r\\nfrom the seventh to the tenth month and frequently occurs when the child\\r\\nis teething and sometimes in the very hot weather.\\r\\n\\r\\nIs gaining regularly in weight a sure sign that the child is thriving\\r\\nnormally? Not always, some infants\\' foods produce weight, but not strength\\r\\nnor development in other respects.\\r\\n\\r\\nCan the regular gaining in weight guide us as much in the second year? The\\r\\ngain after the first year is not so continuous; interruptions occur during\\r\\nchange of seasons, sometimes without any apparent cause.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow soon should a child hold its head up? During the fourth, and sometimes\\r\\nin the third month, as a rule. If the body is supported the head can be\\r\\nheld erect.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow early does a baby notice things? During the second month he shows\\r\\npleasure by smiling and will turn his head in the direction of a sound.\\r\\nThey should be kept quiet, or their sleep will be broken.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat will it do at three months? It will recognize its nurse or mother,\\r\\nand will smile and \"coo\" when she approaches, and now for the first time\\r\\nthe tear glands become active and the baby cries with tears. At this age\\r\\nwhen taken out he should lie out straight in a heavy folded blanket, or\\r\\nhair pillow, having a small thin pillow under his head; a hot water bag\\r\\nshould be near his feet; a light woolen blanket or afghan should be put\\r\\ninto the carriage and the baby placed upon it, then it should be carefully\\r\\nwrapped around him and the outer carriage robe tucked in. These wraps\\r\\nshould be modified according to the weather. Babies should not perspire\\r\\nmuch for they will take cold readily; so the covering should not be too\\r\\nheavy.\\r\\n\\r\\n[560 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen does the baby laugh aloud? From the third to the fifth month.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen does it first notice toys, etc.? From the fifth to the seventh month.\\r\\nAt four months he is able to hold his head without support. He begins to\\r\\nuse his hands better. He will often grasp an attractive object; he will\\r\\nthrow it on the floor and expect it to be picked up for him. And also\\r\\nfrequently shows signs of fear at the end of the fourth month, and\\r\\nstrangers will scare him. He can now be played with for a little time\\r\\nevery day, but never before bedtime. The best time is after the morning\\r\\nnap. Do not toss him about, but be gentle with him or you will make him\\r\\nnervous and sleepless at night.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat is baby\\'s condition at the fifth month? He is now a bright lively\\r\\nfellow, and may sit in a half upright position in his carriage or in his\\r\\nchair for a short time each day. When in his chair he should be tied in, a\\r\\nsoft pad or pillow should be at his back to support him. He now enjoys\\r\\nexercise on a bed or in a large clothes basket, and may even have one toy\\r\\nat a time to play with. Do not shake rattles at him. It tires him. His\\r\\nnaps now grow shorter gradually, but he should take two daily; a long one\\r\\nof two or three hours in the morning and about one hour in the afternoon.\\r\\nHe should not sleep late in the afternoon, or he will not sleep as well at\\r\\nnight. He now \"drools.\" This is a sign of teeth coming, and baby will bite\\r\\nhis fingers and put everything he can hold in his mouth. He may form the\\r\\nsucking habit now, and if he does, put a small toy in his hand, or dip his\\r\\nthumb in a solution of quinine or aloes. The habit of thumb sucking is an\\r\\nugly one. Another way to stop it is to bind a piece of cardboard on the\\r\\narm and long enough to reach a little above or below the elbow. Then the\\r\\narm cannot be bent.\\r\\n\\r\\nShould the baby use an ivory or rubber ring to bite on when teething? A\\r\\nspecial cracker is now made in the form of a ring; it is quite hard and\\r\\ncomposed mostly of malt sugar and is intended for teething babies to bite\\r\\non.\\r\\n\\r\\nMOTHERS\\' REMEDIES.-1. Teething, What One Quebec Mother did for.--\"Rub\\r\\nparegoric on the gums. This always eased my children.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n2.

This cuts the gums and starts bleeding when the baby doesn\\'t\\r\\nthink of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHow early should a baby be able to sit and stand alone? At seven to eight\\r\\nmonths he is usually able to sit erect and support his body. He first\\r\\nattempts to bear the weight upon his feet at nine to ten months, and at\\r\\neleven to twelve months babies can stand without assistance.\\r\\n\\r\\n[ALL ABOUT BABY 561]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen should a child walk without help? At twelve to thirteen months he\\r\\nattempts to walk. At fifteen to sixteen months the average child is able\\r\\nto run alone.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat conditions postpone this? Premature birth, a delicate constitution,\\r\\nor prolonged illness and especially chronic or digestive disturbances.\\r\\nRickets is a common sign of late sitting, standing or walking.\\r\\n\\r\\nShould you urge a child to walk? No; his muscles and bones may not be\\r\\nready. He will walk soon enough if able.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow early does a child begin to talk? Generally a child can say papa and\\r\\nmamma at one year. The end of the second year the average child is able to\\r\\nput words together in short sentences.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf a child does not attempt to talk in two years, what should be\\r\\nsuspected? Child may be a deaf-mute or mentally deficient. It is sometimes\\r\\nseen in children who are very backward.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSPECIAL CARE OF THE BABY.\\r\\n\\r\\nBaby will be sensitive to light, even the first day. Do not allow the sun\\r\\nto shine in his eyes, or gas or electric light if that must be used. The\\r\\nbaby\\'s skin may change to yellow for a few days, but this soon passes away\\r\\nand frequently there is scaling. The fine soft hair usually comes out and\\r\\nis replaced later by a second growth. The open spot on the head should not\\r\\nbe touched. When the head is out of shape or is swollen, this need not\\r\\ncause worry for it will soon disappear. Mold it a little. Do not allow the\\r\\nbaby to lie in one position, as the soft skull may become flattened or all\\r\\nthe hair rubbed off in one place. The baby sleeps about nine-tenths of the\\r\\ntime, but he should be wakened regularly for his food and kept awake while\\r\\ntaking it. This will soon become a regular habit to him, and he will wake\\r\\nof his own accord in a short time. Do not allow the baby to fall asleep\\r\\nnursing at the breast or while taking food in his bottle. He will not get\\r\\nenough nourishment and will want to nurse too often. Also if he is\\r\\nbottle-fed the milk is apt to grow cold and cause colic. He should be\\r\\ntaught to nurse slowly and if he tries to nurse too fast the breast or\\r\\nnipple should be taken away for a minute, and then given again. The baby\\r\\nshould nurse from fifteen to twenty minutes. A certain amount of crying is\\r\\nnecessary for a baby if he is to be strong and healthy. It exercises his\\r\\nlungs. \"Soothing syrup\" should never be given to quiet him.\\r\\n\\r\\n[562 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE CRY-HOW TO DISTINGUISH IT.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cry of pain is strong, sharp, but not continuous, often accompanied by\\r\\ncontractions of the features and drawing up of the legs. The cry of hunger\\r\\nis a continuous, fretful sound, after feeding or sometime before the next\\r\\nfeeding. The cry of temper is loud and strong, accompanied by kicking or\\r\\nstiffening of the body, and, this should never be given away to from the\\r\\nfirst. The cry of a sick child is feeble and whining. Baby should not be\\r\\nrocked to sleep, nor carried about the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nBaby\\'s First Meal.--He should be placed to the breast as soon as the\\r\\nmother can have him. He will not get much milk for the first few days, but\\r\\nhe should be given the breast four or five times daily. He needs what is\\r\\nthen secreted and it is also good for the mother to try to nurse as soon\\r\\nas possible. The baby may be given a few teaspoonfuls of boiled water\\r\\nbetween nursing, but no teas. At the third day the milk is usually\\r\\nestablished, and the baby should nurse regularly every two hours up to 10\\r\\np. m., and twice at night. He should not sleep in his mother\\'s bed, but\\r\\nhave his own crib and be taken to her at nursing time. There is danger of\\r\\nbaby being smothered sleeping with its mother, and it will not sleep so\\r\\nwell. As a rule it is best to wash baby\\'s mouth out before nursing, and\\r\\nthe mother\\'s nipple should also be wiped off with a little boric acid\\r\\nsolution.\\r\\n\\r\\nBaby\\'s Bed.--As before stated, baby should sleep in his own crib, an iron\\r\\nor brass crib without rockers is best. A screen or plain white curtain of\\r\\nsome wash material may be used to protect him against draughts. If this\\r\\ncannot be had, he may sleep while very young in a large clothes basket\\r\\nplaced on two chairs. The crib should have a good woven wire mattress and\\r\\na pair of heavy airing blankets should be placed on top of the crib,\\r\\nfolded so as to fit the mattress; a square of rubber or any waterproof\\r\\nmaterial should come next, then a cotton sheet, a quilted pad, a second\\r\\nsheet, a pair of wool crib blankets and a light counterpane. This should\\r\\nbe removed at night and a comfortable afghan be used in its place. The\\r\\npillow should be of hair, never of feathers or down, about one inch thick.\\r\\nThe bed clothes should be aired thoroughly and the heavy airing blanket be\\r\\nwashed occasionally and thoroughly dried and aired before it is again\\r\\nused. The blanket can hang on a line out of doors on a bright sunny day\\r\\nfor an hour or two; in this way the blanket will be kept cleaner and will\\r\\nlast comfortably until baby is three years old. The baby should never be\\r\\nput in a cold bed; warm the sheets before the fire just before putting\\r\\nbaby in his bed (or crib) or place a hot water bag between them until they\\r\\nare warm. Now (second month) the baby is old enough to use his chair, not\\r\\nto soil his napkin. Place a small chamber on the mother\\'s lap and hold the\\r\\nchild on it, supporting his head and back. Do this exactly the same hours\\r\\nevery day, morning and afternoon, directly after a meal. This training\\r\\nshould be continued, as the position alone often goes a great way in\\r\\nhelping to over-come constipation or any tendency to irregularity of the\\r\\nbowels that may exist. They cannot be taught not to wet the napkin until\\r\\nthey are some months older.\\r\\n\\r\\n[ALL ABOUT BABY 563]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe baby needs water as much as any adult person. Boil a fresh supply\\r\\ndaily and cool and keep it in a covered dish or bottle. A little,--four to\\r\\neight teaspoonfuls,--should be offered to the baby between each meal. It\\r\\ncan be given from a spoon, a medicine dropper, or taken from a nursing\\r\\nbottle, and either hot or cold. This aids in overcoming constipation and\\r\\nteaches a breast-fed baby to use a nursing bottle, which will be of much\\r\\nbenefit should sudden weaning be necessary.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the second month his meals should be given every two and one-half\\r\\nhours during the day, having eight meals in twenty-four hours of three to\\r\\nfour ounces at each meal. At night he should be fed at ten and two.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeals for the Third Month.--Baby should be regularly nursed or fed every\\r\\nthree hours up to ten p. m. Then have one meal at two or three a. m., and\\r\\nnothing more until seven a. m. If bottle fed he should be given three and\\r\\none-half to four ounces at each feeding.\\r\\n\\r\\nFourth Month.--If the mother is nursing her baby, it is a good plan now to\\r\\nteach him how to use the bottle. Some doctors advise one bottle feeding\\r\\neach day from the start, for, should the mother\\'s milk suddenly fail, or\\r\\nshould she be obliged to stop nursing for any reason, there will be no\\r\\nstruggle, which would be very hard for the baby if it happened in hot\\r\\nweather. Also the gradual accustoming of the digestive organs to the cow\\'s\\r\\nmilk before weaning must be commenced and does away in some degree, at\\r\\nleast, with the danger from indigestion from the cow\\'s milk given\\r\\nregularly.\\r\\n\\r\\nFifth Month.--Night feeding should now be discontinued; he should be\\r\\ntaught to sleep from ten p. m. to seven a. m. There may be a few nights of\\r\\ncrying and a struggle when the night feeding is first stopped, but he will\\r\\nsoon learn to sleep without waking for his meal. He should be fed every\\r\\nthree hours until ten p. m., and if bottle fed he should be given five to\\r\\nsix and one-half ounces at each meal, making six meals in twenty-four\\r\\nhours.\\r\\n\\r\\nSixth Month.--The baby sleeps about two-thirds of the time. He shows signs\\r\\nof increasing intelligence. The baby should now accustom itself to taking\\r\\neither condensed milk or only the best prepared foods once or twice daily.\\r\\nThe mother may become ill or unable to nurse for some reason, or wish to\\r\\ntake a journey, etc., and baby is then prepared for emergencies.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the baby is seven months old he will need more exercise than a\\r\\nclothes basket will afford. An exercise pen should be made.\\r\\n\\r\\nTeeth.--As soon as the teeth come they should be kept clean, otherwise\\r\\nthey will decay, milk is likely to remain in the mouth, turn sour and\\r\\ngradually destroy the enamel of the teeth.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a soft linen cloth or a piece of absorbent cotton dipped in a\\r\\nsolution of boric acid wash out the mouth and teeth, twice a day at least,\\r\\ncarefully. A soft brush may be used later when baby has eight or ten\\r\\nteeth, and a little finely prepared chalk may be put on the brush, if\\r\\nthere are any specks on the teeth. The baby should have three meals in\\r\\ntwenty-four hours of six or seven ounces at each meal, if bottle-fed.\\r\\n\\r\\n[564 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nEighth Month.--Baby should be allowed to creep on the floor a little or in\\r\\nhis pen. It is good exercise and it will benefit him, but he should not be\\r\\nurged to do it. Many mothers give baby potato, etc., at this period; this\\r\\nis bad, as potato is hard to digest on account of having so much starch.\\r\\nBread and cakes are also prohibited; convulsions are often caused by such\\r\\nfood. Milk gruel and broths are enough for the baby and he will thrive\\r\\nusing them. Baby should feed every three hours up to ten p. m., six and\\r\\none-half to seven and one-half ounces at each meal.\\r\\n\\r\\nMosquito Bites.--If baby is bitten by mosquitoes wash the spot off with a\\r\\nlittle camphor water, soda water, or a wet compress of witch-hazel should\\r\\nbe kept on the bite or boracic acid or soda solution. Keep the baby from\\r\\nscratching the part by fixing his hands; scratching will further poison\\r\\nthe part.\\r\\n\\r\\nFlies.--They often carry germs of disease on their legs and wings, and\\r\\nthey frequently light on baby\\'s mouth or on the nipple of the nursing\\r\\nbottle. Diseases can be contracted in this way. The windows should be\\r\\nscreened. Everything that the fly has touched should be washed with some\\r\\nlight antiseptic solution.\\r\\n\\r\\nNinth Month.--His long morning nap should be encouraged and he should\\r\\nsleep in the early afternoon. If the baby is heavy his little moccasin or\\r\\nkid shoes will not now support his ankles and he should have a shoe with a\\r\\npiece of stiffening at the side. The shoe should have no heels; laced\\r\\nshoes fit better and should be preferred. The baby (bottle-fed) can take\\r\\nseven to eight ounces of the proper food every three hours until ten p. m.\\r\\n\\r\\nTenth Month.--He can now take a little beef juice, beginning with one\\r\\nteaspoonful once a day and soon twice a day; then increase to two\\r\\nteaspoonfuls at a time and keep on until he is taking eight teaspoonfuls\\r\\ndaily.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis should be given between his regular meals. Some babies cannot take\\r\\nbeef juice; orange juice may then be tried, strained through cheesecloth\\r\\nor fine muslin and be given at first in doses of one teaspoonful and\\r\\nincreased until baby gets the juice of one-half an orange.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the mother is nursing baby and he has been given one bottle of milk\\r\\ndaily, as advised for a four-months-old babe, he can now have two bottle\\r\\nfeedings daily. Every healthy baby should be weaned when one year old, and\\r\\nit is better to do it gradually in this way. The baby\\'s food should now be\\r\\ngiven him every three and one-half hours up to ten p. m., thus making five\\r\\nmeals in twenty-four hours of seven to eight ounces at each meal.\\r\\n\\r\\n[ALL ABOUT BABY 565]\\r\\n\\r\\nEleventh Month.--Baby can now have added to his diet another cereal like\\r\\nfarina well cooked,--twice as long as the directions advise and it should\\r\\nbe half solid when finished. Begin with one teaspoonful and then try two.\\r\\nThis should be given in addition to his beef juice or orange juice. It\\r\\nshould come between his regular meals, which should now be given at\\r\\nfour-hour intervals. He should take eight or nine ounces to a meal.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwelfth Month.--Baby should go to bed at six p. m., and take long morning\\r\\nnap. He should have five meals a day of such food as directed later.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nINFANTS\\' FEEDING.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat is the best food for an infant? Mothers\\' milk.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat is the composition of mothers\\' milk? About thirteen parts solids and\\r\\neighty-seven parts water.\\r\\n\\r\\nName the solids? Fat, sugar, proteids and salts.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat is sugar? Milk sugar or \"lactose.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat are the proteids? The curd of the milk, which is very similar to the\\r\\nwhite of an egg, and is the muscle making element in the milk.\\r\\n\\r\\nIs it necessary to have all these elements? Yes.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat benefit is the fat? It is needed for the growth of the bones, nerves,\\r\\nfat of the body and also for producing heat.\\r\\n\\r\\nGive the use of sugar? It is needed to produce heat and make fat in the\\r\\nbody.\\r\\n\\r\\nUse of the proteids? They are needed for the growth of the cells of the\\r\\nbody, such as those of the blood, the various organs of the muscles.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat do the salts do? Help in the growth of bone.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat is the use of water? Water keeps the food minutely subdivided or in\\r\\nsolution, so that the infant\\'s delicate organs can digest it. It also\\r\\nenables the body to get rid of the waste material.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNURSING.\\r\\n\\r\\nShould all mothers make an attempt at nursing their babies?  Yes, as a\\r\\nrule.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat are the most important conditions that may prevent nursing?\\r\\nTuberculosis now or in the past or, in fact, any other serious chronic\\r\\ndiseases; very delicate health herself. Some acute disease like typhoid\\r\\nfever or cancer.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow soon after labor should the baby be put to the breast? As soon as the\\r\\nmother is able to have it.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat is the food called that it then obtains? Colostrum.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat does this do? It aids in cleaning the baby\\'s system.\\r\\n\\r\\nShould the mother nurse the baby inclining or lying? Yes.\\r\\n\\r\\nDoes nursing drain the mother? Not if she is reasonably well. It is a\\r\\nnatural process.\\r\\n\\r\\n[566 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the mother cannot nurse immediately after labor, what should you feed\\r\\nbaby? The baby will not starve in a few days. Give it warm water regularly\\r\\nevery few hours, or a little cream and warm water.\\r\\n\\r\\nAre there any impediments to nursing? Sometimes the baby is tongue-tied.\\r\\n\\r\\nIs the baby ever too weak to nurse? Yes.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat should be done in that case? Draw the milk from the breast and feed\\r\\nit through a free flowing nursing bottle. Such babies are generally born\\r\\nprematurely.\\r\\n\\r\\nAre the mother\\'s nipples ever at fault? Yes, they are; poorly developed,\\r\\nretracted, that the baby\\'s tongue cannot surround it to draw upon it.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat can be done for them? They should be drawn out, and sometimes a breast\\r\\npump is needed for this.\\r\\n\\r\\nShould the nipples be treated after nursing? They should be dried and\\r\\nclean clothing put against them. Some recommend washing them with a mild\\r\\nsolution of boric acid.\\r\\n\\r\\nAre they ever so tender that nursing is painful? Yes.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat can be done for this? The nipples should be drawn out before\\r\\nconfinement; if neglected use the following: Compound tincture of benzoin\\r\\none-half ounce. After each nursing wash them clean with warm water or\\r\\nwater and a little alcohol and after drying them, put on the tincture of\\r\\nbenzoin with a camel\\'s hair brush. It will not hurt the baby.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat can be done with cracked nipples? Apply benzoin as before directed,\\r\\nand use a glass or rubber nipple shield until it gets well.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow can caked breasts be prevented? The breasts should be kept emptied and\\r\\nwell protected, both while nursing and during the intervals. Empty with a\\r\\nbreast pump if necessary.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf mother\\'s clothes are wet by the excess milk, what can she do? Use a\\r\\nbreast-pump and drink and eat less fluid; eat more solid.\\r\\n\\r\\nShould a baby nurse at both breasts? It is better.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the breast contains pus, what can be done? Nurse at the other breast,\\r\\nbut if both breasts are affected it must stop breast nursing.\\r\\n\\r\\nShould an infant nurse from a mother who is taking medicine? Not as a\\r\\nrule.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen will the mother be able to nurse again? It is hard to tell. If the\\r\\nchild is six months old the child should be weaned if the mother is\\r\\nseriously ill, and children with delicate stomachs should always be\\r\\nweaned, when the mother is sick.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the mother has not enough nurse, what can be done?--Nurse partly and\\r\\nfeed it the rest.\\r\\n\\r\\nCan the milk secretion be increased? Yes, by regulating the mother\\'s diet.\\r\\nShe should drink freely of good cow\\'s milk and have an occasional bowl of\\r\\ngruel, soup, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\n[ALL ABOUT BABY 567]\\r\\n\\r\\nHow long can you wait to see if the mother can have milk? It is well to\\r\\nwait several days, nurse all there is and supply the deficiency by bottle\\r\\nfeeding.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow often should the baby nurse at first, and how long? Every four or five\\r\\nhours for the first few days--usually nurses fifteen to twenty minutes;\\r\\none night nursing.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen is there a full secretion of milk? Usually on the third day.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow often should the baby be nursed afterward? After the third day every\\r\\ntwo hours and twice at night.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow often during the rest of the year? For two to three months every two\\r\\nto two and one-half hours during the day, two times at night; three to\\r\\nfive months about every three hours up to ten p. m.; and one time at\\r\\nnight; five to twelve months every three to three and one-half or four\\r\\nhours and not at night.\\r\\n\\r\\nIs it necessary as a rule to give additional food the first few days? No;\\r\\ngive plenty of water.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat important things should be attended to in nursing? First, a regular\\r\\ntime night and day. Second, nipples should be kept clean.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat should a nursing mother eat? Her diet should be simple and plentiful,\\r\\nand lots of fluids; she should have three regular meals a day, and gruel,\\r\\ncocoa, or milk at bedtime and sometimes between meals. She can use\\r\\ncereals, most soups, most vegetables; avoid sour tart fruits, salads,\\r\\npastry, and desserts. She may eat egg, meats once or twice daily, but in\\r\\nmost cases but once. Tea and coffee if taken should be very weak, and\\r\\nordinarily no wine or beer.\\r\\n\\r\\nAre fruits eaten by the mother likely to injure baby? Sour fruits do in\\r\\nsome cases, but sweet fruits and most fruits that are cooked do not, and\\r\\nare useful for the bowels.\\r\\n\\r\\nShould the mother take special care of herself? Yes, she should lead a\\r\\nsimple, natural, happy life, with outdoor exercise, as soon as possible\\r\\nafter the confinement. She should make her bowels move daily by food and\\r\\nhabit; she should not worry, should sleep plenty and should nap for an\\r\\nhour during the middle of the day.\\r\\n\\r\\nWill the milk of the mother be affected by nervousness? Yes, more so than\\r\\nby her diet; worry, anxiety, fatigue, loss of sleep, household duties,\\r\\nsociety functions, have an injurious effect upon the child. Mother\\'s\\r\\ngrief, excitement, anger, passion, act upon the child through the milk.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow does the return of the menstruation affect the milk? The quantity is\\r\\nlessened, the infant is not satisfied. Sometimes the quality is affected\\r\\nand the child may suffer from restlessness, colic, and acute indigestion.\\r\\n\\r\\nShould regular menstruation prohibit nursing? Not always; as a rule both\\r\\nfunctions do not go together. If the child thrives, it can keep on\\r\\nnursing, although it might be well to feed the infant, at least partly,\\r\\nduring the period.\\r\\n\\r\\n[568 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nHow can you determine that the baby is well nourished? Good color, sleep\\r\\nfor two hours after nursing, is quiet, good-natured and comfortable when\\r\\nawake; has normal bowel movements, three stools daily and gains gradually\\r\\nin weight.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow can you tell when a baby is poorly nourished? It neither gains nor\\r\\nloses weight; it is listless, tired, indifferent, cross, fretful,\\r\\nirritable and sleeps poorly. It looks pale, anemic, and it becomes soft\\r\\nand flabby. If the milk is scanty, it nurses long; at other times it tries\\r\\nthe breast and turns away seemingly disgusted.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat should be done? This depends upon the conditions; should the child\\r\\ngain nothing for three or four weeks or lose weight, immediate weaning may\\r\\nbe necessary; at least other food must be given in addition to the breast\\r\\nfood. Feeding may be alternated with the breast nursing.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow do the symptoms show when the mother\\'s milk disagrees? The child, is\\r\\nin constant discomfort; it sleeps little, is restless, cries much, gulps\\r\\nup gas, passes it by the bowels, or it accumulates in the bowels causing\\r\\ncolic. There may be vomiting, but more often bowel trouble. The bowels may\\r\\nbe constipated but usually there is diarrhea--frequent, loose, green,\\r\\nwith mucus and gas.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat should you do in such a case? If the child does not gain or loses\\r\\nweight and there is little chance of improvement in the mother\\'s milk, the\\r\\nchild should be weaned immediately. If the child gains in weight, try a\\r\\nlittle longer to improve the mother\\'s milk.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy do some babies nurse so often? The milk does not satisfy.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the baby has thrush, should the mother take special care of the\\r\\nbreasts? Yes, they should be cleaned after every nursing.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow much does the baby\\'s stomach hold at birth? Six to seven teaspoonfuls.\\r\\n\\r\\nIs vomiting a healthy sign in infants? Frequent vomiting is not natural;\\r\\nsee if his bands are too tight; find out if he has been danced or handled\\r\\nafter nursing.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen is it harmful? When it is frequent. If it comes up directly after a\\r\\nmeal looking just as it was when taken, the child may be over-fed.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat can be done? Reduce the quantity, or do not let it nurse so long or\\r\\nso often. If vomiting takes place a half hour after feeding, in sour\\r\\nswelling masses, it may be getting food too rich in cream, and then the\\r\\ntime between nursings should be lengthened; or dilute the breast milk by\\r\\ngiving one to two teaspoonfuls of plain boiled water, barley water, five\\r\\nor ten minutes before nursing; the mother should eat less hearty food,\\r\\nespecially of meat.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf baby has frequent colic, what is the cause? The milk has too much\\r\\nproteids.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat should be done? Eat less meat, keep quiet, and happy, do not worry,\\r\\netc.\\r\\n\\r\\n[ALL ABOUT BABY 569]\\r\\n\\r\\nHow many stools does a healthy baby have daily? About two.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat color? Yellow color and pasty consistence.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf a nursing baby has too many stools, what change should be made in the\\r\\nmother\\'s diet? She should eat food that would cause costive bowels in her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLOOSE STOOLS IN NURSING BABIES.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey are caused by the mother eating improper food. If the stools are very\\r\\nyellow, foul, greasy or ropy the mother is eating food that produces too\\r\\nmuch fat (cream) in her milk. If curds appear there is not enough fat, and\\r\\ntoo much of the proteids (skim milk). When the stools are very green with\\r\\nmuch mucus in them, the food should be reduced.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf a nursing baby is constipated, what can be done? More boiled water\\r\\nshould be given between nursing. The mother should take exercise at least\\r\\ntwo hours each day out of doors; her bowels should move every day, even if\\r\\nshe must take a laxative. She should take plenty of pure, rich milk,\\r\\ncocoa, oatmeal and cornmeal gruels, and some kind of tonic if she is weak.\\r\\nTea and coffee should not be used. Ripe fruit (not tart), some green\\r\\nvegetables and a little meat can be eaten. Starchy foods should be\\r\\navoided. Sometimes baby does not get enough nurse. Then she should be fed\\r\\nand given plenty of pure water between meals.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf a nursing baby has frequent colic attacks, what should be done? The\\r\\nfood is probably too strong. The mother should eat food that will produce\\r\\nless fat (cream) in her milk. The baby can be nursed at longer periods for\\r\\na time; or give an ounce of hot water just before nursing. The mother\\r\\nshould take plenty of exercise, enough sleep and have a free movement of\\r\\nher bowels, so as to keep well and free from nervousness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWEANING.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen and how should this be done? This may usually be begun at nine or ten\\r\\nmonths by substituting one feeding a day for one nursing. Later two\\r\\nfeedings, etc., until weaning is gradually accomplished. Some advise one\\r\\nbottle feeding regularly each day much earlier, as before stated.\\r\\n\\r\\nGive reasons for weaning earlier? Some serious illness of the mother,\\r\\npregnancy, but the main reasons usually are that the child is not\\r\\nthriving.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen should the weaning be completed? Generally at one year, It may be\\r\\nadvisable to wait longer in warm, damp weather.\\r\\n\\r\\nIs there any danger in nursing longer? Yes, as the milk is scanty; the\\r\\nchild may get rickets or anemia.\\r\\n\\r\\nIs gradual weaning the best method? Yes.\\r\\n\\r\\n[570 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nShould a wet nurse be preferred to bottle feeding? Yes, if you are sure\\r\\nyou can get a good and perfectly healthy wet nurse. Her habits, etc., must\\r\\nbe unobjectionable--she should be chosen by a physician.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen should a \"weaned\" child use the bottle, and when the cup? If the\\r\\nweaning is done at the eighth or ninth month the bottle should be used; if\\r\\nweaning is done from the tenth to the eleventh month, the baby should be\\r\\ntaught to drink or be fed with a spoon.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow can you overcome some of the difficulties of weaning? As before\\r\\nrecommended, by feeding every nursing infant once a day or by giving water\\r\\nregularly from out a feeding bottle, as this accustoms the baby to the\\r\\nbottle. This is very good, for the mother is sometimes away at nursing\\r\\ntime, for a few hours and the baby can be fed, and when weaning comes, it\\r\\nis much easier.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow soon should a child stop nursing from a bottle? If the child is well\\r\\nthis should be begun at the end of the first year, and after it is\\r\\nfourteen months old, it should not have the bottle except at the night\\r\\nfeeding.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat is the objection to longer bottle nursing? They become attached to\\r\\nthe bottle and refuse solid food when it is proper to give it. They get\\r\\nthe bottle habit; also, it is troublesome and unnecessary. Then they will\\r\\nnot take milk in the future, when the bottle is finally taken from them;\\r\\nan exclusive milk diet for children of two to three years old often\\r\\nresults in poor nutrition and anemia.\\r\\n\\r\\nGive the process of training a child to give up the bottle? There is\\r\\nlittle trouble if it is begun at the right time; pour the milk in a small\\r\\ncup or glass and the child will drink little by little. Give only a small\\r\\nportion of the food in this way, at first, and the balance from the\\r\\nbottle. The child will in a few weeks time learn to drink out of the cup\\r\\nwithout difficulty. If the child is two or three years old, take the\\r\\nbottle away entirely and let the child get hungry, and give it only milk\\r\\nin the cup and nothing else. Some children may go for a day without food,\\r\\nbut hunger will master them finally. As soon as he has learned to drink\\r\\nmilk from his cup, cereals and other solid foods are gradually added to\\r\\nhis dietary and the child has not only been taught to give up his bottle,\\r\\nbut he has also a training which is often necessary.\\r\\n\\r\\nCan you give a baby just weaned as strong cows\\' milk as one of the same\\r\\nage who has been fed upon cows\\' milk from birth? Not generally; it would\\r\\nbe almost certain to cause indigestion. You must remember that the change\\r\\nin food is a great one, and the feeding should be begun with a weak milk\\r\\nand increased gradually in strength as the baby becomes accustomed to the\\r\\ncows\\' milk.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat are the proper proportions for an infant weaned at four or five\\r\\nmonths? About the same as that given to a healthy bottle-fed baby of two\\r\\nmonths, except the quantity should be larger. The food can be gradually\\r\\nincreased, in most cases, so that by the end of two or three weeks the\\r\\nusual strength can be given.\\r\\n\\r\\n[ALL ABOUT BABY 571]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat strength is given to a bottle-fed baby of two months? From the top of\\r\\na quart bottle of pure milk, that has stood from three to six hours, skim\\r\\ncarefully off the top six ounces and then pour off three ounces of milk\\r\\nand mix them with the top milk (first skimmed off) making nine ounces in\\r\\nall; add to this nine ounces twenty-four ounces of boiled water in which\\r\\nyou should have dissolved four teaspoonfuls of granulated sugar, or six or\\r\\nseven teaspoonfuls of milk sugar; add a pinch of salt and a pinch of\\r\\nbicarbonate of soda, or else two ounces of lime water.\\r\\n\\r\\nGive the proper proportion for a baby who is weaned at nine or ten months?\\r\\nAbout the same as for a bottle-fed baby of four or five months.

If\\r\\nthe day is exceedingly warm, pour out one or even two ounces from each\\r\\nbottle of the regular mixture and substitute boiled water for it. If the\\r\\nbaby is inclined to vomit, it will be better during the hot weather to use\\r\\nless of the top milk, four, or five ounces instead of six or eight, and\\r\\nadd so much more gruel. Barley gruel is better than oatmeal gruel unless\\r\\nbaby is constipated. Again if the baby has delicate digestive organs, one\\r\\nmeal each day during the very hot weather, can be made of mutton broth\\r\\nprepared as follows: Cut up one pound of neck of mutton, one pint of cold\\r\\nwater and a pinch of salt; this is cooked very slowly for three hours\\r\\nuntil half a pint is left, adding a little water from time to time as it\\r\\nboils away; strain through muslin and allow to cool, and when cool take\\r\\noff all of the fat.

If the child is not\\r\\nconstipated use barley gruel; if constipated use the oatmeal gruel.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you cannot get the flour, how can you prepare the gruel from the grain?\\r\\nTake two teaspoonfuls of barley or three of oatmeal and allow it to soak\\r\\nover night in cold water; add one quart of cold water the next morning and\\r\\nboil steadily down to a pint, (for about four hours), then strain through\\r\\nmuslin.\\r\\n\\r\\nDo some physicians advise feeding nursing babies one or two meals daily,\\r\\nbeginning the fourth month? Yes.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat strength should it be? Use the formula for bottle-fed babies of the\\r\\nfirst month and the same amounts.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow can you calculate the amount necessary? Take one-eighth or one-fourth\\r\\neither for one or two meals daily of the separate ingredients mentioned in\\r\\nthe formula for the first month.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing order may be as follows: First give baby three ounces of the\\r\\nformula, and if all goes well in a day or two give him three and one-half\\r\\nounces and miss one meal at the breast. After one week if the baby is well\\r\\nsuited, give him three ounces of the formula for the two-months-old baby;\\r\\nwait a few days, then give him four ounces of this formula at the one\\r\\nmeal. Then in a week\\'s time if all goes well, give him four ounces of the\\r\\nformula for the three month\\'s baby. Use this for one week, and then give\\r\\nhim four and one-half ounces of the same formula. If after another week is\\r\\npast, there are no signs of indigestion, give him four ounces of the\\r\\nfour-month formula, and if he enjoys this very much wait for a day or two\\r\\nand then increase the amount to four and one-half ounces of the same\\r\\nformula, and then to five ounces; as he grows older give him of the same\\r\\nformula as the bottle-fed infant of the same age, and the same amount at\\r\\nthe one feeding; if he vomits or has curds in his stools or colic keep him\\r\\non a weak formula longer than formerly advised.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you have fed a breast-fed baby one meal a day from the bottle when can\\r\\nhe be given two feedings from the bottle? During the tenth month.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCOWS\\' MILK.--Does cows\\' milk contain all the elements present in the\\r\\nmother\\'s milk? Yes, but in different proportions.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy not use prepared foods? They are not thought so good, and are more\\r\\nlikely to produce poor nutrition.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat is, the difference between cows\\' milk and mothers\\' milk? Cows\\' milk\\r\\ncontains nearly three times as much casein (curd) or cheesy matter, and\\r\\nonly about one-half as much sugar.\\r\\n\\r\\n[576 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat kind of cows should be selected? They should be healthy and the milk\\r\\nshould be clear and fresh.\\r\\n\\r\\nIs it best to select Jersey cows? The milk from Jersey and Alderney cows\\r\\nis generally too rich; common grade cows are best.\\r\\n\\r\\nShould the milk be from one cow? It should be from the mixed or herd milk\\r\\nsince that varies little from day to day.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow fresh should the milk be? In winter it should not be used after it is\\r\\nforty-eight hours old; in summer not after it is twenty-four hours old,\\r\\nand sometimes it is unsafe in a shorter time.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow should the milk be cared for at the dairies? It must be kept clean and\\r\\nfree from being contaminated. Cows, milkers and stables must all be kept\\r\\nclean, and the milk must be carried in sealed bottles; those that handle\\r\\nthe milk must not be near a contagious disease; all milk pails, bottles,\\r\\ncans, etc., used for the milk must be steamed and boiled before being\\r\\nused.\\r\\n\\r\\nShould it be immediately cooled after leaving the cows? Yes, and kept at a\\r\\ntemperature of about 50 degrees F.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow should the family care for it after it is delivered fresh from the\\r\\ncows? Strain it for infants through a thick layer of absorbent cotton or\\r\\nthrough several thicknesses of cheese-cloth into quart jars or milk\\r\\nbottles, covered and cooled immediately. This is best done by placing the\\r\\nbottles in ice water or cool spring water that comes up to their necks and\\r\\nallow them to remain there at least one-half hour. What you wish to use\\r\\nfor the children who drink plain milk you may pour into one-half pint\\r\\nbottles, and these should be placed in an ice chest or in the coolest\\r\\npossible place. The first rapid cooling is very important and adds greatly\\r\\nto the keeping qualities of the milk, for the milk loses its heat quickly\\r\\nwhen cooled in water, but very slowly when it is simply placed in a cold\\r\\nroom. After standing for four or five hours or longer, the top milk can be\\r\\nstrained off; the cream may be removed after waiting twelve to sixteen\\r\\nhours.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow should it be cared for when received in bottles? The temperature of\\r\\nthe milk is always raised during the delivery, so it should be cooled as\\r\\nbefore described. If it was bottled at a dairy the cream or top milk can\\r\\nbe removed in an hour or two.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow should milk and cream be cared for by the family when purchased in\\r\\nbulk? This milk should never be used for infants, as it is liable to be\\r\\ncontaminated. Both cream and milk should at once be poured into vessels,\\r\\ncovered and kept in a cool place. There will not be much cream or top milk\\r\\nupon such milk.\\r\\n\\r\\n[ALL ABOUT BABY 577]\\r\\n\\r\\nHow should refrigerators be treated? The inner portion should be of metal.\\r\\nAn ordinary metal refrigerator, as sold, if encased in a wooden box makes\\r\\nthe best kind. A covering of felt and heavy quilting can be made for the\\r\\nrefrigerator which can be removed easily when wet or soiled--it must be\\r\\nkept absolutely clean. The compartments for the milk should be so arranged\\r\\nthat the milk bottles be either in contact with the ice or near it. The\\r\\nsupply of ice should always be abundant, or the temperature of the milk\\r\\nwill not be low enough. The temperature should not be higher than 50\\r\\ndegrees F.; it is oftener 60 to 65 degrees F. To tell the temperature, use\\r\\na nursery thermometer and this should be used from time to time to know\\r\\nwhat temperature the milk is in. Milk is often spoiled in too warm\\r\\ntemperatures in refrigerators, and also in unclean refrigerators. Many\\r\\ncases of sickness are caused by it. The refrigerator should carry a\\r\\ntemperature of near 50 degrees F., and be absolutely clean, and the\\r\\ncompartment for the milk should be absolutely separated from other food\\r\\ncompartments.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMODIFIED COWS\\' MILK.\\r\\n\\r\\nCan cows\\' milk be fed to infants without being modified? No; because,\\r\\nalthough the elements are similar to those in mothers\\' milk, they are not\\r\\nidentical, and are present in different proportions.\\r\\n\\r\\nIs this a matter of great moment? Yes, for very few infants can digest\\r\\ncows\\' milk unmodified.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat does modifying cows\\' milk mean? It is changing cows\\' milk so as to\\r\\nmake it more nearly like mothers\\' milk.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat is this changed milk called? Modified milk; and the original milk is\\r\\nknown as \"plain milk,\" \"whole milk,\" \"straight milk\" or \"milk.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nState the principal differences between cows\\' milk and mothers\\' milk?\\r\\nCows\\' milk contains a little more than half as much sugar. It contains\\r\\nnearly three times as much proteids (curds) and salts, and the proteids\\r\\nare different and much harder to digest. The reaction is decidedly acid,\\r\\nwhile the mother\\'s milk is faintly acid or neutral.\\r\\n\\r\\nAny other things of importance to consider? Yes; mothers\\' milk is always\\r\\nfed fresh and sterile, while cows\\' milk is always more or less\\r\\ncontaminated by dust or germs which increase rapidly with the age of the\\r\\nmilk in proportion to the amount of dirt in it and with any increase of\\r\\ntemperature at which the milk is kept. So pasteurization and sterilization\\r\\nare done to destroy the effect of germs.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow can the acidity of cows\\' milk be overcome? By adding lime-water or\\r\\nbicarbonate of soda.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow much lime-water should be used? About one ounce to twenty ounces of\\r\\nfood.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow much bicarbonate of soda? About twenty grains to twenty ounces of food.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuppose there is a tendency to constipation in the infant? You can then\\r\\nuse Phillip\\'s milk of magnesia, or some other good preparation, adding\\r\\none-half to one teaspoonful to each twenty ounces of food.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow can the sugar be increased? By adding milk or granulated sugar to the\\r\\ncows\\' milk.\\r\\n\\r\\n[578 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nHow much milk sugar is added to twenty ounces of food? About one ounce\\r\\nwill do for the first three or four months. This makes it between six and\\r\\nseven per cent sugar.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow should you prepare the sugar? Dissolve it in boiled water and strain\\r\\nif there is a deposit after standing, by pouring it through a layer of\\r\\nabsorbent cotton one-half inch thick placed in an ordinary funnel.\\r\\n\\r\\nIs not granulated (cane) sugar recommended also? Yes; but all infants\\r\\ncannot use it. It is cheaper, but a good article of milk sugar should be\\r\\nbought. It costs from twenty to sixty cents per pound. The cheap variety\\r\\ncontains many impurities.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut if cane sugar is used, how much is needed? Usually about one-half or a\\r\\nlittle over one-half as much as milk sugar, or about one half ounce to\\r\\ntwenty ounces of food.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat occurs if too much is used? The sugar is likely to ferment in baby\\'s\\r\\nstomach and cause colic. The milk is made too sweet.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you continue to overfeed granulated sugar, what happens? Gas, colic,\\r\\nrestlessness, uneasiness, lining of the bowels becomes reddened and\\r\\nirritated; the redness shows externally around the rectum, and in severe\\r\\ncases around the hips.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnless the amount of sugar is now reduced, what occurs? There follow\\r\\nfrequently watery, splashy stools with much gas and foul odors.\\r\\n\\r\\nIs cane or granulated sugar safe to use after six months? It does not\\r\\nusually produce so much trouble later on.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuppose milk sugar produces irritation? The quantity used should be\\r\\nreduced to one ounce to twenty-five ounces of food or even less for a\\r\\nshort time.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a rule should milk sugar be preferred the first six months?  Yes.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat are the best grades of milk sugar? Merck\\'s, Mallinkrotz\\'s, or\\r\\nSquibb\\'s.\\r\\n\\r\\nIs sugar added to sweeten and make the milk palatable? No; although it\\r\\ndoes that, its use is to furnish one of the needed elements for the growth\\r\\nof the baby, and it is required by young infants in the largest quantity.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow do we know that this is true? Because in good mothers\\' milk the amount\\r\\nof sugar is greater than that of the fat, proteids, and salts combined.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs cows\\' milk has nearly three times as much proteids (curds) and salts as\\r\\nmothers\\' milk, how can these be diminished? By diluting the cows\\' milk.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow much should cow\\'s milk be diluted for a very young infant?  Diluted\\r\\ntwice will give almost the same proportion of proteids present as in\\r\\nmothers\\' milk, but as the proteids of cows\\' milk are so much harder for\\r\\nthe infant to digest, the milk should, in the beginning, be diluted five\\r\\nor six times for most infants.\\r\\n\\r\\n[ALL ABOUT BABY 579]\\r\\n\\r\\nDoes the diluted cows\\' milk with lime-water and sugar added resemble\\r\\nmothers\\' milk? No; for this mixture does not contain enough fat.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow can this be remedied? By increasing the fat in the milk before it is\\r\\ndiluted.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow is this done? By adding top milk or milk and cream.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat is the top-milk? It is the upper layer of milk, one-third or one-half\\r\\nof milk removed after it has stood a certain number of hours,--six to\\r\\neight hours.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow is the strength of the top-milk measured? By the fat it contains. A\\r\\nten per cent milk contains a ten per cent of fat; a seven per cent milk\\r\\ncontains a seven per cent of fat.\\r\\n\\r\\nAre these strengths used for infant feeding? Yes, they are most used.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat increases the percentage of fat in the top-milk? 1. The longer time\\r\\nit stands. 2. Manner of its removal. 3. Number of ounces removed. 4.\\r\\nThickness of the milk used.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen is top-milk removed? If milk is fresh from the cow or before the\\r\\ncream has risen, is bottled and rapidly cooled, it may be removed in four\\r\\nhours. It does not make much difference in bottled milk, and it may stand\\r\\nmuch longer.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow should top-milk be removed? Skim carefully off with a spoon, or cream-\\r\\ndipper (specially prepared) holding one ounce. It may be taken off with a\\r\\nglass or rubber syphon, never pour it off.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow can ten per cent top-milk be obtained from the different kinds of\\r\\ncow\\'s milk? From rather poor milk (three to three and one half per cent\\r\\nfat) remove the upper eight ounces from a quart.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow can it be obtained from good average milk (four per cent fat?) Remove\\r\\nthe upper eleven ounces or one-third.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom rich Jersey milk (five and five one-half per cent fat)? By removing\\r\\nsixteen ounces or upper one-half from the quart.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow is seven per cent top-milk obtained? 1. By removing the upper eleven\\r\\nounces or one-third of a quart from poor milk. 2. By removing the upper\\r\\nhalf from average milk. 3. By removing two-thirds or about twenty-two\\r\\nounces from rich Jersey milk. As stated before the seven per cent and ten\\r\\nper cent are the two kinds generally used.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf top-milk is treated in this way, is it like the human milk? The\\r\\nproportion of the fluids and solids are about the same, but the elements\\r\\nare different. The curd (albuminous element) is still different in\\r\\nstructure and action from the same element in human milk. The curd of\\r\\nhuman milk when it is met by the gastric juice in the stomach coagulates\\r\\nin minute particles, and the pepsin acts upon this very readily, but the\\r\\ncurd of cows\\' milk being much coarser and firmer coagulates under these\\r\\nconditions, into large hard clots or masses, and these are quite\\r\\nindigestible if the child\\'s stomach is sour from an under amount of acid\\r\\nbeing present.\\r\\n\\r\\n[580 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nHow can we prevent this? By adding some bland and nonirritating substance\\r\\nto the milk which will mingle with the particles of curd and separate them\\r\\nuntil the gastric juice can act upon each separate particle and digest it.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat can we use for this purpose? Barley or oatmeal water or gruel is\\r\\nbest.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat is cream? It is the part of the milk containing the most fat.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow is cream now obtained? By skimming after it has stood for twenty-four\\r\\nhours, \"gravity cream\"; by a separator, and it is then known as\\r\\n\"centrifugal cream\"; (most of the cream now sold in cities is \"centrifugal\\r\\ncream\").\\r\\n\\r\\nHow much fat has the usual \"gravity cream?\" Sixteen to twenty per cent.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow much fat is contained in cream removed from the upper one fifth of a\\r\\nbottle of milk? About sixteen per cent.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow much does the usual centrifugal cream contain? Eighteen to twenty per\\r\\ncent fat.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow much does the heavy centrifugal cream contain? Thirty-five to forty\\r\\nper cent fat.\\r\\n\\r\\nShould the milk be boiled for babies in the summer time? No, not usually.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFOOD FOR HEALTHY INFANTS.--FOR EARLY MONTHS.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese directions, etc., are for healthy infants. Directions for such as\\r\\nare suffering from digestive disturbances will be given later. I have in\\r\\npreceding pages given formulas for feeding children. I give these\\r\\nadditional, because not all children can be fed the same way and it may be\\r\\nwell to have the two sets of formulas.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat important parts are to be remembered when we are modifying cow\\'s milk\\r\\nfor the early month\\'s feeding? That sugar is the most easily digested, fat\\r\\ncomes next, while the proteids (curd) are the most difficult.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat relation should the fat and proteids bear to each other during the\\r\\nearlier periods? Usually in healthy infants the fat (cream) should be\\r\\nthree times the proteids (curds). Some healthy infants do not digest fat\\r\\nso well and they should have only twice as much fat as proteids\\r\\n(curds--skim-milk).\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat per cent milk must be used to obtain three times as much fat as\\r\\nproteids?\\r\\nTen per cent milk.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow can we obtain ten per cent milk? As top milk, described on another\\r\\npage, or by using plain milk and ordinary cream (sixteen per cent), in\\r\\nequal parts mixed; or it may be obtained directly from the milk\\r\\nlaboratories.\\r\\n\\r\\n[ALL ABOUT BABY 581]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhich is better to do, use the top-milk or mix plain milk and ordinary\\r\\ncream? If the milk is fresh from the cows, it is best then to use the\\r\\ntop-milk, because the food can then be made up after it is only a few\\r\\nhours old.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf one uses bottled milk, in cities, the upper third may be used, but if\\r\\nmilk and cream are bought separately it is usually more convenient to mix\\r\\nthese, as cream will not rise uniformly upon the milk a second time.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat per cent milk must be used to obtain twice as much fat as proteids?\\r\\nUse for dilution a seven per cent milk, that is, milk containing seven per\\r\\ncent fat, as in this milk the fat is just twice the proteids.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow is this obtained? Same as top-milk, described on another page; or by\\r\\nmixing three parts of plain milk and one part of ordinary cream (sixteen\\r\\nper cent), or by obtaining it directly from the milk laboratories.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow should we prepare the food for the early months? Granted you make up\\r\\ntwenty ounces at a time, first obtain the ten per cent, or seven per cent,\\r\\nmilk to be used, then take the number of ounces of this called for in the\\r\\nformula desired. One must remember that to make twenty ounces of food one\\r\\nounce of milk sugar (or three even tablespoonfuls) and one ounce of\\r\\nlime-water must be used.

A strong child with good\\r\\ndigestion can be given from the first series, ten per cent milk.\\r\\n\\r\\nA smaller, weaker child, and whose digestion is not so good, or with one\\r\\nwho has tried the first series and did not do well, should use the second\\r\\nseries of formulas.\\r\\n\\r\\n[582 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat is the reason the food is made so weak at first? The infant\\'s stomach\\r\\nis made to digest mother\\'s milk, not cows\\' milk, so we must begin with\\r\\nweak cows\\' milk, and the infant\\'s stomach can thus be trained to digest\\r\\nit. Strong milk would be very liable to seriously upset the child\\'s\\r\\ndigestion.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow rapidly can I increase the food in strength, that is, go from formula\\r\\n1 to 2, 3, 4, and 5, of either series? This can not be told, absolutely.\\r\\nIt depends upon the infant, how it bears the food. Usually you can begin\\r\\non formula one on the second day, formula two on the fourth day; three,\\r\\nafter seven or ten days, but after that make the increase slower. If the\\r\\ninfant is large, strong and of good digestion, he may be able to take of\\r\\nformula five by the time he is three or four weeks old. A weak child, or\\r\\none with feeble digestion must go much slower, and such an one may not\\r\\nreach formula five until it is three or four months old. Mothers should\\r\\nremember it is safer to increase the strength of the food very gradually;\\r\\nsome infants should have an increase of only one-half ounce instead of one\\r\\nounce; thus: three to three and one-half ounces, etc. Two or three days\\r\\nshould be allowed at least between each increase of food.\\r\\n\\r\\nMay I not go by a general rule in increasing the food? Yes, increase the\\r\\nfood when the infant is not satisfied, but is digesting well.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow does an infant show this? He drains the bottle hungrily and cries when\\r\\nit is taken away. He may begin to fret a half hour or so before the time\\r\\nfor the next feeding. He often sucks his fingers immediately after\\r\\nfeeding.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf I wish to prepare more than 20 ounces of food, what proportions shall I\\r\\nuse? To make 25 ounces, add one-fourth more of each ingredient. To make 30\\r\\nounces, add one-half more of each ingredient. To make 35 ounces, add\\r\\nthree-fourths more of each ingredient. To make 40 ounces, double each\\r\\ningredient.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor example, 25 ounces of food would call for--2-1/2 ounces of milk; 1-1/4\\r\\nounces of milk sugar; 1-1/4 ounces of lime-water; 21-1/4 ounces of boiled\\r\\nwater.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor 30 ounces of food, proportions would be--Milk, 3 ounces; milk sugar,\\r\\n1-1/2 ounces; lime-water, 1-1/2 ounces; boiled water, 25-1/2 ounces.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow much more should be made at one time? Five ounces may be made, but the\\r\\nfirst few days only two or three ounces of the additional should be given;\\r\\nfour ounces the next two days, and after two days more may give the five\\r\\nounces additional that has been made; that is, twenty-five ounces in all.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow much increase can be given at each feeding? Not more than one-quarter\\r\\nof an ounce.\\r\\n\\r\\n[ALL ABOUT BABY 583]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFOOD FOR HEALTHY INFANTS DURING THE LATER MONTHS.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHow long shall I continue this proportion, that is, the fat three times\\r\\nthe proteids (curd)--skim-milk?

After you are using formula\\r\\nfive of the first series; that is, six ounces of the ten per cent milk in\\r\\ntwenty ounces of milk, increase the fat slowly, for the proportion of fat\\r\\n(three per cent), is near the limit for healthy children.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow then shall I strengthen the milk?

The same formula may be continued sometimes for\\r\\nthree or four months with no other change, except an increase in the\\r\\nquantity of the food, that is from twenty ounces to twenty-five, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nIs it necessary or important to reduce the proportion of fat as it is at\\r\\nfirst, reduced in passing from formula five of the first series to formula\\r\\none of the third series? It is not necessary.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow much is this reduction? From 3 to 2.50 per cent.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow much increase of fat is there from the fifth formula of the second\\r\\nseries to the first formula of the third series? From 2.00 to 2.50 per\\r\\ncent.\\r\\n\\r\\nCan the first decrease be avoided? Yes, by taking off at first the upper\\r\\nthirteen ounces as top-milk, and using in a twenty-ounce mixture seven\\r\\nounces of this in place of formula No. 1, and also by using for the next\\r\\nincrease the upper fifteen ounces as top-milk--taking of this eight ounces\\r\\nin a twenty-ounce mixture in place of formula No. 2. Then follow three of\\r\\nthis third series. This is only done when you think the formulas two and\\r\\nthree of the third series do not give enough fat.\\r\\n\\r\\n[584 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES.]\\r\\n\\r\\nCan I add any other food about the sixth or seventh months?  Yes, foods in\\r\\nthe form of gruel, and have this take the place of part of the boiled\\r\\nwater and part of the sugar. Oatmeal and barley gruels can be added.\\r\\n\\r\\nCan I make further changes at ten or eleven months? The proteids\\r\\n(skim-milk) may be further increased, sugar and lime-water reduced until\\r\\nplain milk is given.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow can I do this? Give at first one feeding of plain milk and barley\\r\\ngruel daily; later two feedings, then three feedings, etc. For example,\\r\\nsuppose one infant was being fed with modified milk as formula 4 or 5,\\r\\nseries 3, six feedings daily. The plain milk diluted with boiling water\\r\\nwould take the place of one such feeding at first, then two, three, four,\\r\\netc., feedings. Such changes to be made at intervals of two weeks.\\r\\nProportions of milk and barley gruel should be, at first, about five and\\r\\none-half ounces milk, two and one-half ounces barley gruel; later six\\r\\nounces milk, three ounces barley gruel and then seven ounces milk, two\\r\\nounces barley gruel until plain milk is alone used, and this can usually\\r\\nbe reached at twelve to thirteen months. For five months\\' infants a pinch\\r\\nof soda may be added to each feeding when the lime-water is omitted. It is\\r\\nnot generally necessary, however.\\r\\n\\r\\nDo some infants dislike the milk after the milk sugar has been omitted?\\r\\nYes; for such 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoonful of granulated sugar may be added for\\r\\na time to each feeding and gradually reduced.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRULES FOR USING THESE FORMULAS.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey are only for healthy infants. Begin always with a weak formula,\\r\\nespecially with an infant previously nursed at the breast, with one just\\r\\nweaned and with infants who have poor digestive powers, or whose digestive\\r\\npowers are unknown. Should the first formula tried be too weak the food\\r\\ncan be strengthened every three or four days until the right formula is\\r\\nfound. If the food is made too strong at first an attack of indigestion is\\r\\nliable to follow.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow shall I increase the strength of the food? This should be done very\\r\\ngradually. Do not advance more than one formula in the given series. It is\\r\\nfrequently better to make the increase in half steps. Say when it is from\\r\\nthree to four, give three and one-half, and then four.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow rapidly can I increase the quantity of food? This should not be more\\r\\nthan one-fourth ounce in each feeding, one to one and one-half to two\\r\\nounces daily.\\r\\n\\r\\n[ALL ABOUT BABY 585]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen should the amount of food be increased? An increase may be necessary\\r\\nevery few days in the early weeks, but the same formula is often continued\\r\\nfor two or three months during the later months.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat signs in the infant demand an increase? The infant is not satisfied,\\r\\ndoes not gain in weight, but it has good digestion--that is, it does not\\r\\nvomit and has good stools.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen should I not increase the food? So long as the child is satisfied,\\r\\ngains four to six ounces weekly, even when the quantity and strength of\\r\\nthe food is considerably below the average.\\r\\n\\r\\nShould you then increase the food if the child seems somewhat hungry, but\\r\\nstill gains from eight to ten ounces weekly? It is not always a safe rule\\r\\nto be guided by the appetite.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow can I know whether to increase the strength or the quantity of the\\r\\nfood? In the early weeks it is well first to increase the strength, the\\r\\nnext time the quantity of the food, then the strength, then the quantity,\\r\\netc. The quantity chiefly should be increased after the fourth or fifth\\r\\nmonth.\\r\\n\\r\\nShould a slight stomach discomfort or disturbance follow after the food\\r\\nhas been strengthened, what shall I do? If the disturbance is marked and\\r\\ncontinues and the infant does not seem able to accustom itself to the new\\r\\nfood, you should go back to the weaker one and the next increase should be\\r\\nsmaller.\\r\\n\\r\\nShould I be worried if the gain in weight for the first few weeks of\\r\\nartificial feeding is slight, or even no gain? Not as a rule; if the\\r\\ninfant loses no weight, sleeps well, is comfortable, does not suffer from\\r\\nvomiting, nausea, colic, you can feel sure the baby is doing well and is\\r\\nbecoming used to his new food. As his appetite improves and his digestion\\r\\nis stronger the food may be increased every few days. Then the weight will\\r\\nsoon increase.\\r\\n\\r\\nIs constipation likely to occur from such a weak food? This is very often\\r\\nseen owing to the fact of their being little residue in the bowels, so if\\r\\nhe has a daily stool, even if it is small and dry, it need not cause worry\\r\\nas it soon passes away with the using of stronger food.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat circumstances indicate that the food should be reduced? When the\\r\\nchild becomes ill from any causes, or when there are any marked symptoms\\r\\nof indigestion.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow can I reduce the food? If there is but a slight disturbance and the\\r\\ndaily food has been prepared, pour off one-third from each bottle just\\r\\nbefore each feeding and replace this quantity of food with boiled water;\\r\\nif the disturbance is more severe, immediately dilute the food at least\\r\\none-half and also reduce, at the same time the quantity given; for a\\r\\nsevere attack of indigestion, omit the regular food altogether and give\\r\\nonly boiled water until a doctor has been called.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow shall I return to the original formula after it has been reduced for a\\r\\ndisturbance of digestion? The increase must be very gradual after the\\r\\nimmediate reduction. After a severe attack of indigestion, the milk should\\r\\nnot be made more than one-fifth the original strength, and ten days or two\\r\\nweeks should elapse before the original strength food is given and, as\\r\\nstated, there should be a gradual slow increase.\\r\\n\\r\\n[586 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nABOUT ADDING OTHER FOODS TO MILK.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow long shall I continue the modified milk? Usually for about six months;\\r\\nbut if the infant is doing well you can continue it for ten or eleven\\r\\nmonths. If the infant has trouble in digesting cows\\' milk other foods can\\r\\nbe added at three or four months or even at the beginning.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat food can I first use? Barley, oatmeal, arrowroot, and farina.\\r\\n\\r\\nIs it better to make them from the flour? Yes, they are more simple to\\r\\nprepare from the flour.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow shall I cook them? Cook them separately, and when used they take the\\r\\nplace of some of the boiled water.\\r\\n\\r\\n(For another way, see former pages.)\\r\\n\\r\\nHow shall I prepare barley gruel water? Take one teaspoonful of the flour\\r\\nand rub it up with a little cold water, and then stir this into a pint of\\r\\nboiling water; add a pinch of salt and boil it fifteen minutes; strain if\\r\\nit is lumpy. Oatmeal gruel is made the same way, only using two\\r\\nteaspoonfuls instead of one.\\r\\n\\r\\nBarley Jelly.--One rounded tablespoonful of the flour, mixed with a little\\r\\ncold water, is added to one pint of boiling water containing a pinch of\\r\\nsalt; cook twenty minutes in a double boiler and strain. A thinner gruel\\r\\n(barley water) is made by using half of the quantity of flour.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow much of the gruel can I use? If prepared by the last method one-sixth\\r\\nto one-half the total quantity of food; if the barley water is used it\\r\\ncan be used in greater quantity if desired, as it is weaker by half.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhich one shall I use? Barley and oatmeal are generally used; oatmeal is\\r\\nmore laxative.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat is their value as infant foods? Their chief value is to prevent the\\r\\ncurd from coagulating in the stomach in hard masses, thus rendering it\\r\\nmore digestible.\\r\\n\\r\\nWould you advise this addition for all infants? No, for it does not agree\\r\\nwith them all, and so it cannot be recommended for all infants.\\r\\n\\r\\nCan I give anything more during the first year? Beef juice, white of an\\r\\negg, and orange juice.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow and when may I use the beef juice? It may be begun at ten or eleven\\r\\nmonths in infants who are strong and thriving well. Two teaspoonfuls may\\r\\nbe given daily, diluted with same amount of water, fifteen minutes before\\r\\nthe midday feeding; in two weeks it may be doubled; and six teaspoonfuls\\r\\ncan be given, in four weeks. Two or three tablespoonfuls is all that can\\r\\nbe given a child of one year.\\r\\n\\r\\n[ALL ABOUT BABY 587]\\r\\n\\r\\nIs beef juice of value in delicate pale infants? Yes, of much value, and\\r\\nit is more important for them, and it may sometimes be given them at five\\r\\nor six months in one-half the quantity mentioned.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen shall I give the white of egg (albumen) or albumin water? When the\\r\\nconditions are similar to those requiring beef juice especially in infants\\r\\nwho digest the proteids (curd) with difficulty. You can give the one-half\\r\\nof the white of one egg at six months, and soon the entire white of one\\r\\negg can be given.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat is the best way of preparing this? By coddling the egg.\\r\\n\\r\\nDescribe the way of preparation? Place a fresh egg with the shell on in\\r\\nboiling water and immediately remove all from the fire. The egg cooks\\r\\nslowly in the water for seven or eight minutes as the water gradually\\r\\ncools, and the white part becomes like jelly. Give the white with only a\\r\\npinch of salt--it can be easily separated from the yolk.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen can I give orange juice? Usually about the eleventh or twelfth month,\\r\\nand it should be given about one hour before the feeding. You can begin\\r\\nwith two teaspoonfuls at first, then one tablespoonful at a time, and\\r\\nlater three or four tablespoonfuls. Orange juice is very good when\\r\\nconstipation exists--strain it always, and it must be always fresh and\\r\\nsweet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOVER NURSING.\\r\\n\\r\\nMothers who have a very large supply of milk are very likely to overfeed\\r\\ntheir babies if the milk is of good quality. This will drain the mother\\'s\\r\\nstrength. Some mothers allow their babies to nurse to relieve the\\r\\nuncomfortable feeling. If the infant vomits the surplus immediately they\\r\\nare not injured. Where the baby does not vomit, the surplus food passes\\r\\ninto the bowels and causes colic and green and yellow gassy stools. If the\\r\\nmother\\'s milk is too rich, only, and not too much and the baby vomits,\\r\\nthis can be corrected by giving the baby some boiled water before each\\r\\nmeal. The baby will not nurse so much then.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOVER-FEEDING.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat do you mean by this term? The infant gets too much food, and this is\\r\\nchiefly done at night.\\r\\n\\r\\nCan I depend upon the infant\\'s natural desire for food as to the quantity\\r\\nto be given? Not always, the habit of over-eating is frequently acquired,\\r\\nand is frequently seen in infants with a good digestion.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat harm results from over-feeding an infant? The food lies in the\\r\\nstomach or bowels, undigested, ferments, and causes gas and colic, and if\\r\\nthe over-feeding is long continued, serious trouble arises. The baby\\r\\nbecomes restless, fretful, irritable, sleeps badly, stops gaining weight\\r\\nand may lose weight.\\r\\n\\r\\n[588 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES ]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLOSS OF APPETITE.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat may cause this? Over-feeding or the use of milk too rich in fat.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat can I do for this trouble? If the child is well, offer food to him at\\r\\nregular hours only. Do not coax or force him to eat even though he takes\\r\\nonly one-half or one-third of his usual quantity. Lengthen the intervals\\r\\nbetween the feedings. It may be necessary with a child under a year old to\\r\\nreduce the number of feedings to three or four in twenty-four hours. Give\\r\\nwater at more frequent intervals, weaken instead of strengthening the\\r\\nfood.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFOODS FOR SPECIAL CONDITIONS.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome infants with weak digestive powers, and those suffering from various\\r\\nforms of indigestion, have often much trouble in digesting the fat of\\r\\nmilk. To meet such troubles a series of formulas are given obtained from\\r\\nplain milk.\\r\\n\\r\\nFOURTH SERIES-Formulas containing four per cent fat:\\r\\n                1      2     3       4       5       6       7       8\\r\\nPlain Milk     5 oz.  6 oz.  7 oz.  8 oz.   9 oz.   10 oz.  12 oz.  14 oz.\\r\\n*Milk Sugar    1 oz   1 oz.  1 oz.  1 oz  3/4 oz.  3/4 oz. 1/2 oz. 1/2 oz.\\r\\nLime-water     1 oz.  l oz.  1 oz.  1 oz.   1 oz.    1 oz.   1 oz.   1 oz.\\r\\nBoiled water  14 oz. 13 oz. 12 oz.  7 oz.   6 oz.    5 oz.   2 oz.   0 oz.\\r\\nBarley Gruel.  0 oz.  0 oz.  0 oz.  4 oz.   4 oz.    4 oz.   5 oz.   5 oz.\\r\\n              -----  -----  -----   -----   -----   -----    -----   -----\\r\\n              20 oz. 20 oz. 20 oz. 20 oz.  20 oz.   20 oz.   20 oz. 20 oz.\\r\\n\\r\\n*(Milk sugar is not counted in totals.) If more than twenty ounces are\\r\\nneeded get the proportions by adding one-fourth, one-half, three-quarters,\\r\\nor double each ingredient.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy does an infant so often vomit some of its food soon after feeding? The\\r\\nquantity may be too large or too rich food, the baby may feed too fast,\\r\\nthe hole in the nipple may be too large, the clothing too tight, or you\\r\\nmay press upon its stomach in moving the baby.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat are the causes of and changes needed for stomach troubles?  It is\\r\\nusually a symptom of indigestion and is frequently caused by too much fat\\r\\nor sugar.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow can I remedy this? Reduce the fat or sugar, and increase the\\r\\nlime-water. Avoid the formulas made from the top-milk, or cream and milk.\\r\\nThose made from the seven per cent milk are not so likely to cause\\r\\ntrouble; but you had better, if the symptoms are severe, use formulas of\\r\\nthe fourth series.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat symptoms indicate that the baby is getting too much fat (cream)?\\r\\nVomiting and yellow, foul, greasy, or ropy stools.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow much shall I reduce the milk sugar? Use only one-half ounce to twenty\\r\\nounces of food or leave it out altogether.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow shall I know when to reduce the sugar, etc.? When there is excessive\\r\\nformation of gas in the stomach, causing distention and pain, or belchings\\r\\nof gas, and often a sour stomach. Reduce the amount of sugar and increase\\r\\nthe lime-water one and one-half to two ounces in twenty ounces of food,\\r\\nincrease intervals between the meats one-half hour and give less quantity.\\r\\n\\r\\n[ALL ABOUT BABY 589]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat food usually causes habitual colic? This is due to gas accumulating\\r\\nin the bowels, and is usually caused by the want of digestion of the\\r\\nproteids (curd).\\r\\n\\r\\nHow shall I overcome this? Use a weaker formula. Use formula 4 or 3 of\\r\\nfirst series; or use partially pasteurized milk, or use barley water\\r\\ninstead of plain water.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf curds regularly or frequently appear in the stools, what changes shall\\r\\nI make? This usually accompanies colic, so use means just\\r\\ndescribed--reduce the proteids (skim milk).\\r\\n\\r\\nHow shall I modify the milk for chronic constipation? This is difficult to\\r\\novercome, and it is more frequent when infants are fed upon a plain milk\\r\\ndiet, variously diluted, than when seven or ten per cent milk is used and\\r\\ndiluted to a greater degree. But you cannot use food containing more than\\r\\nfour per cent fat, that is, eight ounces of ten per cent milk or twelve\\r\\nounces of seven per cent milk in twenty ounces of food. In some cases\\r\\nordinary brown sugar in one-half the quantity can take the place of milk\\r\\nsugar, or Mellin\\'s food, malted milk or cereal milk can be used in the\\r\\nplace of the milk sugar. Milk of magnesia can be used for lime-water as\\r\\nbefore directed. Orange juice can be given to infants over nine months\\r\\nold.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat modifications should I make in very hot weather? The proportion of\\r\\nfat (top-milk or milk and cream mixed) should be less and when it is very\\r\\nhot, for a short period, it should be much less. Use seven per cent milk\\r\\nin place of ten per cent, that is, formulas from the second series, or\\r\\nplain milk, in place of the seven per cent milk, fourth series.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf a child has good digestion, but gains very little or no weight, what\\r\\nchanges in the food should I make? Increase the quantity of the food if\\r\\nthe child seems hungry; or increase the strength of the food, if the child\\r\\nwill not take a greater quantity; do not coax or force the baby to eat,\\r\\ngive him more sleep; fresh air, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf there is no modified milk that will agree with the baby, what shall I\\r\\ndo? If the infant is under four or five months old, a wet nurse would\\r\\nlikely succeed. If a wet nurse cannot be obtained or if the child is older\\r\\nuse some of the substitutes for cows\\' milk, like Borden\\'s Eagle Brand,\\r\\ncanned or condensed milk. This is better to use when the trouble is in the\\r\\nbowels and shows colic, gas, curds in the stools, constipation, or\\r\\ndiarrhea. If it is due to indigestion it shows in vomiting, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow shall I use condensed milk? The directions are on the bottle. But if\\r\\nthe baby is three or four months old, and has symptoms of indigestion,\\r\\ndilute its food with sixteen parts of boiled water, or sometimes barley\\r\\nwater if there is no constipation. As the symptoms improve it can be made\\r\\nstronger, one to fourteen, one to twelve one to ten, one to eight, such\\r\\nchanges to be made gradually.\\r\\n\\r\\n[590 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nHow long can I use the condensed milk? Generally for a few weeks only as\\r\\nthe sole food, then give one feeding a day of modified milk, for instance,\\r\\nNo. 3 or 4 of the series; later two feedings and gradually increase until\\r\\nthe milk feeding is entirely used.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy can I not continue to use condensed milk? It is very low in fat and\\r\\nproteids and has much sugar in it; children who take this food for\\r\\nsometime often gain rapidly in strength and weight, yet have not much\\r\\nresistance, and they are very prone to develop rickets and scurvy.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuppose baby is teething, has a cold, sore throat, etc., what change shall\\r\\nI make? Dilute the food for two or three feedings by using boiled water in\\r\\nplace of an ounce or two of food; this much to be removed from the bottle\\r\\nbefore being given; if it is necessary to continue for several days, use a\\r\\nweaker formula.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat changes shall I make in this for serious acute sickness? For,\\r\\ndiseases with fever like measles, bronchitis, pneumonia, etc., dilute the\\r\\nfood and reduce the fat (cream from top-milk). Give the food at regular\\r\\nintervals, but not so often. Do not force food in the early part of acute\\r\\nsickness.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuppose baby has acute gastritis, what changes shall I make? Stop all food\\r\\nand give boiled water, only, for ten or more hours, then try barley water\\r\\nor whey, but do not give any milk for at least twenty-four hours after all\\r\\nvomiting has ceased. When you again begin the modified milk use a small\\r\\nquantity with a low proportion of fat, and you can secure this by using a\\r\\nformula from the fourth series. You may also double the proportion of\\r\\nlime-water.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf baby is attacked with intestinal indigestion accompanied by loose\\r\\nbowels, what food shall I give? If it has but two or three passages daily,\\r\\nlower the proportion of fat (cream, etc.), in the manner above directed,\\r\\nand boil the milk for five minutes. Dilute it still more if curds are\\r\\npresent in the stools.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut suppose the attack is more severe? If there is fever and the passages\\r\\nsmell badly and are more frequent, stop all milk and use the diet given\\r\\nfor acute gastritis. (Acute indigestion).\\r\\n\\r\\nDo other conditions besides the food influence digestion? Yes, use proper\\r\\nclothing, keep warm feet, regular habits, fresh air. Clean bottles and\\r\\nfood, given at proper intervals and temperature, quiet surroundings and\\r\\nabsence of excitement are needed.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat common mistakes are often made in modifying milk and feeding infants?\\r\\nNever fail to follow the directions given for removing the top-milk.\\r\\nRemove all the top-milk of any given strength in making a formula, and\\r\\nnot only the number of ounces needed for the formula. By using rich Jersey\\r\\nmilk as if it were more common milk. The formulas given are based upon\\r\\nabout four per cent fat. Food is very often increased too rapidly,\\r\\nparticularly after stomach and bowel indigestion. The food in an infant of\\r\\nthree or four months old attacked by acute indigestion should seldom be\\r\\ngiven in full strength for two weeks afterwards, only half steps should be\\r\\ntaken like two to two and one-half, etc. Another mistake, when indigestion\\r\\nsymptoms show the food is not reduced quickly enough; reduce the food\\r\\nimmediately by at least one-half.\\r\\n\\r\\n[ALL ABOUT BABY 591]\\r\\n\\r\\nHow to prepare cows\\' milk at home; what is needed? Feeding bottles, rubber\\r\\nnipples, an eight-ounce graduated measuring glass, a glass funnel, a brush\\r\\nfor bottles, cotton, alcohol lamp, a tall quart cup for warming bottles of\\r\\nmilk, a pitcher for mixing food, a wide mouthed bottle of boric acid and\\r\\none of bicarbonate of soda, a pasteurizer, and later a double boiler for\\r\\ncooking cereals will be needed.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat kind of bottles shall I buy? A cylindrical graduated bottle with a\\r\\nwide neck holding about 8 ounces. This makes washing them easier. You\\r\\nshould have as many bottles for use as the baby takes meals a day (ten at\\r\\nfirst).\\r\\n\\r\\nHow shall I care for the bottles? Rinse them, as soon as the child is\\r\\nthrough nursing, with cold water, and let stand filled with cold water and\\r\\na little bicarbonate of soda in the water. Before using them again wash\\r\\nthem thoroughly with the bottle brush and hot soap suds and place them for\\r\\ntwenty minutes in boiling water.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat kind of nipples are best? Straight ones which slip over the neck of\\r\\nthe bottle, of black rubber, and the hole should only be large enough for\\r\\nthe milk to drop rapidly when the bottle is held upside down.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow shall I care for the nipples? Boil new ones for five minutes at first.\\r\\nAfter using rinse them carefully in cold water and keep them covered in a\\r\\nglass containing a solution of borax or boric acid. Turn them inside out\\r\\nonce a day and wash thoroughly with soap and water.\\r\\n\\r\\n(There is a slight difference in the directions given by different\\r\\nauthorities as to cleaning bottles and nipples, but the general way is the\\r\\nsame.)\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat kind of cotton shall I use for corking the bottles? Refined\\r\\nnon-absorbent cotton is best, but the ordinary absorbent cotton will do.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhich is the best--an alcohol lamp, or the Bunsen burner? The Bunsen\\r\\nburner is the best, cheaper and simpler if there is gas in the house.\\r\\nShould you use the lamp, put it upon a table covered with a plate of zinc\\r\\nor tin, or upon a large tin tray. The French pattern is the best.\\r\\n\\r\\nGive special directions now for preparing the food according to any of the\\r\\ngiven formulas? The hands must be clean, as well as everything else--food\\r\\nand utensils. First dissolve the milk sugar in boiling water, filtering,\\r\\nif necessary, then add to the boiled water and sugar the milk, cream, and\\r\\nlime-water, mixing all in the pitcher; a sufficient quantity for\\r\\ntwenty-four hours is always prepared at one time. Divide this in equal\\r\\nquantities into the number of feedings for the twenty-four hours and cork\\r\\nthe bottles with the cotton cork and cool the bottles rapidly, after\\r\\nhaving been pasteurized by standing first in tepid and then in cold water,\\r\\nand then place in an ice chest at 50 degrees F.\\r\\n\\r\\n[592 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFEEDING DIRECTIONS.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow shall I prepare the bottle at feeding time? Take one from the ice\\r\\nchest, warm it by placing it in warm water deep enough to cover the milk\\r\\nin the bottle. Then thoroughly shake it, remove the cotton cork, and\\r\\nadjust the nipple.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow shall I know that the temperature of the milk is correct? Pour a\\r\\nteaspoonful from the bottle before adjusting the nipple, and taste it, or\\r\\npour a few drops through the nipple upon the inner surface of the wrist.\\r\\nIt should feel quite warm, but not quite hot; or a baby thermometer may be\\r\\nplaced in the water where the milk stands, and the temperature should be\\r\\nbetween 98 and 100 degrees F.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow can I keep the milk warm while the baby is feeding? Slip over the\\r\\nbottle a warm flannel bag with a draw-string.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat position should a child be in when feeding? During the first few\\r\\nmonths, except at night, it had better be held in the arms; later it can\\r\\nlie on its side in the crib, but the bottle must then be held by the nurse\\r\\nuntil it is emptied, or the baby will nurse and sleep, and nurse and\\r\\nsleep, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow much time shall I give the baby for one feeding? Not longer than\\r\\ntwenty minutes. Take the bottle away then and do not give it until the\\r\\nnext feeding. Keep a sleepy baby awake, when well, until the food is\\r\\ntaken, or remove the bottle.\\r\\n\\r\\nCan I play with the baby after feeding? Never. It may cause vomiting and\\r\\nindigestion. Baby should lie quietly and sleep if possible, or at least\\r\\nnot be disturbed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFEEDING INTERVALS.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow often shall I nurse or feed baby during the first month? Ten times in\\r\\ntwenty-four hours at intervals of two hours during the day and two times\\r\\nat night.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy can I not feed baby oftener? Because it takes nearly two hours to\\r\\ndigest a meal at two months, about two and one-half hours at five or six\\r\\nmonths, and if another meal is given before the former meal is digested,\\r\\nvomiting and indigestion will result. The following schedule is given by\\r\\none authority on children for healthy infants for the first year:\\r\\n\\r\\n                            Night      No.       Quantity      Quantity\\r\\n                 Interval   feedings   of        for           for\\r\\n                 between    10 P.

The smaller amounts are required by\\r\\nsmaller children with weak digestion; the larger amounts are required by\\r\\nlarge children with strong digestion. The interval is from the beginning\\r\\nof one feeding to the beginning of the next feeding.\\r\\n\\r\\n[ALL ABOUT BABY 593]\\r\\n\\r\\nHow soon can I make the intervals at two and one-half hours?  Generally at\\r\\nfive or six weeks.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen may I increase it to three hours? Usually at eight weeks or two\\r\\nmonths.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen should I lengthen the interval between feedings? When there is poor\\r\\nstomach digestion.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow is this shown? By habitual vomiting or regurgitation of food long\\r\\nafter nursing is finished; also when the baby has a very poor appetite so\\r\\nthat it always leaves some of its food.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen can I shorten the intervals? It is not generally advisable to feed\\r\\nany baby oftener than given by this schedule.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nREGULAR FEEDING.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow can I teach baby to take regular meals? By commencing at birth to feed\\r\\nat exactly regular hours every day.\\r\\n\\r\\nShall I awaken baby to feed it? Yes, for a few days. In a short time he\\r\\nwill waken at the same hours himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nShould this regularity extend through the night? Only up to nine or ten\\r\\no\\'clock. After ten let him sleep as long as he will.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow soon can baby go without food from 10 p. m. to 7 a. m.? At four months\\r\\nusually and always at five or six months; night feeding causes\\r\\nrestlessness and poor sleep.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSTERILIZED MILK.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat do you mean by sterilizing milk? It means to heat milk so as to\\r\\ndestroy the germs.\\r\\n\\r\\nDoes cows\\' milk contain germs? Yes, even if it is handled faultlessly; but\\r\\nwhen carelessly handled the number of germs is enormous.\\r\\n\\r\\nAre all of the germs injurious? Most are harmless or cause only the\\r\\nsouring of the milk.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat other germs are occasionally present? Typhoid fever, diphtheria,\\r\\nscarlet fever, cholera, tuberculosis and many forms of diarrhea germs.\\r\\n\\r\\nDo I need to sterilize milk under all circumstances? When you cannot\\r\\nobtain it fresh in warm weather. Hence during warm weather in cities and\\r\\ntowns; when you do not know that the cows are healthy or that the milk has\\r\\nbeen cleanly handled; when milk is kept over twenty-four hours, especially\\r\\nif there is no ice at hand. When there are epidemics of typhoid fever,\\r\\nscarlet fever, diphtheria, or any form of bowel disease accompanied by\\r\\ndiarrhea.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow many methods of heating milk are there? First, sterilizing, in which\\r\\nthe milk is heated to 212 degrees F., for one hour or one and one-half\\r\\nhours. Second, pasteurizing, when you heat the milk to 155 degrees or 170\\r\\ndegrees F. for thirty minutes.\\r\\n\\r\\n[594 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nWill the temperature of 155 degrees F. for one-half hour be sufficient to\\r\\nkill the germs of the diseases mentioned above? Generally.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow long will milk so treated keep on ice? Heated to 212 degrees F. for an\\r\\nhour will keep for two or three weeks; that heated (pasteurized) to 155\\r\\ndegrees F. will keep for two or three days.\\r\\n\\r\\nIs cows\\' milk as digestible when sterilized? No, and it should be modified\\r\\nfor infant feeding the same as milk not heated.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen milk is heated for an hour to 212 degrees F. (sterilization), is it\\r\\ninjured in any way? It is rendered harder to digest, and is more\\r\\nconstipating; scurvy may be caused if it is used as the sole food for a\\r\\nlong time. It is so objectionable that the method is not recommended for\\r\\ngeneral use.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen should I heat it 212 degrees F.? For use on long journeys of days\\r\\ntraveling. Then you should heat for one hour upon two successive days,\\r\\nleaving the cotton stoppers in the bottles.\\r\\n\\r\\nDoes heating milk to 155 degrees F. for one-half hour injure it in any\\r\\nway? It does not affect the taste or make it more constipating. The\\r\\nunfavorable effects, if any, are slight. Get clean and fresh milk and the\\r\\neffects will be really of no account.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat pasteurizer would you recommend. Freeman\\'s or Walker-Gordon.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat shall I do with the milk after it has been pasteurized? Cool it\\r\\nquickly by placing the bottles in cold water--never leave them in the room\\r\\nwhere pasteurized, and never place them, when warm, in an ice chest.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy this caution? Because it requires from two to four hours to cool them\\r\\nin the air, or in the ice box, and during that time a good many\\r\\nundeveloped germs may mature and injure the keeping properties of the\\r\\nmilk. You can cool the bottles of milk in cool water in from ten to twenty\\r\\nminutes if you change the water frequently, or if ice is put into the\\r\\nwater.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat is modified milk of the laboratories? It is milk containing fat,\\r\\nsugar, proteids, etc., in definite proportions put up, usually, according\\r\\nto a physician\\'s directions.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPEPTONIZED MILK.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat is peptonized milk? Milk that has been partially digested.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat part of the milk has been digested? The proteids (curd).\\r\\n\\r\\nDoes this alter its taste? No, if it is peptonized for only ten minutes,\\r\\nbut if it is fully peptonized the milk has a bitter taste.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow can the bitter taste be avoided in partly peptonized milk? At the end\\r\\nof ten or fifteen minutes place the milk in a sauce-pan and raise it\\r\\nquickly to the boiling point; this kills the ferment so that the milk will\\r\\nnot become bitter when it is warmed for feeding; or the milk can be cooled\\r\\nrapidly by placing the bottles first in cool and then in ice water; but in\\r\\nthis way the ferment is not destroyed, and the milk may become bitter when\\r\\nwarmed for feeding.\\r\\n\\r\\n[ALL ABOUT BABY 595]\\r\\n\\r\\nHow is milk peptonized? By the action of a peptonizing powder composed of\\r\\na digestive agent known as the extractum pancreatis and bicarbonate of\\r\\nsoda. This is added to the plain or diluted milk. This agent can be bought\\r\\nin tubes or tablets, and is the active ingredient of the peptogenic\\r\\npowder.\\r\\n\\r\\nWill you describe the process? Place the plain or modified milk in a clean\\r\\nglass jar or bottle, and then rub up the peptonizing powder or tablet with\\r\\na tablespoonful of milk, and add it to the milk and shake the bottle.\\r\\nPlace the bottle in a large pitcher or basin of water of about 110 degrees\\r\\nF., or as warm as the hand can bear comfortably, and allow it to remain\\r\\nfor ten to twenty minutes if you wish to peptonize the milk but partially;\\r\\nor if you wish it completely peptonized let it remain for two hours.\\r\\n\\r\\nIs it better to peptonize the whole day\\'s supply, or each bottle\\r\\nseparately just before feeding? If you peptonize the whole day\\'s supply at\\r\\nonce raise the milk to the boiling point after it has been peptonized; if\\r\\nonly the one feeding do not peptonize it more than ten minutes before\\r\\nfeeding for the ferment will work while the child is feeding. It can be\\r\\ndone either way.\\r\\n\\r\\nIs not the completely peptonized milk distasteful? Not so in the case of\\r\\nyoung infants; older infants will take a few feedings without objection,\\r\\nbut it cannot be used for children much older than five months.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow much of the agent should be used? For a single feeding of four ounces\\r\\none may use one-eighth of a tube with a weak formula of milk or one-sixth\\r\\nwith a stronger formula. For one pint of plain milk five grains of the\\r\\nextract and fifteen grains of bicarbonate of soda will be needed. This\\r\\namount is usually put up in one tube or tablet. Less will be required in\\r\\nweaker formulas of modified milk.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat advantages has peptonized milk? Partially peptonized milk assists\\r\\ngreatly in digesting the curd of milk. Young infants sometimes have\\r\\ntrouble in digesting the curd. When completely peptonized it is good in\\r\\nattacks of acute indigestion.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow long may I give it? It may be used for a few days when completely\\r\\npeptonized; when partially peptonized it can be used for two or three\\r\\nmonths, and when you wish to give other food, leave off its use gradually\\r\\nby shortening the time of peptonizing and lessening the quantity of the\\r\\npowder used.\\r\\n\\r\\n[596 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nFEEDING DURING THE SECOND YEAR\\r\\n\\r\\nHow many meals should a child have during the second year?  Five.\\r\\n\\r\\nShall I prepare the milk for all day at one time? It is better to prepare\\r\\nthe milk for all day during the second and third years. If you wish to\\r\\nmodify it by adding cream, water, etc., prepare as done during the first\\r\\nyear, and later when only plain milk is used, the quantities needed for\\r\\nthe different feedings should be put into one or two bottles, pasteurized\\r\\nor not as necessary. In this way the different feedings are kept separate.\\r\\nPrepare the food as soon as possible in the morning alter the milk has\\r\\nbeen received.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFOR A HEALTHY CHILD OF TWELVE MONTHS.\\r\\n\\r\\n6:30 a. m. or 7:00 a. m.--Milk, six to seven ounces, diluted with two or\\r\\nthree ounces of barley or oatmeal gruel, and taken from a cup after\\r\\nthirteen months.\\r\\n\\r\\n9:00 a. m.--One to two ounces of orange juice.\\r\\n\\r\\n10:00 a. m.--Milk two parts, oatmeal or barley gruel one part, and from\\r\\nten to twelve ounces in all may be given in a cup.\\r\\n\\r\\n2 :00 p. m.--One or two ounces of beef juice, or the white of one egg,\\r\\nslightly cooked, and later an entire egg or mutton or chicken broth, four\\r\\nto six ounces.\\r\\n\\r\\n6:00 p. m.--Same as 10 a. m.\\r\\n\\r\\n10:00 p. m.--Same as at 6:30 a. m., except the milk can be taken from the\\r\\nbottle.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow long can this schedule be given? Until the fourteenth or fifteenth\\r\\nmonth, and then you can give the cereals thicker and with a spoon.\\r\\n\\r\\nCan I give other fruit juices at fourteen or fifteen months? Orange juice\\r\\nis the best, but the juice of ripe peaches, red raspberries or\\r\\nstrawberries in the order given, is good. Strain all carefully through\\r\\nmuslin, for the pulp or seeds might cause serious trouble. You may now\\r\\ngive one to four tablespoonfuls of the orange or peach juice, and about\\r\\none-half the quantity of the others.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen shall I give the fruit juices? One hour before the second meal.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat diet shall I give between fourteenth and eighteenth months?\\r\\n\\r\\n6:00 to 6:30 a. m.--Eight to ten ounces of plain milk from a cup.\\r\\n\\r\\n8:00 to 9:00 a. m.--Juice of one-half orange strained.\\r\\n\\r\\n10:00 a. m.--One, or later two or three tablespoonfuls of oatmeal or\\r\\nbarley jelly, hominy cooked at least three hours, and on which you may put\\r\\na little top-milk; a pinch of salt; no sugar and cup--about six ounces--of\\r\\nmilk to drink; crisp dry toast, one piece.\\r\\n\\r\\n2:00 p. m.--Beef juice one to two ounces, a soft boiled; coddled or\\r\\npoached egg, and a tablespoonful of boiled rice, or mutton or chicken\\r\\nbroth, four ounces; one or two pieces of stale bread or zwieback; and if\\r\\nmost of the teeth are present, one scant teaspoonful of scraped rare beef,\\r\\nslowly increased to one tablespoonful, alternating with two ounces of beef\\r\\njuice and a salt-boiled or coddled egg. (Some advise a little prune jelly,\\r\\napple sauce, a baked apple or junket as a dessert). No milk, but little\\r\\nwater can be taken.\\r\\n\\r\\n[ALL ABOUT BABY 597]\\r\\n\\r\\n6:00 p. m.--Two tablespoonfuls of thoroughly cooked farina, or cream of\\r\\nwheat or granum, or arrow-root, on which is a little top-milk; salt, but\\r\\nno sugar, and eight ounces of warm milk which may be taken from the\\r\\nbottle.\\r\\n\\r\\n10:00 p. m.--Warmed milk and eight to twelve ounces if necessary, by\\r\\nbottle.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow shall I prepare the beef? Take round or sirloin steak and scrape it\\r\\nwith a large spoon on both sides, so that you obtain the pulp only, salt\\r\\nit a little, and place it with a very tiny piece of butter in a saucer,\\r\\ncover it with another saucer, remove the cover from the boiling teakettle,\\r\\nand place the saucer in its place; let it steam until it is just heated\\r\\nthrough, as it must look rare when done, Give at first one teaspoonful and\\r\\ngradually work up to one tablespoonful, but do not begin this diet in\\r\\nmidsummer. Give baby plenty of water to drink between meals, boil and\\r\\ncool.\\r\\n\\r\\nA diet for the eighteenth month to end of twenty-fourth month? Follow the\\r\\nsame order. For most children milk at 10 p. m. is desirable; but if a\\r\\nchild sleeps during the whole night it is not necessary to wake it at 10\\r\\np. m. for the feeding.\\r\\n\\r\\n6:00 or 6:30 a. m.--Warmed milk ten to twelve ounces.\\r\\n\\r\\n9:00 a. m.--Two or three ounces of fruit juices.\\r\\n\\r\\n10:00 a. m.--Cereals similar to the last schedule; they need not be\\r\\nstrained, but well cooked; crisp, dry bread, zwieback, warmed milk one\\r\\ncup.\\r\\n\\r\\n2 :00 p. m.--Beef juice and one egg or broth and meat; beef-steak, mutton\\r\\nchop or roast beef scraped, very stale bread or two pieces of zwieback;\\r\\none or two tablespoonfuls of prune pulp, or baked apple and water, but no\\r\\nmilk.\\r\\n\\r\\n6:00 p. m.--Farina, cream of wheat, or arrow-root well cooked with milk,\\r\\nsalt, but no sugar; or milk or stale bread and milk.\\r\\n\\r\\n10:00 p. m.--If required, ten to twelve ounces of pure milk.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat fruits may I give during this period? If the child has a weak\\r\\nstomach, only the fruit juices mentioned, but strong children may have in\\r\\naddition, baked apple, apple-sauce and prune pulp. Stew the dried prunes\\r\\nwithout sugar until they are very soft, and put all the fruit through a\\r\\nstrainer thus removing all the skin; you may give one to two\\r\\ntablespoonfuls of this at one time. No cream should be given with the\\r\\nbaked apple, and very little sugar with the apple-sauce These are very\\r\\ngood for constipation, Remember to give water freely between the feedings,\\r\\nespecially in warm weather. From one to three ounces may be given at one\\r\\ntime either with a spoon, glass or bottle. Boil the water daily and cool.\\r\\nDo not allow it to stand in the room, but give fresh water to the child\\r\\neach time.\\r\\n\\r\\n[598  MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nSCHEDULE FOR THREE-YEAR-OLD CHILD.\\r\\n\\r\\n7:30 a. m.--Cereal well cooked (over night) or at least for three hours, A\\r\\nlarger variety of food can now be given and given as before with thin\\r\\ncream, salt, but little sugar. One glass of warm milk, a soft boiled,\\r\\ncoddled or poached egg; bread very stale or dry, one slice with butter.\\r\\n\\r\\n10:00 a. m.--One cup of warm milk, with a cracker or a piece of stale\\r\\nbread and butter.\\r\\n\\r\\n2:00 p. m.--Soup, four ounces, or two ounces of beef juice. Meat: chop,\\r\\nsteak, roast beef, lamb or chicken; white potato, baked or boiled rice.\\r\\nGreen vegetables: Tips of asparagus, string beans, peas, spinach, all\\r\\ncooked until they are very soft, mashed or preferably put through a sieve,\\r\\nand only one to two teaspoonfuls at first. Desserts: Cooked fruit, baked\\r\\nor stewed apple, stewed prunes, water, but no milk.\\r\\n\\r\\n6:00 p. m.--Cereal: Farina, cream of wheat, or arrow-root, cooked for at\\r\\nleast one-half hour with plenty of salt, but no sugar; or milk toast; or\\r\\nold bread and milk or stale or dry bread and butter and a glass of milk.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBABY\\'S SECOND SUMMER.\\r\\n\\r\\nNearly all mothers dread baby\\'s second summer. If the baby is born at such\\r\\na time that he cuts his double teeth during the hot weather, and if it is\\r\\nattended by indigestion and fever, there is really some cause for worry,\\r\\nbecause the digestive organs during the hot weather are more difficult to\\r\\nmanage than during the colder months; otherwise, if you feed your baby\\r\\ncarefully and properly, and with the regularity that you did in the early\\r\\nmonths, there is no reason to dread the second summer, Mistakes are made\\r\\nby mothers and grandparents especially. They permit the child to come to\\r\\nthe table and eat of the food prepared for adults. Sometimes it is only a\\r\\nlittle, but that little will gradually grow larger; and even that little\\r\\nmay be enough to upset baby for weeks and then the illness that follows is\\r\\nin reality due to the parents\\' own foolishness when it is laid to the\\r\\ncredit of the second summer, or regarded as \"a mysterious dispensation of\\r\\nProvidence.\" Do not give anything to baby between its regular meals but\\r\\nwater; crackers, zwieback, and bread are prohibited between.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDIET OF OLDER CHILDREN-FOURTH TO TENTH YEAR.\\r\\n\\r\\nGive the largest meal at midday and a light supper at night, very much\\r\\nlike that recommended for the third year. For a few years you can give\\r\\nmilk once between breakfast and dinner, or dinner and supper, and permit\\r\\nno other food between meals, but give water freely.\\r\\n\\r\\n[ALL ABOUT BABY 599]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMILK AND CREAM.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat part of the diet should milk form now? Nothing can take its place,\\r\\nand it should be an important part of the diet. Most children can take and\\r\\ndigest milk.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy is this of so much advantage? Because it possesses a higher nutritive\\r\\nvalue than any other food, for the amount of work required of the\\r\\ndigestive organs, and it is very especially adapted to a child\\'s diet. It\\r\\nmust be clean and fresh and not too rich.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat essential point should I consider in its use? The Jersey cow gives\\r\\ntoo rich milk, and it must be greatly diluted. Children who digest milk\\r\\nwith difficulty should take it diluted about four parts milk, one part\\r\\nwater, a little salt or bicarbonate of soda should be added. Do not give\\r\\nmilk at meals when fruits, especially if they are sour, are allowed.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow much milk can I allow to advantage? For an average child with good\\r\\ndigestion, you can allow one and one-half pints to one quart daily,\\r\\nincluding what is also used upon cereals and in other ways. Two quarts are\\r\\ntoo much, for a mixed diet will do better.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow much cream can I allow? Older children do not need so much fat as do\\r\\ninfants, and cream, especially when very rich, often produces indigestion.\\r\\nIt is a common cause of the coated tongue, foul breath, and pale greasy\\r\\nstools, or biliousness so-called. Will not cream overcome constipation? It\\r\\ndoes so in some degree in infants, but not so much so in older children;\\r\\nand if it produces the above given symptoms it should not be given.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEGGS.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat is the value of eggs in the diet of this period? They form a very\\r\\nvaluable food. They must be fresh and only slightly cooked, being either\\r\\nsoft-boiled, poached or coddled. Fried eggs and omelets are prohibited.\\r\\n\\r\\nIs the white or yolk more digestible? Generally the white in most\\r\\nchildren. This is a very digestible proteid and can be used to great\\r\\nadvantage even in the latter part of the first year.\\r\\n\\r\\nDo eggs often cause biliousness? Very seldom if they are carefully\\r\\nprepared and fed.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow often may I give eggs to the child? Most children at this period will\\r\\nbe able to take one egg for breakfast and one for supper, with relish and\\r\\nadvantage; however, some few children cannot eat them at all.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMEAT AND FISH.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat kinds of meat can I give to my child? Beefsteak, mutton-chop, roast\\r\\nbeef, lamb, boiled chicken and fish, such as shad or bass.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat points should I consider in feeding meat? Most meats should be rare,\\r\\nscraped or finely divided, as a child will not chew it properly. Boiled or\\r\\nroast beef is best; fried meats should not be given to a child.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow often can I give meats? Only at the midday meal, at this period.\\r\\n\\r\\nDo you think it causes nervousness in children? Not unless too much is\\r\\ngiven and too often.\\r\\n\\r\\n[600 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat meats should be forbidden? Ham, bacon, sausage, pork, liver, kidney,\\r\\nand all dried and salt meats; also mackerel, cod and shell fish. A child\\r\\nshould not eat any of these until after the tenth year.\\r\\n\\r\\nAre gravies healthy and nutritious? Beef juice or so-called \"platter\\r\\ngravy\" from a roast is very nourishing and desirable, but many of the\\r\\ngravies that are thickened are harder to digest and too much is given.\\r\\nOnly a small quantity should be allowed.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat about vegetables? Baked, boiled or mashed potatoes may be given\\r\\nfirst, but never fried. After the sixth or seventh year baked sweet\\r\\npotato, turnips, boiled onions and cauliflower, all well cooked, may be\\r\\ngiven moderately. They must be thoroughly cooked and mashed. This is the\\r\\ngreat trouble.\\r\\n\\r\\nCan I give canned vegetables? Peas, and asparagus of the best brands can\\r\\nbe used. They are often better than stale green vegetables.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat vegetables should be prohibited? Any that are eaten raw such as\\r\\ncelery, radishes, onions, cucumbers, tomatoes or lettuce; corn, lima\\r\\nbeans, cabbage, egg plant, even when well cooked; none of these should be\\r\\ngiven to a child under ten years old.\\r\\n\\r\\nCan I give vegetable salads? As a rule none should be allowed at this\\r\\nperiod. They are difficult to digest and create great disturbances in\\r\\nchildren of all ages.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCEREALS.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat points should I consider in selecting and preparing these? They must\\r\\nbe properly cooked and not used in excess. He should not make a meal of\\r\\nthem because he is fond of them, and eat two or three saucerfuls at once.\\r\\nProper cooking is essential. Oatmeal, hominy, rice, wheaten grits need two\\r\\nhours\\' cooking at least, in a double boiler; cornstarch, arrow-root, and\\r\\nbarley should be cooked twenty minutes or more. All the market\\r\\npreparations need cooking.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow should they be eaten? Usually with milk or milk and cream; plenty of\\r\\nsalt, no sugar or very little--one-half teaspoonful to a saucer--syrups or\\r\\nbutter and sugar are prohibited.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat broths and soup do you recommend? Meat broths are generally to be\\r\\npreferred to vegetable broths, mutton and chicken usually being the best\\r\\nliked. Almost all plain broths can be given. Those thickened with rice,\\r\\nbarley or cornstarch make a good variety, especially with milk added.\\r\\nTomato soup should not be given to young children.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBREAD, CRACKERS, AND CHEESE.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat forms of bread can I give? Stale bread cut thin and freshly dried in\\r\\nthe oven until it is crisp is very useful, also the unsweetened zwieback.\\r\\nFresh bread should not be eaten. Gluten, oatmeal, or graham crackers, or\\r\\nthe Huntley and Palmer breakfast biscuits, stale rolls or corn bread which\\r\\nhas been cut in two or toasted or dried to a crisp form a sufficient\\r\\nvariety.\\r\\n\\r\\n[ALL ABOUT BABY 601]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat kinds of breadstuffs should be prohibited? All hot breads, all fresh\\r\\nrolls, buckwheat and other griddle cakes, all fresh sweet cakes,\\r\\nespecially when covered with icing and those containing any dried fruits.\\r\\nLady finger (stale) or a piece of sponge cake is all that can be allowed\\r\\nto children up to seven or eight years old.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDESSERTS.\\r\\n\\r\\nCan I give any desserts to young children? Mistakes are very often made\\r\\nhere. Junket, plain rice pudding without raisins, plain custard, and not\\r\\nmore than once a week, a small amount of ice cream are all that can be\\r\\nallowed up to six or seven years.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat are prohibited? Pies, tarts, and pastry of every kind and jams,\\r\\nsyrups, and preserved fruits; nut candy and dried fruits.\\r\\n\\r\\nCan I give a little? No, for it develops a taste for this sort of food,\\r\\nand then the plainer food is taken with less relish. The little is soon\\r\\nlikely to become a great deal.\\r\\n\\r\\nA child has an instinctive desire for sweets, why not satisfy it? A\\r\\nchild\\'s fondness for sweets is not a normal instinct. A free indulgence in\\r\\ndesserts and sweets by young children produces more digestive disorders\\r\\nthan any other causes. It is a growing tendency and hard to control as the\\r\\nchild grows older. The only safe rule is to give none in early childhood.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFRUITS.\\r\\n\\r\\nAre fruits an important or essential part of children\\'s diet? Very\\r\\nimportant, and they should be begun young. They have a splendid effect\\r\\nupon the bowels. They should be carefully selected, especially in large\\r\\ncities. A greater latitude can be all owed in the country where fruit is\\r\\nfresh.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat fruit can I safely give to children up to five years? Generally only\\r\\ncooked fruits and fresh fruit juices.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat kind of fruit juices can I use? That from fresh, sweet oranges is\\r\\nbest. The fresh juice of grape fruit, peaches, strawberries, and\\r\\nraspberries may also be used.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat stewed fruits may I use? Stewed and baked apples, prunes, pears,\\r\\npeaches and apricots.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat raw fruits should be avoided? The pulp of oranges or grape fruit,\\r\\nalso cherries, berries, bananas and pineapple.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat care should be exercised in regard to the use of fruits? In hot\\r\\nweather they should be used with greater care, and in children who are\\r\\neasily attacked with intestinal indigestion.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat symptoms suggest that I should avoid fruits? Looseness of the bowels\\r\\nor a tendency thereto, with discharge of mucus, or frequent attacks of\\r\\ncolic (abdominal pain) or stomach-ache.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt what meals should fruits be used? If the fruit juice is given upon an\\r\\nempty stomach early in the morning, it works more actively upon the\\r\\nbowels, than when given later.\\r\\n\\r\\n[602 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nIs it wise to give cream or milk with sour fruits? No, it is not wise, it\\r\\nis best to give it at midday when no milk is taken as a dessert. The\\r\\nquantity should always be moderate.\\r\\n\\r\\nCan I give anything besides water and milk to drink? Cocoa, if made very\\r\\nweak, almost all milk is often useful as a hot drink. Tea, coffee, wine,\\r\\nbeer and cider are all prohibited under puberty. Lemonade and soda water\\r\\nshould not be given until the tenth year at least.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nINDIGESTION IN OLDER CHILDREN.\\r\\n\\r\\nDifferent ways in which indigestion shows itself in children? First as an\\r\\nacute attack which lasts for a few days only; second, as chronic\\r\\ndisturbances which may last for weeks and months.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhich is the most serious? Chronic indigestion, for it often goes on for\\r\\nmonths and even years unchecked, because it is not recognized.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe symptoms of acute indigestion? Vomiting, pain, diarrhea of undigested\\r\\nfood, often fever and prostration.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat are the common causes? Over eating or indulging in improper food or\\r\\ntoo hearty eating when very tired.\\r\\n\\r\\nIs it sometimes the forerunner of some acute general sickness? Yes.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow shall I treat acute indigestion? Give castor oil to clean out all\\r\\nundigested food from the bowels. Vomiting usually frees the stomach of\\r\\nfood; stop food for from twelve to thirty-six hours, only boiled water\\r\\nbeing allowed. Let the stomach rest.\\r\\n\\r\\nCan I then begin with the former diet? No, give at first only broth gruel,\\r\\nvery much diluted milk or whey. Increase the diet slowly as the appetite\\r\\nand digestion improve, but this should consume a week or ten days in most\\r\\ncases before the full diet is resumed.\\r\\n\\r\\nGive the symptoms of chronic indigestion (dyspepsia) in children?\\r\\nDisturbed sleep, tired, grinding teeth, fretfulness, loss of weight and\\r\\nflesh, gas in the stomach and bowels, pain in the bowels, bloated bowels,\\r\\nconstipation or loose bowels with mucus in the stools, foul breath, coated\\r\\ntongue, poor appetite, capricious appetite. Some may think worms are\\r\\npresent.\\r\\n\\r\\nCommon causes of chronic constipation? Bad system of feeding, prolonged\\r\\nuse of improper food or improper methods of feeding, such as coaxing the\\r\\nchild to eat, rapid eating, eating between meals, child selects his own\\r\\nfood and lives largely upon one article of diet; indulgence in sweets,\\r\\ndesserts, pies, etc. Improperly cooked foods especially oatmeal, and\\r\\nvegetables and eating sour or stale fruits. Exclude articles of diet which\\r\\nare known to be hard for children to digest.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow shall chronic indigestion be treated? Remove all causes such as bad\\r\\nfoods, habits, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nIs it curable? In most cases, but the rules for feeding must be carefully\\r\\nfollowed for a long period. Medicine will not cure such cases unless the\\r\\nproper food is given in a proper way. That is better than medicine.\\r\\n\\r\\n[ALL ABOUT BABY 603]\\r\\n\\r\\nHow long must this proper feeding continue? For months, and with many\\r\\nchildren for two or three years.\\r\\n\\r\\nIs medicine of any use? It will relieve the symptoms, but the main thing\\r\\nis proper feeding.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSLEEP.\\r\\n\\r\\nShould a baby sleep with anyone? No, young infants have been smothered by\\r\\ntheir mothers. It is also a frequent temptation to nursing at night, and\\r\\nthis is injurious to both mother and child.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow long does baby usually sleep at first? About nine-tenths of the time.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow should his bed be prepared? The mattress should be firm and soft, the\\r\\npillow, of hair and very thin; you should change his position so as not to\\r\\nsleep always in the same position.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow many hours should baby sleep at six months? About two-thirds of the\\r\\ntime.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow long should the daily nap be continued? Until about four years old.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow shall I put baby to sleep? Darken the room and have quiet. The child\\'s\\r\\nhunger should be satisfied and make him generally comfortable and lay him\\r\\nin the crib while still awake.\\r\\n\\r\\nCan I rock him to sleep? No. It is a bad habit and, he will readily\\r\\nacquire it. It will be hard to break, and besides it is useless and some\\r\\ntimes an injurious one. The same may be said of sucking a rubber nipple or\\r\\npacifier, and all other devices to put baby to sleep.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat principal things disturb baby\\'s sleep? Quiet, peaceful sleep is a\\r\\nsign of perfect health, and disorders of sleep may be produced by almost\\r\\nanything that is wrong with the child. Food and feeding cause disturbed\\r\\nsleep. It may come from chronic indigestion due to improper food. In\\r\\nbottle-fed babies it is often due to over-feeding. In those who nurse it\\r\\nmay be due to poor food and hunger. Feeding three or four times during the\\r\\nnight makes a restless baby. It may also be due to nervous causes such as\\r\\nbad habits due to faulty training, as when the nursery is light and the\\r\\nbaby is taken from its crib whenever it cries or wakes, or when\\r\\ncontrivances for producing sleep have been used. Any excitement in a\\r\\nnursing mother or child before sleeping time will cause wakefulness.\\r\\nRomping play just before bedtime and fears aroused by stories and pictures\\r\\nare causes, and children who inherit a nervous constitution are special\\r\\nsufferers from this cause. Cold feet, insufficient or too much clothing,\\r\\nwant of pure fresh air in the sleeping room. Tonsils or adenoids may\\r\\ninterfere with breathing in older children. Rousing a sleeping child from\\r\\na good sound sleep, is a frequent cause of poor sleep. If a pregnant woman\\r\\nkeeps herself in as good condition as possible, not only physically, but\\r\\nalso mentally, she will not be likely to have a nervous baby; and if a\\r\\nbaby is not born nervous there is no reason, at all, why it should not\\r\\nsleep well, for sleep is then its most normal condition, nine-tenths of\\r\\nthe time. It will then depend upon the food and training it is given. The\\r\\ntraining many babies receive is enough to make them poor sleepers.\\r\\n\\r\\n[604 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES ]\\r\\n\\r\\nUnnecessary handling.--Babies are wakened from sleep to show to friends\\r\\nwho wish to see them at almost any and all hours. They are handled,\\r\\npetted, and made restless. Sleep is their normal condition and they ought\\r\\nto be given the opportunity nature demands. They are only to be aroused\\r\\nfrom sleep for nurse, bathing and clothing, and immediately placed in\\r\\ntheir crib, covered comfortably and warmly with all light shut away from\\r\\ntheir eyes and quiet about them. They will soon wake of their own accord\\r\\nfor meals.\\r\\n\\r\\nRocking baby.--Rocking and shaking cause an increased flow of blood to the\\r\\nbrain, and this should be avoided, for it of itself will cause\\r\\nsleeplessness. The brain during sleep is comparatively empty of blood;\\r\\nwarm feet and cool head tend to produce sleep. Rocking, etc., is\\r\\nunnatural, and baby is made to receive and enjoy the natural. If the baby\\r\\nis sick the mother may take it in her arms and sing to it and coddle it\\r\\ncarefully, but it is then sick. If it is trained properly from the\\r\\nbeginning, rocking to sleep will be unnecessary; walking with the baby is\\r\\nof the same nature. See that your baby has warm feet and legs and body and\\r\\na cool head, with comfortable clothes and good careful feeding, and it\\r\\nwill sleep. Singing lullabies are soothing, but they do no good at first\\r\\nas the baby is deaf. Such lullabies are good when baby is sick and\\r\\nnervous, and then the mother is allowed and expected to hold and quiet\\r\\nbaby. Sleep perhaps as much or more than any other item of nursery regime,\\r\\ndepends on habit and mild but decided purpose. A lack of firmness in the\\r\\nearly months of the baby\\'s life may not only render its early years a\\r\\nburden to itself, but an annoyance, if not a nuisance to the entire\\r\\nhousehold. Baby\\'s habits are quickly and easily formed, but hard to\\r\\ncorrect. Dr. Tooker says: \"An infant is as plastic as moist clay, you can\\r\\nmold it to your will. But you must have a will and a purpose and a plan,\\r\\nand make your judgment and your duty law.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut suppose baby will not sleep, but continues cross and wakeful and\\r\\npeevish; can I not give medicines to produce sleep? Never. If baby is\\r\\nwakeful and refuses to sleep, there is something wrong with your training,\\r\\nhis clothing, covering, or his food, or he may be sick, he may not get\\r\\nenough food, etc., or he may have worms. If everything is all right and\\r\\nyou have trained your baby right from his birth, he will sleep. Find out\\r\\nthe cause and remove it. All soothing syrups, cordials, and quieting\\r\\nmedicines contain opium in some form, and all experienced physicians\\r\\nrealize the danger of giving these mixtures to babies. Babies have been\\r\\nkilled by medicines which were declared to contain neither opium nor\\r\\nanything else injurious. They are often used. Remember that opium,\\r\\nlaudanum and paregoric are dangerous for babies and old people. Careful\\r\\nproper training, allowing plenty of sleeping time, no waking at wrong\\r\\nhours, warm feet, legs and body, cool head, proper modified food, and\\r\\nespecially mother nursing, with mother careful with herself, will give a\\r\\ngood baby in nine out of ten cases.\\r\\n\\r\\nWill children ever sleep too much? Not if they are healthy; you must\\r\\nremember a newly-born baby sleeps nine-tenths of the time; excessive\\r\\nsleeping may indicate disease of the brain.\\r\\n\\r\\n[ALL ABOUT BABY 605 ]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEXERCISE.\\r\\n\\r\\nIs exercise necessary for infants? Yes.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow can it be obtained? A young baby usually gets its exercise by\\r\\nscreaming, waving its arms, kicking, etc. It is a good plan to let baby\\r\\nlie in the center of a large bed, and with his long skirts drawn up, allow\\r\\nhim to kick his little legs about for twenty or twenty-five minutes twice\\r\\neach day or one-half hour once a day. His clothing ought to be loose for\\r\\nthis exercise. If the room is all right you can remove all clothing except\\r\\nhis shirt, stockings and napkin; change his position sometimes and let him\\r\\nlie on his stomach for awhile. Of course this exercise cannot be taken\\r\\nafter a meal and before the fourth month. Take a large clothes basket, put\\r\\na blanket and some large pillows in it and prop baby up in a half sitting\\r\\nposition for a little while each day, beginning with fifteen minutes, then\\r\\none-half hour, and you can also at this time (fourth month) play with baby\\r\\nfor a short time every day, but never just before bedtime, and the best\\r\\ntime is just after his morning nap. Do not toss him in the air to make him\\r\\nlaugh or crow; he is too tender and delicate for that. When baby is older\\r\\nand in short clothes, place a thick quilt upon the floor and allow him to\\r\\ntumble as he will; a fence two feet high which surrounds a mattress, makes\\r\\nan excellent place, or a box for this young animal to exercise his arms\\r\\nand legs without danger of injury. Before you put baby to sleep at night\\r\\ngive him a warm sponge bath with a fresh band and shirt and he will sleep.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen, if ever, is crying useful in a baby? The cry expands the lungs of a\\r\\nnew-born baby, and he should use his lungs a few minutes daily in order to\\r\\nkeep them well expanded.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow much crying daily is necessary? Twenty to thirty minutes is not too\\r\\nmuch.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat kind of a cry is it? Loud and strong and infants get red in the face\\r\\nwith it. Some call it a scream. It is exercise for baby and necessary for\\r\\nits health.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen is the cry abnormal? When it is very long and too frequent. It is not\\r\\nstrong, but rather of a moaning or worrying nature or only a whine.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat causes such crying? Habit, temper, pain, hunger, illness.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat is the indulgence or habit cry? This is the cry of infants who cry to\\r\\nbe rocked, or carried about, for a bottle to suck, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\n[606 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nTemper cry? This is loud and strong and is usually accompanied by kicking,\\r\\nstiffening of the body, bending backward and is usually quite violent.\\r\\n\\r\\nPain cry? This is generally strong, sharp and quick, but not usually\\r\\ncontinuous, the features contract, legs draw up and the baby plainly shows\\r\\nsymptoms of distress,\\r\\n\\r\\nHunger cry? This is a continuous fretful, pitiful cry, not strong and\\r\\nlusty,--baby looks hungry.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cry of illness? This is moaning, fretful, easily aroused to crying.\\r\\nThis can be distinguished even from a little distance before seeing baby,\\r\\nif you have heard it once. A baby who cries to get things stops when he\\r\\ngets them.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf baby cries at night what shall I do? See that he is comfortable,\\r\\nclothing all smooth under and about him, with warm feet and hands, and\\r\\nclean unsoiled napkin. If he is all right, let him cry. If it is habitual,\\r\\nfind out the cause.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf baby cries from temper or habit what shall I do? Let him cry it out,\\r\\nyou must conquer him or he will make of your life a burden. Be sure first\\r\\nit is habit or temper and then conquer him. I have seen many babies who\\r\\ncried from cause and I have also seen those who needed conquering.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut will not crying cause rupture? Not in young infants if the band is\\r\\nproperly applied and not under any conditions after one year.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHOW TO LIFT A CHILD.\\r\\n\\r\\nGrasp the clothing below the feet with the right hand and slip the left\\r\\nhand and, arm beneath the infant\\'s body to its head. It is then raised\\r\\nupon the left arm and its head is upon your arm or chest. This supports\\r\\nthe entire spine and there is no undue pressure upon the chest or abdomen,\\r\\nas is often the case when baby is grasped around the body or under the\\r\\narms.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow shall I lift a child who is old enough to run about? Place your hands\\r\\nunder the child\\'s arms, at the arm-pits and never by the wrists.\\r\\n\\r\\nCan I injure the child lifting it by its hands or wrists? Yes, it often\\r\\ninjures the elbows or shoulder joints.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTEMPERATURE.\\r\\n\\r\\nNormal temperature of an infant? This varies more than it does in adults.\\r\\nIn the rectum it varies from 98 degrees F. to 99.5 degrees F., and a\\r\\ntemperature in the rectum of 98 degrees F. or of 100 degrees F. is not of\\r\\nmuch importance unless it continues.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhere should I take the temperature of infants and young children? First\\r\\nthe rectum, next the groin, the first is from one-half a degree to a\\r\\ndegree higher than that of the groin.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow long should the thermometer be left in place? Two minutes in the\\r\\nrectum and five minutes in the groin.\\r\\n\\r\\n[ALL ABOUT BABY 607]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat meaning has the different temperature in a young child? 100 degrees\\r\\nF. to 102 degrees F. means a mild illness.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne hundred four degrees F. or over means a serious illness. The duration\\r\\nof the fever is more important. Slight causes often produce a high\\r\\ntemperature in all young children which lasts for a few hours. There is\\r\\nthen not much cause for alarm unless the temperature continues high or is\\r\\naccompanied by important symptoms of illness.\\r\\n\\r\\nIs high temperature a more serious symptom in a young child than in an\\r\\nadult? No, for young children are very sensitive to conditions which\\r\\nproduce fever and the thermometer often gives an unduly high idea of the\\r\\nseverity of the symptoms. The same cause which would produce a temperature\\r\\nin an adult of 102 degrees F. or 103 degrees F. would likely produce a\\r\\ntemperature of 104 degrees or 105 degrees F. in a child.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNERVOUSNESS.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat are the principal causes of nervousness in young infants and in\\r\\nchildren? The brain is a delicate structure at this time, and it grows\\r\\nrapidly, and during the first year of life grows as much as during all the\\r\\nrest of life. This needs quiet and peaceful surroundings and infants who\\r\\nare naturally nervous should be left almost alone, and few people should\\r\\nsee them. Such babies should not play much. The poor little baby is often\\r\\nso tried by the attentions given him by older people that he does not know\\r\\nwhat to do, and as one author, a lady, says: \"If he could speak he would\\r\\nbeg for a quiet hour, and be perfectly happy if left alone with his own\\r\\nlittle hands and toes for his sole amusement.\" Babies of the very poor are\\r\\nless nervous than those of the wealthy and this is generally due to the\\r\\nfact that their mothers are too busy to constantly entertain and bother\\r\\nthem. Children are better companions for babies than adults. Such little\\r\\nattentions given by the parents and relatives make sleepless and nervous\\r\\nbabies very often. Playing with them before time and out of season, makes\\r\\nthem not only nervous and irritable, but causes indigestion and allied\\r\\ndiseases.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTOYS.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is instinct for baby to put everything in its mouth. However, toys\\r\\nshould be chosen that are smooth, easily washed and which cannot be\\r\\nswallowed. Avoid toys with sharp points like corners, or loose parts,\\r\\nsmall objects that can be pushed into the nose or ear or swallowed, such\\r\\nas coins, marbles, buttons, safety pins, beads, painted toys and those\\r\\ncovered with hair or wool. Infants frequently swallow such wool or hair.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nKISSING.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat objections are there to kissing babies? They are many and serious. No\\r\\none, at least, outside of the immediate family has any right to kiss baby.\\r\\nTuberculosis, diphtheria, syphilis and many other diseases are given by\\r\\nkissing. If infants are kissed at all, they should be kissed upon the\\r\\ncheek or forehead.\\r\\n\\r\\n[608 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFOREIGN BODIES.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf in the throat, examine and remove with the finger. If it has gone into\\r\\nthe stomach, give plenty of dry food, such as bread, potatoes, but do not\\r\\ngive an emetic or cathartic. An infant should have its usual food. A\\r\\ncathartic would hurry the foreign body too rapidly through the intestines,\\r\\nand in this way do harm. In the usual way it becomes coated with fecal\\r\\nmatter and usually passes the intestines without causing any injury.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat shall I do if it is in the ears? If you can easily remove it with\\r\\nyour fingers or small hair pin or crochet hook, do it. If not, take the\\r\\nbaby to a physician. If it is a corn, bean or pea, do not wet it, or it\\r\\nwill swell and become larger.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat if it is in the nostril? Place baby upon the table with its face\\r\\ntoward a good light and use a hair pin bent right and pass this slowly and\\r\\ncarefully behind the object, and pull slowly forward; or compress the\\r\\nempty nostril and have the child blow the nose strongly. If not removed\\r\\neasily, see a physician.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCOLIC.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a very common disturbance in children, and is always due to\\r\\ndisturbed digestion. It occurs in both nursed and bottle-fed babies, and\\r\\nmay appear in the healthiest baby from error in the last meal, or error of\\r\\ndiet or habit in the mother. Some mothers cannot under any circumstances\\r\\nsecrete good nourishing milk, suitable for their children, and continued\\r\\nstomach and bowel disturbances with colic and emaciation follow its use.\\r\\nSuch mothers should not nurse their baby.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat are the causes of colic? As before stated, it is due to indigestion\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat causes indigestion? In nursing babies this may be due to some\\r\\nirregularity in the health or habits of the mother, or change in her\\r\\ndieting, and if the colic is not persistent the cause is not hard to find.\\r\\nWorry, trouble, sorrow, anger, overwork, and errors of diet in the mother\\r\\noften cause this trouble or the child may nurse too fast, too long, too\\r\\nmuch, or too often, or the milk may be too rich. If so, give baby an ounce\\r\\nof hot water before nursing. Hand-fed children are too often over-fed, and\\r\\nthis produces indigestion.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat are the symptoms of colic? The child screams sharply; the cry comes\\r\\nsuddenly and returns every few minutes; he draws up his legs and feet; the\\r\\nmuscles of his face contract and he has other signs of pain. The belly is\\r\\nusually hard and tense.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat can I do for colic? First warm his feet and hands by placing them\\r\\nagainst a hot-water bag, or holding them before the open fire, turn him on\\r\\nhis stomach, letting him lie on a hot-water bag or hot piece of flannel;\\r\\npat his back gently to help up the wind and give him a little hot water\\r\\nwith a medicine dropper and a few drops of essence of peppermint may be\\r\\nadded to the water. If the colic continues, put ten drops of turpentine\\r\\ninto a half teacupful of warm water, and inject this slowly into the\\r\\nrectum, and at the same time gently rub the abdomen so as to start the\\r\\nwind. If the wind is in the stomach, give him one-half a soda mint tablet\\r\\ndissolved in a tablespoonful of very warm water, or a little soda. If the\\r\\nattacks are frequent, the foods are too strong; use less cream or milk and\\r\\nmore water. Regulate the mother\\'s diet carefully if the baby nurses, and\\r\\nshe should take some exercise out of doors, if possible, and try not to be\\r\\nnervous. Cereals, cocoa, milk, eggs, gruels made of corn, oatmeal; most\\r\\nfruits, not tart, and vegetables, with some meat, make a good diet for a\\r\\nnursing mother. The bowels must move freely every day at least once.\\r\\n\\r\\n[ALL ABOUT BABY 609]\\r\\n\\r\\nMOTHERS\\' REMEDIES.--1. Wind Colic, Yarrow Tea for.--\"Steep the yarrow tea\\r\\nthe same as for catnip tea or any ordinary herb, and give as often as\\r\\nnecessary.\" This is a remedy that has been very much used, and will help\\r\\nin a great many cases. It is perfectly harmless, and no one need have any\\r\\nfear of trying it.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Colic, Camphor Cure for.--\"One drop of camphor in a teaspoonful of\\r\\nwater. This remedy worked like a charm with my little girl.\" This acts\\r\\nquickly, and is sure to give relief as it warms up the stomach.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Wind Colic, Castor Oil for.--\"Give large doses of castor oil.\" Colic,\\r\\nas we all know, is frequently caused by fermentation of the food in the\\r\\nstomach and bowels, and castor oil is one of the best known cathartics in\\r\\na case of this kind. This can be given to small babies, in small\\r\\nquantities of course.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Wind Colic.--A New York mother sends in the following relief\\r\\nfor:--\"Give enough essence of wintergreen in water to make it taste for a\\r\\nsmall babe, and more according to age. For mine I give 1/4 to 1/2, cup of\\r\\nwarm sweetened water. I have always used this remedy, as it was\\r\\nrecommended to me by my mother. It is better than peppermint as it is not\\r\\nso binding.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n5. Wind Colic, a Good Herb Remedy for.--Add enough water to one ounce of\\r\\nsnake root to make one-half pint.\" Give in doses according to the age of\\r\\nthe child. This is a good remedy, and has been used by many mothers with\\r\\ngood success.\\r\\n\\r\\n6. Wind Colic.--A doctor in New York sends in the following remedy\\r\\nfor.--\"One-half teaspoonful sweet spirits of nitre in one-third glass of\\r\\nwater, for baby. Increase the dose for older children or adults. This\\r\\nwarms the stomach, and is highly recommended.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n7. Wind Colic, Cloves for.--\"Make an infusion of 1 or 2 ounces of cloves.\\r\\nCloves are warming, cordial and strengthening; they expel wind, and are\\r\\ngood for the colic.\" This treatment has been known to give many a fretful\\r\\nbaby a good night\\'s sleep, and will be found very useful in homes where\\r\\nbabies have this disease.\\r\\n\\r\\n[610 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nPHYSICIANS\\' TREATMENT.--Temporary relief is obtained in attacks of colic\\r\\nby emptying the bowels of irritating materials, either by an enema or\\r\\nmedicine. Peppermint, anise seed, catnip are effective, but may be harmful\\r\\nif continued long. Gin and whisky, warm, are good when the gas is in the\\r\\nstomach and upper bowel. It is always best to mix them with a solution\\r\\nlike the following:\\r\\n\\r\\n    Bicarbonate of soda               40 grains\\r\\n    Aromatic spirits of ammonia       30 drops\\r\\n    Enough peppermint water to make    2 ounces\\r\\n\\r\\nPut one teaspoonful in a cup of hot water for a child one year old.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following is good to move the bowels:\\r\\n\\r\\n      Bicarbonate of soda         40 grains\\r\\n      Aromatic syrup of rhubarb    4 drams\\r\\n      Syrup of senna               5 drams\\r\\n      Syrup of orange              1 ounce\\r\\n\\r\\nOne teaspoonful two or three times daily is needed in sour gassy stomach,\\r\\nwith constipation or foul smelling stools. Fortunately such medicine is\\r\\nnot often needed if the mother is careful, or baby is carefully\\r\\nbottle-fed. When there is vomiting with the colic and the stools contain\\r\\ncurds the food is too strong. The nursing baby should be given one ounce\\r\\nof warm water before nursing, and the food for the bottle-fed baby should\\r\\nbe made weaker by going back one formula. Sometimes peptonizing the food\\r\\nfor a short time will do. This is very good when the proteids (curds) are\\r\\nhard for the baby to digest.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEARACHE.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany young babies suffer from this trouble without the cause being even\\r\\nsuspected. It may come after a cold, an attack of bronchitis or pneumonia,\\r\\nand sometimes during teething. It often accompanies scarlet fever and\\r\\nmeasles. The child screams, presses his head against his mother or nurse,\\r\\npulls at his ear as if it hurt him. If you press in front of the ear the\\r\\nbaby jumps as if in great pain and cries aloud. The pain is likely to be\\r\\ncontinuous and prolonged.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat can I do for it? Heat is the best remedy. Wash out the ear with a hot\\r\\nsolution of boric acid fifteen to twenty grains to the ounce of water, and\\r\\nthen apply heat in various ways. Have the child lie with the painful ear\\r\\nagainst a covered hot water bag or heat a flannel over a lamp and place it\\r\\nagainst the ear, changing it often to keep it hot. A bag of hot salt or\\r\\nbran is also very good. Laudanum and oil should not be used unless ordered\\r\\nby a physician. As soon as possible after the first attack of pain the\\r\\nbaby should be examined by a doctor and unnecessary deafness is often\\r\\navoided by such action. For a more extended account, see General\\r\\nDepartment. Fomentations applied are often beneficial, especially of hot\\r\\nwater.\\r\\n\\r\\n(See Earache, Mothers\\' Remedies, etc. under General Department).\\r\\n\\r\\n[ALL ABOUT BABY 611]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCROUP.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis disease is treated fully in the general department; only a general\\r\\noutline is given here. This is a disease dreaded by most mothers. It is\\r\\nmore distressing than dangerous. Its appearance is sudden and  generally\\r\\nat night. The baby may have had a slight cold or have been exposed to a\\r\\nbad wind or it may have come on without any known cause.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--They are known to almost everyone. There is a hard, dry,\\r\\nbarking, hoarse cough, generally with difficulty in breathing to a greater\\r\\nor less degree with a distressed look.\\r\\n\\r\\n(For Mothers\\' Remedies, see General Department.)\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--If the child has eaten a big supper, it is well to give a\\r\\nsimple emetic, such as warm mustard water, alum and molasses, or goose\\r\\ngrease, or melted lard. Wring out pieces of flannel in hot water and put\\r\\nthem on the child\\'s throat as hot as he can bear them and change them\\r\\noften to keep them hot. Make a tent by spreading a sheet over an opened\\r\\numbrella over the crib then place a croup kettle or teakettle close to the\\r\\ncrib, directing the steam under the sheet into the tent so that baby may\\r\\ninhale the vapor, taking care not to burn him. This affords much relief.\\r\\nIf necessary give ten drops of syrup of ipecac until vomiting occurs; a\\r\\nteaspoonful of castor oil should also be given and if the baby is\\r\\nconstipated, give an enema of soapsuds and water. Keep the child indoors\\r\\nthe next day.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCONSTIPATION IN BABIES.\\r\\n\\r\\nMOTHERS\\' REMEDIES.--1. Constipation, Olive Oil Treatment for.--\"Rub the\\r\\nabdomen with a firm yet gentle motion from left to right with pure olive\\r\\noil. This is what the doctor told me to do for my babe of three years.\"\\r\\nThis treatment will be found very beneficial as the olive oil is very\\r\\nstrengthening and the rubbing will always give relief.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Constipation, A Pleasant Treatment for.--\"One-half teaspoonful olive\\r\\noil, one-half teaspoonful orange juice, three times a day after feeding.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Constipation, Prunes a Medicine for.--\"Abate heat and gently open the\\r\\nbowels by the use of prunes. These should be fed to children more often.\\r\\nThis would often prevent sickness. A very useful way of administering\\r\\nprunes as a medicine is to simmer for one-half hour, a few in water enough\\r\\nto cover, with 1/2 oz. senna leaves; remove the prunes, allow to dry and\\r\\nlet the child eat them when needed. This is very good.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Constipation, Soothing Syrup Made by a Mother in New York for.--\"One-\\r\\nhalf ounce spearmint, one-quarter ounce lady\\'s slipper, one-half ounce\\r\\nrhubarb, one-quarter ounce cinnamon powder; pour one-half pint boiling\\r\\nwater on the whole, mix and let stand to boil fifteen minutes, strain and\\r\\nsweeten well with syrup or honey. Give a teaspoonful every half hour,\\r\\ndiminishing as the pain subsides.\" This will be found very beneficial in\\r\\nchildren, and may be used without any fear whatever, as it is perfectly\\r\\nharmless.\\r\\n\\r\\n5. Constipation, Figs as a Medicine for.--\"Grind up equal amounts of figs\\r\\nand senna leaves, put in closed jar and eat dry when needed.\" This will be\\r\\nfound especially good for children, and most of them like it.\\r\\n\\r\\n[612 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCONSTIPATION may be caused by many things, inheritance, malformation of\\r\\nthe rectum and other parts, errors of food in the mother and in bottle-fed\\r\\nbabies.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat is the treatment? If the baby is nursed and the mother is\\r\\nconstipated, she should at once change her habits and diet. She should\\r\\nexercise in the open air at least two hours every day, and have a movement\\r\\ndaily, even if she must take some mild laxative.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat should she drink and eat? She should drink plenty of water, and pure\\r\\nrich milk, cocoa, eat oatmeal and cornmeal gruels. She should not drink\\r\\ntea or coffee. She can eat fruit, most green vegetables and some meat, but\\r\\nnot much starchy food. Baby may not get enough residue in his bowels. Give\\r\\nhim one or two meals daily of modified milk made up of oatmeal gruel\\r\\ninstead of barley, and give him plenty of water between his meals. One\\r\\nteaspoonful of cream in a little hot water given before nursing is often\\r\\nbeneficial, or one or two teaspoonfuls of beef juice may be given night\\r\\nand morning, After six months a little orange or prune juice may be added.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBOTTLE-FED BABIES.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdd a little more top-milk or cream to each bottle than the formula gives;\\r\\ndo not pasteurize the food unless it is necessary; do not use lime-water,\\r\\nbut bicarbonate of soda in proper strength in its place, as lime-water is\\r\\noften very constipating. Malted food may be added to each bottle for some\\r\\ntime. If necessary, stimulate the rectum mildly; this can be done by\\r\\nholding the baby over a small chamber at exactly the same time after a\\r\\nmeal each day and insert into the bowel a small cone of oiled paper, or\\r\\nuse a small castile soap suppository. This may form a habit in a few days.\\r\\nSuppositories of gluten are very beneficial if used in the morning. The\\r\\nchild should not be allowed to go longer than twenty-four hours without a\\r\\npassage. A enema made up of one or two tablespoonfuls of sweet oil may be\\r\\ngiven with a bulb syringe, or an ounce of warm water to which has been\\r\\nadded one-half teaspoonful of glycerin, or one-half pint of warm\\r\\nsoap-suds. Do not give it every day; massage the baby\\'s abdomen. Your hand\\r\\nshould be warm. Begin at the right side groin and make a series of\\r\\ncircular movements with your fingers, lightly at first, and then press\\r\\ndown harder as the baby becomes accustomed to it; work your way up\\r\\ngradually to the ribs, then across to the ribs on the left side, and down\\r\\nto the left groin. This can be done twice daily for eight or ten minutes\\r\\nat a time, and always at the same time of day, but never soon after a\\r\\nmeal. Olive oil may safely be given for constipation to a baby,--from\\r\\ntwenty drops to one teaspoonful one or two times daily, but castor oil\\r\\nshould not be given for constipation, as after a time it leaves the baby\\r\\nmore constipated than ever. Sometimes inserting your finger, well oiled,\\r\\ninto the rectum, will produce a passage. For older children, decrease the\\r\\namount of white bread, toast, potatoes, and give green vegetables,\\r\\noatmeal, and graham bread instead, with plenty of proper fruit twice\\r\\ndaily; raw, scraped apples are sometimes the best fruit to use.\\r\\n\\r\\n[ALL ABOUT BABY 613]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDIARRHEA. (For Older Children).\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat shall I do for this trouble? Rid the system of the irritating matter\\r\\nby giving the baby one teaspoonful of castor oil. Then stop all solid food\\r\\nand give boiled water if there is only a moderate looseness. Keep the\\r\\nchild perfectly quiet. If the attack is more severe and attended by fever\\r\\nand vomiting all food and milk should be stopped at once in children of\\r\\nall ages, and only broth, barley water or some thin gruel given. Castor\\r\\noil is required for a severe attack. If the patient is an infant the milk\\r\\nshould be diluted or stopped. In severe attacks with vomiting or frequent\\r\\nfoul stools, stop all food for at least twelve hours and all milk for a\\r\\nlonger time, and the bowels should be freely moved by a cathartic. Give\\r\\nplenty of water to drink.\\r\\n\\r\\nFood.--Albumin water is often better than plain water or anything else. To\\r\\nmake it stir the white of an egg into a pint of cold water. See that they\\r\\nare well mixed, add a pinch of salt and strain. Give baby one teaspoonful\\r\\nevery one-half hour, and if he vomits all other food, give two ounces\\r\\nevery two hours; barley gruel, wheat flour gruel, mutton broth may be\\r\\ngiven also.\\r\\n\\r\\nMOTHERS\\' REMEDIES.--1. Inflammation of the Bowels, Poultice of Hot Mush\\r\\nfor.--\"Wrap the child in a poultice of hot mush. Place the poultice over\\r\\nthe abdomen.\" A poultice of this kind retains the heat, and is very good\\r\\nfor inflammation of the abdominal cavity, and would help to take away the\\r\\nsoreness and bloating in the bowels that is always present in this\\r\\ndisease.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Bowel Trouble, a Good Tonic for.--\\r\\n\\r\\n    Powdered rhubarb        1 heaping teaspoonful\\r\\n    Soda                  1/4 teaspoonful\\r\\n    Sugar                   1 teaspoonful\\r\\n    Peppermint essence    1/2 teaspoonful\\r\\n    Hot water             1/2 cup (scant)\\r\\n\\r\\nDose:--One-half teaspoonful every hour until bowels show signs of right\\r\\ncolor.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe soda and the peppermint will tone up the stomach and relieve any\\r\\ntrouble present there, while the rhubarb will act on the bowels and carry\\r\\noff all impurities.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Bowel Trouble, Rhubarb and Licorice for.--\"Compound tincture of rhubarb\\r\\none ounce bicarbonate of soda 1 dram, fluid extract of licorice 1 dram,\\r\\npure water 6 ounces. Give from one to two teaspoonfuls according to the\\r\\nage of the child.\" This will be found a very good treatment for this\\r\\ntrouble, and one that has been thoroughly tried.\\r\\n\\r\\n[614 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRICKETS.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou should always be suspicious if your baby has no teeth at the end of\\r\\nthe first year. A hearty baby should have six or eight, and if the soft\\r\\nspot in the head just above the forehead is as much open as it was for\\r\\nmonths previously you should be doubly suspicious. This soft spot should\\r\\nbe closed in a well-nourished infant between the fifteenth and twentieth\\r\\nmonths. If in addition to this the child sweats about the head whenever it\\r\\nsleeps, cries whenever it is handled (unless it has scurvy or rheumatism)\\r\\nand does not like to play, the indications of rickets are very nearly\\r\\nconclusive. Rickets is a constitutional disease showing itself in\\r\\ndifferent ways.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt what age does it usually occur? Between six months and two and one-half\\r\\nyears.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat are the causes of rickets? Improper food, or inability to absorb the\\r\\nfood, unhygienic conditions. Nursing babies who have a healthy mother are\\r\\nnot troubled with this disease unless she nurses too long into the second\\r\\nyear. Starchy foods, too little milk or other animal food, taking the\\r\\ninfant to the family table and allowing it to eat whatever it wants, these\\r\\nare the most common errors in baby feeding which very often result in\\r\\nrickets. Babies who are brought up on condensed milk, or other foods that\\r\\ncontain little fat are likely to have rickets. Insufficient clothing, damp\\r\\nand badly ventilated buildings, a lack of out-door air and sunshine, and\\r\\ninherited constitutional weakness, are other causes.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen do the most marked symptoms usually occur? Between the sixth or\\r\\nfifteenth months.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat are the symptoms? Such children are likely to be nervous and\\r\\nirritable; child\\'s head sweats profusely at night, so much so that the\\r\\npillows are very wet. The chest is poorly shaped and frequently has\\r\\ndepressions at the sides, and little nodules or \"beads\" in the ribs where\\r\\nthe ribs and breast-bone join. The child\\'s head is also peculiar. It is\\r\\noften very flat on the top and measures more around than a normal child at\\r\\nthe same age. The forehead stands out and the sides and top are flattened.\\r\\nThe soft spot in the skull is large and late in closing. He is late in\\r\\ncutting his teeth. His abdomen is generally large and prominent, pot\\r\\nbelly; his muscles are soft and flabby, and his wrists and ankles are\\r\\nenlarged a little later. He takes cold easily. He is pale and anemic,\\r\\nalthough he may be plump and fat, and when he begins to walk his legs bend\\r\\neasily, and he will have bow-legs. When he sits, his back will look as if\\r\\ncurved and this alarms his parents, who may think his spine is diseased.\\r\\n\\r\\nIs such a disease curable? Yes, if taken in time; you can arrest its\\r\\nprogress.\\r\\n\\r\\nDo they ever die of rickets? Very seldom, but they do not stand other\\r\\ndiseases very well.\\r\\n\\r\\n[ALL ABOUT BABY 615]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen and what shall I do for it? If you recognize the condition, have the\\r\\nbaby attended to immediately by a physician. The food should be\\r\\nchanged--such children require fats; very little starchy or sweet foods\\r\\nallowed. A baby ten to twelve months old can suck a piece of boiled bacon\\r\\nfor a few minutes every day. Fruit juices can be given early, raw meat\\r\\njuice once a day. Give him his tub bath daily, and if he is apt to take\\r\\ncold easily he should have a little cold water dashed over his chest and\\r\\nspine, followed by a gentle brisk rubbing to start up the circulation. Sun\\r\\nbaths are beneficial. Place the baby directly in the sun with his back to\\r\\nit, for an hour every day. Give him plenty of air and sunshine, both\\r\\nindoors and outdoors.\\r\\n\\r\\nMedicine.--Cod liver oil is an excellent remedy with the hypophosphites.\\r\\nCod liver oil alone with calcarea phosphoricum 3X (homeopathic) is\\r\\nsplendid treatment also. The whole treatment must be continued for\\r\\nmonths--calcarea phos. four times daily.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSCURVY.--This disease is sometimes seen in infants. It attacks infants who\\r\\nhave been fed for a long time on a proprietary food or else on milk that\\r\\nhas been over sterilized. Nursing children seldom have it, or those who\\r\\nhave been properly fed on modified cows\\' milk. Babies who are delicate and\\r\\npoorly nourished are more subject to it. The first symptoms a mother\\r\\nnotices is that it seems to hurt very much when his legs are touched;\\r\\nsometimes both hurt, and then again only one is painful; at other times\\r\\nthe arms will be most painful and again both arms and legs seem to pain\\r\\nalike. So it goes on; the joints enlarge somewhat and sometimes little red\\r\\nspots appear just under the skin and very often the gums will become red\\r\\nand spongy; this is especially noticeable around the incisor teeth of the\\r\\nupper gums, if they have already appeared. Rheumatism is very rarely seen\\r\\nso early and with that, there is generally fever.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--A cure is soon affected. Stop the patent food at once, or if\\r\\nthe milk has been sterilized, it must be discontinued and the baby put on\\r\\nunsterilized milk diluted to the proper strength for his special age.\\r\\nStrained juice of an orange should be given him every day; if under six\\r\\nmonths he can have the juice of one-half an orange; over that the juice of\\r\\none orange. This is given in intervals during the day. Beef juice is good,\\r\\nabout two ounces in twenty-four hours. Smaller amount if necessary.\\r\\nImprovement is noticed twenty-four to forty-eight hours after treatment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMALNUTRITION. (Marasmus).--Marasmus is a term applied to infants who grow\\r\\nthinner and thinner. No matter how much or little they eat there is a\\r\\nconstant wasting or fading away of the body.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat are the causes? Syphilis, tuberculosis, chronic vomiting, persistent\\r\\nloose bowels, poor assimilation of the food. Marasmus is really a later\\r\\nand more severe form of malnutrition.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms.--He looks shriveled, the skin is dry, eyes are sunken, anemia is\\r\\nmarked, the belly is much distended, while the other parts of the body\\r\\nseem to be all bones and no flesh; he is constantly whining and fretful,\\r\\nhas a tired and anxious expression most of the time; under six months it\\r\\nis hard to cure.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--A physician is needed to watch over and prescribe, no set rule\\r\\ncan be given. Sometimes cod-liver oil or iron is needed. It needs constant\\r\\ncare and watching to cure this trouble.\\r\\n\\r\\n[616 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCONVULSIONS.--Young children are more subject to convulsions than older\\r\\npeople. Convulsions may be due to brain trouble, but an overloaded stomach\\r\\nis the first thing a doctor thinks of, and so the mother should remember\\r\\nwhat was eaten that might be unusual.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst Thing for the Mother to do? Undress the baby and put him to bed in a\\r\\nquiet room, and place an ice bag on his head, or wring cloths out of ice\\r\\nwater or very cold water and place them on baby\\'s head, and change often\\r\\nto keep them cold. Warm the feet with a hot water bag. If the doctor can\\r\\nnot be present soon, give baby a mustard foot bath in bed; use two\\r\\ntablespoonfuls to a gallon of water, some advise stronger. If the\\r\\nconvulsions are severe wring towels out of mustard water and place a\\r\\nrubber sheet on the bed and wrap the child\\'s body and feet in the hot wet\\r\\ntowels until the parts are quite red, and afterward cover the body with\\r\\nwarm flannels. Have plenty of hot water ready, so the doctor can give a\\r\\nfull tub bath when he comes, if he thinks it necessary. If the child can\\r\\nswallow, give him a teaspoonful of castor oil; or if the convulsions\\r\\ncontinue, wash out the bowels or give an injection as soon as possible.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen is a hot bath needed and useful? If the convulsions have continued\\r\\nuntil the pulse is weak, the face is very pale, the nails and lips blue,\\r\\nthe feet and hands cold: it will do good by bringing the blood to the\\r\\nsurface and relieve the brain, heart and lungs.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow shall I give it? Use a thermometer to see that the temperature of the\\r\\nwater is not over 106 degrees F.; if no thermometer is handy put your arm\\r\\ninto the water to your elbow. It should feel warm, but not so hot as to be\\r\\nuncomfortable. Put one-half teacupful of powdered mustard in the tub.\\r\\nPlace the baby in the tub, body all covered, and hold the head out of the\\r\\nwater; keep him in the bath for five to ten minutes; wrap him in a blanket\\r\\nand put into bed without drying.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following is given to prevent convulsions:--\\r\\n\\r\\n      Bromide of Potash  1/2 dram\\r\\n      Chloral Hydrate     15 grains\\r\\n      Simple Syrup         2 ounces\\r\\n      Mix thoroughly.\\r\\n\\r\\nGive one teaspoonful every hour, while the baby is nervous or feverish.\\r\\nFor one-year-old child.\\r\\n\\r\\nMOTHERS\\' REMEDIES.--1. Convulsions, a Grandmother\\'s Remedy for.--\"Dip the\\r\\nfeet and limbs in warm water; give dry salt in mouth.\" Care should be\\r\\ntaken not to give too much salt as you may choke the child. Also apply\\r\\ncold cloths to the head, to draw the blood from the brain.\\r\\n\\r\\n[ALL ABOUT BABY 617]\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Convulsions, Hot Mustard Water for.--\"Put patient in tub of hot mustard\\r\\nwater, with cold cloths to the head,\" The hot mustard water draws the\\r\\nblood from the head to the feet and the cold cloths assist in doing good\\r\\nby keeping the blood away from the head. This is, an old, tried and\\r\\neffective remedy,\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Convulsions, Old Tried Remedy for.--\"Put patient in hot bath; give\\r\\ncastor oil and rub vigorously.\" The castor oil does good in cases where\\r\\nthe bowels are too loose or constipated, as the case may be, by carrying\\r\\noff the impurities, and the hot bath equalizes the circulation, relieving\\r\\nthe convulsion.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Convulsions, A New York Mother\\'s Remedy for.--\"Chloroform one-half\\r\\ndram, tincture of cardamom, one-half ounce, spearmint water, two and\\r\\none-half ounces. Shake well and give one-half teaspoonful in water to\\r\\nchild one year old, smaller children a proportionate dose.\" The chloroform\\r\\nis very quieting, and the tincture of cardamom and spearmint act on the\\r\\nbowels. This combination will quiet the child, and in that way relieve the\\r\\ntrouble.\\r\\n\\r\\n(See \"Convulsions\" in General Department for Mothers\\' Remedies).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nINFLAMMATION OF THE BRAIN.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat are the early symptoms of brain diseases? Temperature is usually very\\r\\nhigh, 104 degrees F. and over. There is stupor or delirium, and vomiting\\r\\nis common; light hurts the eyes; the child jumps and starts at the\\r\\nslightest noise, unless the hearing is affected. There is often a squint,\\r\\nthe eyes may be turned upward, and the lids may be only half closed during\\r\\nsleep. The pupils are dilated or contracted, Sometimes one pupil is larger\\r\\nthan natural, while the other is smaller.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat can I do for these symptoms? Cold to the head, either by ice bags or\\r\\ncold water cloths. The room should be dark and quiet. No food given unless\\r\\nordered, and then bland and very little at a time. A doctor should always\\r\\nbe called for such symptoms; castor oil to move the bowels should be given\\r\\nor an enema of soap-suds and water. This helps to draw the blood from the\\r\\nbrain, also keep the feet warm and head cool.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSCALD HEAD (in Babies) Milk Crust.--This is often due to neglect in\\r\\nregularly removing the free secretion, or due sometimes to an inflammation\\r\\nof the little sebaceous follicles of the skin. It occurs on the scalp\\r\\nmost. The hair should be cut short, and soften the crusts with warm olive\\r\\noil, or vaselin may be left on the scalp over night, then wash off the\\r\\ncrusts with warm water and castile soap. An ointment can be made of\\r\\nvaselin or cold cream, and two per cent resorcin, and applied after the\\r\\ncrust is resumed. Spread on linen and hold it in place by a thin cap, wash\\r\\nthis off every day with olive oil and apply the salve fresh. Water should\\r\\nnot be used oftener than once a week--oxide of zinc ointment is also good.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[618 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nMOTHERS\\' REMEDIES.--l.

If this treatment is kept up faithfully, you will be\\r\\nsure to obtain a cure.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTEETHING.--There are twenty teeth in the first set. There is sometimes\\r\\nslight fever, restlessness, sleepless nights, maybe loss of appetite and\\r\\nsome indigestion. If signs of indigestion are seen, give less food, and\\r\\nreplace same with boiled water. If he is a nursing baby give him an ounce\\r\\nof boiled water before nursing and nurse him only ten to fifteen minutes.\\r\\nIf he is restless at night give him a warm sponge bath, and if there is\\r\\nany fever, add one teaspoonful of bicarbonate of soda to a basin of tepid\\r\\nwater. If the gums are very much congested and swollen and the child\\r\\nsuffers, they may need to be lanced. Sometimes the teeth come earlier, but\\r\\ngenerally between the fifth and ninth months. They appear usually as\\r\\nfollows:--\\r\\n\\r\\n    2 lower central incisors                 6 to  9 months (often earlier)\\r\\n    4 upper incisors                         7 to 10 months\\r\\n    2 lower lateral incisors                12 to 14 months\\r\\n    2 anterior upper molars                 12 to 16 months\\r\\n    2 anterior lower molars                 12 to 16 months\\r\\n    2 upper canines (eye teeth)             18 to 24 months\\r\\n    2 lower canines (stomach teeth)         18 to 24 months\\r\\n    2 lower and 2 upper posterior molars    24 to 30 months\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the first year the child should cut six teeth; next six months, six\\r\\nor more; at two years he should have sixteen; at two and one-half years\\r\\ntwenty.

It is generally a\\r\\nmatter of little importance. It is a spasmodic contraction of the\\r\\ndiaphragm, often caused by gas or wind or too much food in the baby\\'s\\r\\nstomach. It is very annoying, and should not be allowed to go on\\r\\nindefinitely. Pat the baby gently, but suddenly, on the back, or give him\\r\\na little hot water in which there are a few grains of sugar or a drop of\\r\\nessence of peppermint. See that he does not feed too fast or suck an empty\\r\\nbottle.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nENLARGED GLANDS.--Cutting teeth or sometimes a bad cold or other things\\r\\ncause the glands at the sides of the neck to swell and enlarge. This does\\r\\nnot always give any discomfort to the baby, but it annoys and worries the\\r\\nmother. Frequently the enlargement will soon disappear of itself, but\\r\\nsometimes the gland grows larger, gets quite hard and often much\\r\\ninflamed--matter or pus will then form, and a discharge soon follows.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--If the gland keeps on enlarging, a doctor should be seen, and\\r\\nif it needs lancing he can do so at the proper time, and save the neck\\r\\nfrom a bad scar. Medicine can also be given that will sometimes stop it.\\r\\nSyrup of iodide of iron three to ten drops, three times a day for a\\r\\none-year-old child is good; cod-liver oil should be given to pale, thin\\r\\nchildren for a long time.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBED-WETTING.--If a child continues to wet the bed after he is three years\\r\\nold, something should be done for this annoying habit. The child should be\\r\\nexamined by a doctor; circumcision will often effect a cure in boys; or\\r\\npin worms may be the cause of the trouble; a stone in the bladder, or any\\r\\ntrouble that makes him nervous, or it may be due to habit.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--Scolding will not do any good. The child should not drink any\\r\\nfluids after four in the afternoon. He should not have any bread and milk\\r\\nor water for supper, but instead have bread and a dry cereal, with a\\r\\nlittle stewed fruit; sometimes a child needs a tonic. It is a tedious\\r\\ntrouble to treat and it takes a long time to gain control of it. The\\r\\nmother must have a large stock of patience and co-operate with the doctor.\\r\\nThe child should pass urine before retiring, have the foot of the bedstead\\r\\nelevated, not too warmly covered so as to become restless. His suppers\\r\\nshould not be hearty, bowels should be regular. The following is a good\\r\\nremedy:--Tincture of belladonna; give five drops at bed-time and increase\\r\\nthe dose, drop by drop, each night until it produces a fine scarlet rash\\r\\nupon the skin. This should be marked \"poison\" and only given under the\\r\\ncare of a doctor. It is a good remedy, but it must be watched.\\r\\n\\r\\n[620  MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHIVES.--Hives, or urticaria, is often seen in young children, It is\\r\\ngenerally caused by indigestion. It is not a serious disease, but it is\\r\\nuncomfortable and makes a baby cross. The eruption is bright red in color,\\r\\nand appears in blotches or wheels.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--Give the child a laxative like magnesia or citrate of\\r\\nmagnesia, or epsom salts and cream of tartar, of each two ounces. Dose,\\r\\none-half teaspoonful in water every three hours until the bowels move\\r\\nfreely. (One-year-old).\\r\\n\\r\\nTo relieve the itching.--Sop the spots with warm water, and a little soda,\\r\\nor an entire bath can be given of this if the eruption is extensive.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRUPTURE in a Baby. (Navel).--Take a strip of oxide of zinc adhesive\\r\\nplaster about one and one-half inches wide and long enough to reach\\r\\nthree-fourths around the baby\\'s body. Fasten one end of this to one side\\r\\nof the abdomen and with the other hand gently push the rupture back; bring\\r\\nthe skin on either side of the navel together so that it will meet and\\r\\nhold the rupture. Bring the plaster tightly across the abdomen, across the\\r\\nnavel and attach it firmly to the other side; change this dressing every\\r\\nfew days and continue treatment until healed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCOLDS in Babies.--Many babies seem to take cold without any cause. It is\\r\\noften due to the fact that the room is too warm, or they are clothed too\\r\\nwarmly; they get easily overheated and feel the slightest draught of air.\\r\\nIf it is in his nose and it is stopped up, twist a piece of cotton on a\\r\\nsmall wooden piece like a tooth-pick and dip it into olive oil and put it\\r\\ninto the nostrils a short distance. If necessary, buy a nose syringe with\\r\\na soft rubber tip, and use it twice daily. The following solution is good:\\r\\none-half teaspoonful of boric acid powder, one ounce of glycerin, and\\r\\neight ounces of warm water. Mix. Place the child on your lap, head against\\r\\nyour chest, bend his head well forward and syringe one nostril and then\\r\\nthe other. Camphor cream is a good remedy. For a cough and much wheezing\\r\\nuse a mustard plaster. Take one part mustard, six parts flour and mix it\\r\\ninto a smooth paste with a little cold water, spread it between two layers\\r\\nof muslin, warm it and moisten with a little water if necessary, and put\\r\\nit on the upper part of the breastbone. Leave it on only long enough to\\r\\nredden the skin (five to six minutes). Put it on just before baby goes to\\r\\nbed. A drop of camphor every three hours is often good for a cold at the\\r\\nbeginning. Aconite in small doses is also very good.\\r\\n\\r\\n[ALL ABOUT BABY 621]\\r\\n\\r\\nMOTHERS\\' REMEDIES. Colds, Catnip Tea for.--\"Give a little sweetened catnip\\r\\ntea, then grease well with camphor and lard.\" This is a very simple and\\r\\neffective remedy, especially for small babies.\\r\\n\\r\\n(See \"Colds\" under General Department for more Mothers\\' Remedies,)\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly signs of sickness.--When a baby who persistently refuses his food is\\r\\ndrowsy at unusual times, fretful, feverish, and is uncomfortable, the\\r\\nmother should look in baby\\'s mouth, for sore throat or tonsils, or on his\\r\\nbody for rashes. Undress the baby and put him to bed in a quiet room away\\r\\nfrom the rest of the family, and if he is hot and restless give him a\\r\\nsponge bath with one teaspoonful of bicarbonate of soda to a basin of\\r\\nluke-warm water. Give him also an enema to move his bowels, especially if\\r\\nthey are not regular. Dilute his usual food with water or barley water to\\r\\none-half the usual strength. If he is old enough to eat solid food, stop\\r\\nit. A dose of a teaspoonful of castor oil is safe to give until the doctor\\r\\ncomes. Give him water to drink for he is thirsty. Take his temperature.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCARING FOR BURNS, BRUISES, CUTS, WOUNDS, ETC., IN BABY.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor Burns.--Keep away the air from the burn. Dust soda on the burn if the\\r\\nskin is not too much broken, and wrap it up in clean linen. Olive oil,\\r\\nlinseed oil, is better, or cream should be put on if it is more severe.\\r\\nThen a layer of clean linen and then a thin layer of cotton wool. It must\\r\\nnot be too warmly dressed. An ointment called pineoline is excellent for\\r\\nburns.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a bruise or bump.--Apply cloths hot or cold,--you can do this with\\r\\nflannel wrung out of very cold or hot water. Ice may be wrapped up in\\r\\ncotton and put on the part.\\r\\n\\r\\nCuts.--Wash it with clean cold water, and bind it up with clean linen. If\\r\\nit bleeds much, let it bleed for a few seconds, and then stop it with a\\r\\npad of clean linen pressed firmly on the part and held there until it\\r\\nstops.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSPLINTERS.--Remove them and dress as for any other wound.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPOISONING.--Children will get hold of poison, and mother had better have\\r\\nantidotes, etc., to use in case of necessity. Rat poison, fly poison,\\r\\nmatches, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment.--First use emetics; mustard and luke-warm water or one\\r\\nteaspoonful of alum in a glass of luke-warm water; a little salt and warm\\r\\nwater; ten to fifteen drops syrup of ipecac, and then warm water. For fly\\r\\npoison, give one-half ounce of olive oil in same amount of lime-water, and\\r\\nrepeat it every five or six minutes, for five or six doses, and then white\\r\\nof an egg, and keep child warm. Antidote for arsenic is freshly\\r\\nprecipitated, sesquioxide of iron. Go to druggist and tell him to prepare\\r\\nit; tell him what it is wanted for, and give this in doses of an ounce at\\r\\na time as the oil was given.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor poisoning from sucking matches.--Vomit the child freely, but do not\\r\\ngive anything oily, as milk or egg, as this dissolves the phosphorus.\\r\\n\\r\\n[622 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nOxalic acid is sometimes used for cleaning purposes, and mistaken for\\r\\nepsom salts. Give an emetic and lime-water.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor carbolic acid.--Give an emetic, and then white of an egg and epsom\\r\\nsalts.\\r\\n\\r\\nOverdose of soothing syrup.--Keep baby awake, slap with wet towel, etc.;\\r\\nor walk him about if he is old enough, inject strong black coffee in the\\r\\nrectum. Keep up the strength with stimulants.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPROPRIETARY FOODS.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese foods are sometimes of temporary use. As many of them contain very\\r\\nlittle fat, they may be used in cases of illness where fat cannot be\\r\\nborne. Some of these contain malt sugar, and when the baby is constipated\\r\\nthis kind is useful when added to milk. Others can be made up of water\\r\\nonly, and are useful and handy where it is impossible to obtain fresh\\r\\nmilk. In cases of diarrhea the flour foods made up with water are very\\r\\nuseful. Milk at that time acts as a poison. Some of the best foods on the\\r\\nmarket are the following--Condensed milk, Mellin\\'s food, Horlick\\'s Malted\\r\\nmilk, Nestle\\'s food, Imperial granum, Just\\'s food, Carnrick\\'s soluble\\r\\nfood, Ridge\\'s food, peptogenic milk powder, Lactated food, Eskay\\'s,\\r\\nAlbumenized food, cereal milk, Borden\\'s food.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor constipation in a child.--One to two teaspoonfuls of Mellin\\'s food,\\r\\nadded to each bottle of his usual modified milk formula will often help a\\r\\ngreat deal. As soon as the bowels move naturally it should be gradually\\r\\ndiminished until after four or six weeks, the child can do without it.\\r\\n\\r\\nCondensed milk and Malted milk.--These can be prepared with water only,\\r\\nand so are best to use on a long journey. Give the baby one or two meals\\r\\ndaily a week or two before the journey. Discontinue when at the end of the\\r\\njourney.\\r\\n\\r\\nImperial Granum.--This is often useful in acute diarrhea, when milk cannot\\r\\nbe given. Mix the proportion as given on the box with water into a smooth\\r\\npaste, then add a pint of boiling water and boil for fifteen or twenty\\r\\nminutes.\\r\\n\\r\\nPeptogenic Milk Powder.--This may be used for a short time during or after\\r\\nacute illness; you can add it to the formula used as directed on the\\r\\npackage.\\r\\n\\r\\n[NURSING DEPARTMENT 625]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNURSING DEPARTMENT\\r\\nIncluding\\r\\nCare of the Sick and the Sick Room\\r\\n\\r\\nFOODS, FORMULAE, DELICACIES FOR SICK ROOM,\\r\\nHOW TO PREPARE THEM; DIET IN FEVERS\\r\\nAND OTHER DISEASES, SECURED FROM\\r\\nTRAINED NURSES, PHYSICIANS\\r\\nAND HOSPITALS.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery Phase of Nursing Given in Detail and in Plain Mothers\\'\\r\\nLanguage, including Latest Sanitary Care and Science.\\r\\n\\r\\nVENTILATION.--The sick room should be ventilated without any draught\\r\\nhitting the patient. The patient\\'s bed should be placed out of the line of\\r\\nair currents. If this is not possible he must be protected by means of\\r\\nscreens, the head of the bed being especially guarded. That draughts are\\r\\ndangerous is founded on fact no less than is the modern idea that an\\r\\nabundance of fresh air is necessary and helpful. A nurse has been guilty\\r\\nof gross neglect of duty when the patient contracts pneumonia through\\r\\nexposure to too severe currents of air. A simple way to ventilate a\\r\\nprivate room is to raise the lower sash of window six inches and place a\\r\\nboard across the opening below; the air will then enter between the two\\r\\nsashes and be directed upward, where it becomes diffused and no one in the\\r\\nroom is subjected to a draught. In a room where there is only one window a\\r\\npane of glass may be taken out and a piece of tin or pasteboard may be so\\r\\nplaced that the current will be directed upwards; or a window can be\\r\\nopened in an adjoining room which fills with fresh air and the door of the\\r\\nsick room opened afterwards to admit the air; or, the patient may be\\r\\ncovered up, head and all, for a few minutes two or three times a day,\\r\\nwhile all the windows are thrown open, The room should be thoroughly\\r\\nwarmed before it is so thoroughly ventilated.\\r\\n\\r\\n[624 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTEMPERATURE OF THE ROOM.--This should be regulated by a thermometer\\r\\nsuspended at a central point in the room. The temperature should be\\r\\nregulated according to the nature of the disease and the comfort of the\\r\\npatient. In fevers it should be lower, varying from 55 to 60 degrees F.,\\r\\nbut in bronchial troubles it should be kept about 70 degrees F. The mean\\r\\ntemperature should be kept about 60 degrees to 70 degrees. It should be\\r\\nraised or lowered gradually, so that the patient will not be overheated or\\r\\nchilled.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLIGHT.--The patient should have plenty of light and sunshine, but do not\\r\\nlet the sun or light shine directly upon the face.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCARE OF THE DISCHARGES (Excreta).--This is very important. Sputa, dirty\\r\\nvessels, soiled dressings and linen are prolific sources of impure air.\\r\\n\\r\\nSputum Cups.--These should be of glazed earthenware, without any corners\\r\\nor cracks and provided with a simple moveable cover when in use. They\\r\\nshould be sterilized for one hour in every twenty-four hours.\\r\\n\\r\\nBed Pans and Urinals.--These should be washed out thoroughly. Allow\\r\\nboiling hot water to run on them for some time before they are put away\\r\\nafter being cleansed.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoiled Dressing and Linen.--These should be received in covered basins or\\r\\nin paper bags and at once carried away and destroyed or disinfected, or\\r\\nput in a metal dressing can and closely covered until the contents can be\\r\\ncared for at the earliest possible time. Vomited matter or the discharges\\r\\nfrom the bowels and the urine should always be covered in the vessel\\r\\neither with a lid, towel or rubber cloth. The rubber is better than the\\r\\ncloth as it keeps in the odor and can be scrubbed and disinfected.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the patient is too sick to use a sputum cup, the expectoration can be\\r\\nreceived in a paper handkerchief or a piece of cheese cloth and placed in\\r\\na small paper bag and burned at once.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSOILED AND STAINED LINEN.--These should be put away in a covered\\r\\nreceptacle that contains enough disinfectant solution to keep them moist.\\r\\nThey are removed as soon as possible to the wash room to be cleaned and\\r\\nsterilized.\\r\\n\\r\\nSterilization.--This term is usually employed when heat is used to\\r\\nsterilize.\\r\\n\\r\\nDisinfection.--This is the term used when chemicals are relied upon to\\r\\npurify (sterilize).\\r\\n\\r\\nHeat and Chemicals are much aided by sunshine, light and fresh air,\\r\\nespecially that of high dry climates.\\r\\n\\r\\n[NURSING DEPARTMENT 625]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe germs (bacteria) are destroyed by dry or moist heat, the latter used\\r\\nin the form of steam. Dry heat is not so penetrating and requires a longer\\r\\ntime and some goods are destroyed when exposed in it long enough to\\r\\ndestroy the germs.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn order to destroy these organisms it is thought to be necessary to\\r\\nexpose whatever is to be sterilized to the steam at 200 degrees F. for\\r\\nthree successive days for thirty minutes or more each day, and during the\\r\\ninterval to keep them in a room with a temperature of 60 degrees F.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA SIMPLE METHOD OF STERILIZING.--Put the articles (small articles) in an\\r\\nordinary kitchen steamer; closely cover it and place it over a pot of\\r\\nboiling water. If you wish you can add two parts of carbonate of sodium to\\r\\neach ninety-eight parts of water.\\r\\n\\r\\nGermicides are chemicals used to destroy germs.\\r\\n\\r\\nDisinfectants are chemicals used to arrest and prevent their development.\\r\\nThese disinfectants should always be fresh.\\r\\n\\r\\nCarbolic acid is one of the most efficient and most frequently employed of\\r\\nthe known chemical disinfectants. It comes to us in the form of white\\r\\ncrystals and dissolves in water, glycerin, or alcohol.\\r\\n\\r\\nWatery solutions cannot be made stronger than five per cent. Solutions\\r\\nweaker than this will not destroy all germs, but on account of its\\r\\nirritating qualities the weaker solutions are employed when used for the\\r\\nskin and mucous membranes. How to make a five per cent or one to twenty\\r\\nsolution:\\r\\n\\r\\nA bottle containing the crystals is placed in hot water until they are\\r\\nmelted (or you can buy this dissolved product). Then take one part of the\\r\\nacid and add it to nineteen parts of boiling water and shake this\\r\\nvigorously until all has been thoroughly dissolved and mixed. To make a 1,\\r\\n2, 3 or 4 per cent solution, you take 1/100 or 1/50 or 1/33 or 1/25 of\\r\\nacid.\\r\\n\\r\\nCorrosive Sublimate or Bichloride of Mercury.--Tablets can be bought at\\r\\nany drug store containing the desired strength, and are better to use.\\r\\nThis is a powerful irritant poison and must be used carefully. Tablets of\\r\\nthe strength of 1-1000 and 1-2000 are most often employed for germicide\\r\\naction. The weaker solutions 1-5,000 or 1-10,000 were used to wash out the\\r\\ncavities. It is not now used much for that purpose; it stains clothing and\\r\\ncorrodes instruments.\\r\\n\\r\\nMilk of Lime is considered very valuable and safe to use in vessels to\\r\\nreceive evacuations from the bowels. It should be freshly made or it is\\r\\nuseless. Equal parts should be stirred up with the contents of the bed pan\\r\\nand this must be let stand at least one hour. This is the best way to\\r\\ndisinfect stools.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Prepare Milk of Lime.--The milk of lime is made by adding one part of\\r\\nslaked lime to four parts water.\\r\\n\\r\\nChloride of Lime (Chlorinated lime) is also a very good disinfectant. It\\r\\nhas a bad odor and unless it is very fresh, is not reliable.\\r\\n\\r\\n[626  MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nBoric acid disinfectant. This property is not very marked, but it is not\\r\\nirritating. The standard solution is five per cent. The weaker solutions\\r\\nare used to clean cavities, for superficial wounds, and to wash out the\\r\\nbladder.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe standard or saturated solution is made by using one part of the acid\\r\\nin crystal form to nineteen parts of water; or, this saturated solution\\r\\ncan be easily made by putting a large quantity of the crystals in a filter\\r\\nand pouring the quantity of boiling water over them slowly until all are\\r\\ndissolved. Strain the solution to get rid of the excess of crystals or it\\r\\ncan be allowed to cool when the liquid can be poured off.\\r\\n\\r\\nNormal salt solution is made by using one teaspoonful of salt to a pint of\\r\\nwater.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCARE AND DISINFECTION OF AN INFECTED ROOM.--Carpets, upholstered\\r\\nfurniture, hangings, bric-a-brac, or any personal clothing, the color of\\r\\nwhich may be destroyed by disinfection, should have been removed from the\\r\\nroom at the beginning of the disease.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDAILY CARE OF THE ROOM BY THE NURSE.--The furniture should be wiped off\\r\\nwith a damp cloth and the floor swept with a broom covered with a damp\\r\\ncloth wrung out of a 1-20 (five per cent) carbolic acid solution; besides\\r\\nthis the floor must be rubbed thoroughly with a damp cloth every second or\\r\\nthird day. If the disease is contagious a damp sheet kept moist should be\\r\\nhung in the line of the air currents. Cloths that are used daily should be\\r\\nwashed in hot soap suds and when not in use left to soak in carbolic acid\\r\\nsolution 1-20 (five per cent).\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the patient has recovered from an infectious disease he should\\r\\nreceive a hot soap and water tub or sponge bath, thorough washing of the\\r\\nhair and irrigation of the ears included, followed by a thorough sponging\\r\\nwith a one per cent carbolic acid or corrosive sublimate (1-10,000)\\r\\nsolution. The finger-nails and toe-nails should be cut close and cleaned\\r\\nunderneath.\\r\\n\\r\\nA nasal douche is given, and the mouth should be washed with listerine or\\r\\na saturated (five per cent) solution of boric acid. The patient is then\\r\\nwrapped in clean sheets or clothes and taken in another room. Then the\\r\\nbedding and clothing are made ready for sterilization.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDISINFECTION OF THE ROOM.--Brush off the mattress, wrap it in a damp sheet\\r\\nwrung out of a twenty per cent solution of carbolic acid, and send to the\\r\\nsterilizer. The clothes are steamed and sent to the wash room. When there\\r\\nis no sterilizer the bed must be soaked in a 1-20 (five per cent) carbolic\\r\\nsolution, afterwards boiled and the mattress ripped apart and boiled or\\r\\nburned.\\r\\n\\r\\n[NURSING DEPARTMENT 627]\\r\\n\\r\\nDISINFECTING THE ROOM.--Arrange all articles that are left in the room so\\r\\nas to expose them the best to the fumigating substance. To disinfect with\\r\\nformalin, close the room tightly, seal all cracks and openings with paste\\r\\nand paper. Place an alcohol lamp in a metal dish in the center of the\\r\\nroom. Put in a receptacle over the lamp three fluid ounces of a forty per\\r\\ncent solution of formaldehyde; have a dish of water in the room for some\\r\\ntime; moisten the air of the room, light the lamp and then close the room\\r\\nup tight for twenty-four hours, until the dust has settled; then enter\\r\\ngently so as not to disturb the dust and wipe off everything in the room\\r\\nwith a cloth wrung out of a corrosive sublimate (1-1000) solution. Floors,\\r\\nwoodwork, furniture, bedstead must be so washed or wiped, and use for\\r\\ncrevices pure carbolic acid, applying it with a brush. The walls should be\\r\\nwashed down with the 1-1000 corrosive sublimate solution. Then leave the\\r\\nwindows wide open. Sulphur fumigation is not considered so certain in its\\r\\nresults.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHOW TO TREAT SPUTUM FROM TUBERCULOUS PATIENTS.--Sputum is dangerous when\\r\\nit is dry. The sputum cups should be of china or paper, so that they may\\r\\nbe either boiled or burned. There should be no crevices. The cup should be\\r\\nkept covered and the sputum moist so that none of the germs on the sputum\\r\\nbecoming dry may escape into the air of the room. The china vessel should\\r\\nbe frequently cleaned and, before the contents are thrown away, the germs\\r\\nmust be destroyed by putting the sputum in a two per cent solution of\\r\\ncarbonate of soda for one hour. The paper cups and contents must be burned\\r\\nbefore the contents have time enough to become dry. In infectious\\r\\ndiseases, all discharges from the nose, mouth, bowels and bladder should\\r\\nbe received in a china vessel containing carbolic acid or milk of lime.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Diphtheria the expectoration, discharge from the nose and vomited\\r\\nmatter should be received in paper napkins and burned at once in the room,\\r\\nor if this is impossible, boiled before being taken from the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nUse the same treatment for the discharges in Scarlet fever. Two sets of\\r\\ncups should be kept and boiled in the soda solution before being used. All\\r\\nvessels, tubes or cups that are used for the mouth in diphtheria,\\r\\nsyphilis, or cancer should be kept in a 1-40 solution of carbolic acid and\\r\\nboiled before being used by another patient.\\r\\n\\r\\nBed-pans used in cases of cancer, dysentery, typhoid fever and, in short,\\r\\nin all infectious diseases, are to be soaked in a 1-20 (five per cent)\\r\\ncarbolic acid solution and boiled before again coming into general use.\\r\\n\\r\\nSheets and clothing stained with typhoid fever discharges must be washed\\r\\nout at once, or soaked in a disinfectant solution and steamed before being\\r\\nsent to the laundry. Also the bedding and clothing in any infectious or\\r\\nmalignant disease should always be put to soak, at once, in a 1-20 (five\\r\\nper cent) carbolic acid solution, or else steamed or boiled before being\\r\\nbrought again into general use.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe urine needs the same attention as the bowel discharges in typhoid\\r\\nfever.\\r\\n\\r\\nCoughing in diphtheria, lung tuberculosis, scarlet fever, etc., sets free\\r\\ninfectious germs. These may be received in the person of the attendant, or\\r\\non the bedding and furniture. Care should be taken when attending such\\r\\ncases.\\r\\n\\r\\n[628 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCARE OF THE MOUTH AND TEETH.--A weak solution of borax or listerine is\\r\\nvery good. One-half ounce of listerine to a glass of water to be used by\\r\\nthe patient as often as he desires to rinse his mouth. Lemon juice in\\r\\nsolution is very good. For cracks in the mouth, vaselin or cold cream is\\r\\ngood. A few drops of oil of peppermint can be added, or oil of\\r\\nwintergreen.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor spongy and sore gums.--A few drops of tincture of myrrh added to pure\\r\\nwater may be used. Colorless golden seal in the same way is pleasant and\\r\\nsuccessful.\\r\\n\\r\\nCloths for washing the teeth and mouth are made in small squares of gauze\\r\\nor old linen. They are best to use since they can be burned immediately\\r\\nafter being used. Wrap one of the squares around the first finger, dip it\\r\\ninto the mouth-wash and insert in the mouth. Go over the whole cavity, the\\r\\ncloth being passed along the gums and behind the wisdom teeth, thence over\\r\\nthe roof of the mouth, inside the teeth and under the tongue. Use more\\r\\nthan one piece for all this. This is very necessary in typhoid fever. If\\r\\nthe tongue is badly coated, it can be soaked and gently scraped. A good\\r\\nmouth-wash for general use is the following:\\r\\n\\r\\n    Glycerin                    1 dram\\r\\n    Soda                       10 grains\\r\\n    5% solution of Boric Acid   1 ounce\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBED SORES. Prevention and care of.--Very fat flabby people or thin\\r\\nemaciated patients are liable to suffer from bed sores. They result from\\r\\nconstant friction or pressure on a certain spot or spots and when the body\\r\\nis poorly nourished. Moisture, creases in the under sheets, night gown,\\r\\ncrumbs in the bed and want of proper care and cleanliness also are causes.\\r\\n\\r\\nBed-sores due to pressure occur most frequently upon the hips and lower\\r\\nback, the shoulders and heels; those from friction, in the ankles, inner\\r\\nparts of the knees, or the elbows and back of the head. In patients\\r\\nsuffering from dropsy, paralysis or spinal injuries, or when there is a\\r\\ncontinuous discharge from any part of the body, the utmost care must be\\r\\ntaken to prevent bed sores.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment. Preventive.--Cleanliness and relief from pressure. Bathe the\\r\\nback and shoulders with warm water and soap night and morning and\\r\\nafterwards rub with alcohol and water equal parts. Dust the parts with\\r\\noxide of zinc or stearate of zinc powder, or bismuth mixed with borax; all\\r\\nare good. If there is much moisture due to sweating or involuntary stools\\r\\nor urine, castor oil should be well rubbed in addition. The sheets must be\\r\\nkept smooth and dry under the patient.\\r\\n\\r\\n[ NURSING DEPARTMENT 629]\\r\\n\\r\\nRedness of the skin may be the first symptom of this trouble. This may be\\r\\nfollowed by a dark color under the skin, and when the cuticle finally\\r\\ncomes off the underlying tissues are found broken down and sloughing. Any\\r\\nskin scraped or worn off--abrasion--should be carefully washed and a small\\r\\npad of cotton smeared with olive oil and stearate of zinc placed over it\\r\\nand kept there with collodion painted over it; or white of egg painted\\r\\nover the sore is sometimes very beneficial; also equal parts of castor oil\\r\\nand bismuth make an excellent dressing. Rubber rings or cotton rings over\\r\\nthe part relieve the pressure. Changing the position is often beneficial.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment of the Sore Proper.--Sponge with clean soft cloths, with a\\r\\nsolution of boric acid or one per cent solution of carbolic acid and the\\r\\ncavity packed with iodoform gauze, or iodoform, or aristol ointment, over\\r\\nwhich apply a layer of borated cotton. Dress the sore daily. If it sloughs\\r\\napply hot boric acid dressings every four hours and follow with an\\r\\napplication of castor oil and balsam of Peru. When it is better treat as\\r\\nany other sore.\\r\\n\\r\\nBATHS.\\r\\n\\r\\n    A   hot bath temperature is from   100 to 112 degrees F. or higher.\\r\\n    A  warm bath temperature is from    90 to 100 degrees F.\\r\\n    A tepid bath temperature is from    70 to  90 degrees F.\\r\\n    A  cool bath temperature is from    65 to  70 degrees F.\\r\\n    A  cold bath temperature is from    33 to  65 degrees F.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe entire bath should not last longer, when given in bed, than fifteen or\\r\\ntwenty minutes. A few drops of water of ammonia or a little borax will\\r\\nhelp much in getting the patient clean and disguise the bad odor of the\\r\\nperspiration. A little alcohol or Eau de Cologne will be found refreshing.\\r\\nCold damp towels should never be employed here. The water should be\\r\\npleasantly warm and changed a few times during the bath. A glass of hot\\r\\nmilk can be taken after the bath is given, if the patient feels exhausted,\\r\\nand if the feet are cool a hot fruit can is applied.\\r\\n\\r\\nFoot Baths in Bed.--The patient should lie on her back, with the knees\\r\\nbent and place her feet in the tub, which is placed lengthwise in the bed\\r\\non a rubber sheet spread across the lower part of the bed for protection.\\r\\nA mustard foot bath can be given the same way except that the knees and\\r\\nfoot bath are enclosed in a blanket. These are often given for severe\\r\\ncolds, with head symptoms (headaches), when it is desired to draw the\\r\\nblood from the head. Hot water alone will do this, but the mustard hastens\\r\\nthe action. The mustard should be mixed with a small amount of water\\r\\nbefore being added to the bath. The amount will depend upon the\\r\\nsensitiveness of the patient. The feet may remain in the bath for fifteen\\r\\nto twenty minutes, the water kept at the same temperature or made warmer\\r\\nby adding more hot water from time to time. They are wiped gently\\r\\nafterward and tucked snugly in blankets.\\r\\n\\r\\n[630 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nHot Bath, Hot Air, Vapor, and Steam Bath.--Given for sweating purposes.\\r\\nFill the tub half full of water at 100 degrees F. and draw it to the\\r\\nbedside if necessary. Lift the patient into the tub and gradually increase\\r\\nthe temperature by the thermometer to 110 degrees and 112 degrees F.\\r\\nMaintain it at this point for twelve or fifteen minutes. After this the\\r\\npatient is lifted out into a prepared bed on which a long rubber is spread\\r\\nwith three or four hot blankets over it; these are wrapped all around the\\r\\npatient, tucked in closely about the neck and watched continually to see\\r\\nthat no air enters. Give plenty of water to drink, as it promotes\\r\\nperspiration and helps in that way to cast off the impurities. Keep this\\r\\nup for an hour if possible, and then the patient is gradually uncovered,\\r\\nsponged under a blanket with alcohol and water and the wet blankets\\r\\nremoved. Cloths wrung out of cold water are applied to the head during\\r\\nthis bath. The pulse should be closely watched for any indication of\\r\\nfaintness, when the patient should be put to bed, immediately. This bath\\r\\nshould not be given during menstruation or pregnancy.\\r\\n\\r\\nWarm Baths (90 degrees to 100 degrees F.) are frequently given to children\\r\\nfor convulsions. They should be placed in the tub and cold applied to the\\r\\nhead, while the body is washed and rubbed.\\r\\n\\r\\nLocal baths and packs.--For sprains, a foot bath. For menstrual pain, a\\r\\nsitz bath. The patient sits in the bath with only the thighs and part of\\r\\nthe body immersed, while the upper part of the body and the feet are\\r\\nprotected with blankets. Sitting on a cane-seated chair over a steaming\\r\\npail with a blanket around the neck and body gives a good bath for pain\\r\\nduring menstruation.\\r\\n\\r\\nSalt-water bath. Tonic action.--Nine to fourteen pounds of sea salt to\\r\\nfifty gallons of water will redden the skin and give an exhilarating\\r\\neffect.\\r\\n\\r\\nDry Salt Bath sent us with Mothers\\' Remedies.--\"To a basin of water put a\\r\\nbig handful of salt, take a Turkish towel and soak it in the salt water,\\r\\nwring out and let dry. The salt will adhere to the towel. Use to rub the\\r\\nbody. A tepid bath should be taken next day to remove the salt.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nStarch bath.--Add eight ounces of laundry starch to each gallon of water.\\r\\nThis allays skin irritation.\\r\\n\\r\\nBran bath.--Put the bran in a bag and allow this to soak in warm water for\\r\\nan hour before being used; or it may be boiled for an hour and then the\\r\\nfluid drained and added to the bath water.\\r\\n\\r\\nSponge bath.--Water and soap should be ready. Clothes to be put on, well\\r\\naired and at hand. Then remove the patient\\'s clothes and wrap him in an\\r\\nold blanket, expose only the part being washed at a time, wash and dry\\r\\nthis part. Begin with the face and neck, then the chest, abdomen, arms and\\r\\nback, and lastly the lower extremities. Warm the water at least twice.\\r\\nThen put on his clean, well aired clothes and into a clean bed, and the\\r\\npatient will bless you.\\r\\n\\r\\n[NURSING DEPARTMENT 631]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlcohol sponge bath.--This is given the same way, only sixty per cent\\r\\nalcohol is used and the parts are allowed to dry themselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nTub bath (common).--Prepare everything as to heat, etc. Then carry the\\r\\npatient or assist him to the tub. Soap him all over and pour water over\\r\\nhim from a large pitcher. The temperature of the water depends upon the\\r\\ndisease. One person should continually rub the patient in typhoid fever to\\r\\nkeep up the circulation while the water is being poured over him. A hot\\r\\ndrink is given before and after these baths and the patient is wrapped\\r\\nimmediately in warm flannel.\\r\\n\\r\\nPatients are frequently put into a tub with a water temperature of 85 to\\r\\n90 degrees, and then the water temperature decreased by adding cold water.\\r\\nThis bath must be carefully given.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cold pack.--It is used to reduce fever, delirium and extreme\\r\\nnervousness and to induce sleep. Cover the bed with a rubber sheet or\\r\\noilcloth, and over this a blanket. Wring a sheet out of cold water and\\r\\nplace this over the blanket. Lay the patient on this sheet and wrap it\\r\\naround him so that every surface has the wet sheet next to it. Tuck the\\r\\nsheet in well at the neck and feet. Fold the outer blanket over the\\r\\npatient and tuck it in. Lay a wet towel over the head, or he can be\\r\\nenveloped loosely in blankets and allowed to remain twenty minutes to an\\r\\nhour, only ten to fifteen minutes by the tucked-in method and then dried\\r\\nand put to bed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hot pack.--This is given in the same manner except that the patient is\\r\\nwrapped first in a blanket wrung out of boiling water. More covering is\\r\\nput over the patient than in a cold pack, and something cold is applied to\\r\\nthe head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEXTERNAL APPLICATIONS.\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral and Local.--For dry heat, for warmth alone, hot bags, bottles and\\r\\ncans are used. Hot flannels are sometimes used for inflamed joints. Make\\r\\nthe flannel very hot, wrap in heated paper or cloth and apply quickly;\\r\\ncover all with a layer of cotton, wool and oiled muslin.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor neuralgia and earache, salt bags are used.\\r\\n\\r\\nFill flannel bags with salt, heat as hot as can be borne, and cover it so\\r\\nas to retain the heat after it is applied to the ear.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor moist heat.--This is more penetrating and has a more pronounced effect\\r\\nthan dry heat. It also hastens suppuration when it cannot be prevented in\\r\\nacute inflammation like quinsy, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor local pains, fomentations, stupes and poultices are used. Poultices\\r\\nare best for deep-seated pain or continuous inflammation.\\r\\n\\r\\n[632 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nLinseed meal poultice.--Stir the meal slowly and evenly in boiling water;\\r\\nboil this mixture for several minutes and stir briskly all the time, and\\r\\nwhen thick enough it is well beaten with a spoon to remove lumps. If this\\r\\nis properly done it will be a light smooth paste, just stiff enough to\\r\\ndrop away from the spoon. Use a muslin or coarse cloth and spread the\\r\\npoultice on this to the depth of one-half inch, leaving one inch space to\\r\\nturn in. Put vaselin over the surface, thin, and cover with a thin layer\\r\\nof gauze or thin cloth. Turn the edges over and roll in a towel to keep it\\r\\nwarm and carry to patient. Keep them warm,--one should never be removed\\r\\nuntil another is ready to be put on. The skin should always be wiped dry\\r\\nbefore another is applied. Oiling the poultice prevents irritation of the\\r\\nskin and pimples. Cover the poultice loosely if possible with a layer of\\r\\ncotton-wool and oiled muslin to retain the heat and moisture longer. It\\r\\nshould be changed every three hours at least. Apply hot and never keep on\\r\\nwhen it is cold. It should never be used a second time.\\r\\n\\r\\nStarch Poultice.--This is used in skin diseases for its soothing\\r\\nproperties. Mix the starch first with a little cold water and then add\\r\\nenough boiling water to make a thick paste, which is then spread on muslin\\r\\ncovered with a layer of gauze.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Jacket Poultice. For lung affections.--Two layers of thin muslin are\\r\\nshaped so as to fit closely around the neck and under the arms and come\\r\\nover the chest and back, low enough to cover the lungs. Three sides are\\r\\nnow closed, and the prepared linseed is poured into the bag and regularly\\r\\ndistributed. Close the open end and then apply. Cover it with wool and\\r\\noiled silk and keep in place with safety pins or tapes which are tied\\r\\nunder the arms and over the shoulders. When changing the poultice be\\r\\ncareful not to expose the patient. A cotton-wool jacket should be worn a\\r\\nfew days after the poultice has been discontinued.\\r\\n\\r\\nCold is applied either by means of the cold bath or by compresses, pack,\\r\\nsponging, coils or ice.\\r\\n\\r\\nCold Compresses are made by using two or three thicknesses of lint or\\r\\nlinen wrung out of cold water or ice water and applied over the inflamed\\r\\npart, and changed frequently. A little vaselin may be rubbed on to prevent\\r\\nthe skin from becoming irritated. They are very useful where little weight\\r\\ncan be borne. If iced compresses are used a small block of ice partially\\r\\nwrapped in flannel is placed in a basin; there should be two compresses,\\r\\none of which is kept on ice while the other is on the patient.\\r\\n\\r\\nCompresses are very good in the early stage of tonsilitis, quinsy, sore\\r\\nthroat, laryngitis and croup.\\r\\n\\r\\nIce-bags (India Rubber).--With these, cold can be best applied and with\\r\\nless trouble. These are made in different shapes. For instance\\r\\nhelmet-shaped to fit the head and long and narrow for the spine.\\r\\n\\r\\nCrush the ice in small pieces and mix in it a little common salt,--never\\r\\nfill the rubber bags more than half full; expel the air as much as\\r\\npossible by pressing before screwing on the top. Always place a layer of\\r\\nlint, cotton or thin cloth between the skin and the bag. The extreme cold\\r\\nis not only painful but liable to irritate the skin, and may cause\\r\\nfrost-bites. Its effect should be watched carefully. Sometimes the weight\\r\\ncauses discomfort. In such cases suspend the bag. For the head, fasten a\\r\\nbandage to the neck of the bag and pin the two ends to the pillow just\\r\\nhigh enough to allow the cap (bag) to barely touch the head. Care should\\r\\nbe taken to refill the ice-bags before the ice has melted. At times a\\r\\npiece of ice is wrapped in moist lint or old linen and passed gently over\\r\\nthe head in order to cool the head.\\r\\n\\r\\n[NURSING DEPARTMENT 633]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor Appendicitis.--There should be quite a thickness of cloth between the\\r\\nice bag and the skin. The latter must not become too cool. In this disease\\r\\nthis bag is a great reliever of the pain and generally used.\\r\\n\\r\\nIce Poultices.--In some cases these are better than the ice bag for the\\r\\nreason that they fit the body better. They are usually made of two parts\\r\\nof crushed ice to one of linseed meal or bran, together with a small\\r\\namount of salt. Make two bags of oiled silk,--one should be smaller than\\r\\nthe other. Close all sides but one, with adhesive plaster. Fill the\\r\\nsmaller bag two-thirds full of ice, close and slip it into the larger bag.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIce Water Coils.--These can be bought. They can also be made from rubber\\r\\ntubing. Sew this upon a piece of rubber cloth in circles about one inch\\r\\napart for five or six rounds; leave a yard or two of tubing at each end to\\r\\nbe used as a siphon, A large pan of ice water is raised above the patient\\r\\ninto which one weighted end of the tubing is placed, with a funnel\\r\\ninserted into it, covered with gauze to prevent clogging, while the other\\r\\nend is laid in a second basin on the floor which receives the water. The\\r\\nupper pan must be kept filled. This is very good for delirium in brain\\r\\nfever, etc., when applied to the head and also good for bleeding from the\\r\\nbowels in typhoid fever. The stream of water can be regulated if necessary\\r\\nby a stop-cock.\\r\\n\\r\\nLotions.--Lotions are medicated moist applications, and may be either hot\\r\\nor cold.\\r\\n\\r\\nCounter--Irritants are agents applied externally to produce irritation or\\r\\ninflammation in order to relieve a diseased condition in an adjacent or\\r\\ndeep-seated part of the body. Mustard foot-bath relieves pain in the head\\r\\nby drawing the surplus blood away from the head. The mildest mustard\\r\\ncounter-irritant is the mustard poultice. It can be made with one part\\r\\nmustard to six of linseed meal. Never use boiling water with mustard.\\r\\n\\r\\nMustard Poultice.--Use of ground mustard, one-fourth to one-eighth of the\\r\\namount of meal used. Make into a paste and stir this into the linseed,\\r\\nafter it has been prepared for the poultices. The white of an egg is used\\r\\nin this poultice as it may keep the poultice from blistering.\\r\\n\\r\\nYeast Poultices.--These stimulate ulcers, gangrene and sloughing\\r\\nconditions. Mix eight ounces of soft yeast with as much water. Add enough\\r\\nflour to make a sponge, but not too stiff. It should be kept warm until\\r\\nfermentation begins; then apply every day. Finely powdered charcoal can\\r\\nalso be added.\\r\\n\\r\\n[634 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor Soothing Effect.--Hop bags or bran bags, dipped in hot water, may be\\r\\napplied, protected and kept in place with a bandage.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpice Poultice.--This is very good for pain in abdomen in children\\r\\nespecially. Equal parts of ground cinnamon, cloves, allspice and ginger,\\r\\none-quarter part cayenne pepper, if needed very strong. Place all together\\r\\nin a flannel bag and spread equally. Wet with alcohol or brandy. When dry,\\r\\nre-wet. This is a mild warming dressing.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpice Poultice from a Stanlyton, Va., Mother.--\"Take one teaspoonful each\\r\\nof mustard, ginger, black pepper, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, or as many\\r\\nground spices as one has in the kitchen; mix them well in a bowl while\\r\\ndry, adding boiling water slowly and stir constantly until it is of the\\r\\nconsistency of soft putty; spread between soft thin cloths and apply to\\r\\nthe affected parts as hot as the patient can bear it. When it is cool heat\\r\\nit again and apply.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMother\\'s Flour and Water Poultice.--\"Make a thick poultice of flour and\\r\\nwater; bake soft and apply hot. Have another ready for change, if\\r\\nnecessary. This is good for any pain.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPoultice of Peach Tree Leaves from our Mother\\'s List.--\"Put a handful of\\r\\npeach leaves in a vessel and let boil well; add enough meal to thicken,\\r\\nspread between thin muslin cloth and apply to parts affected. This is a\\r\\nsplendid poultice.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMild Plaster for Children.--\"Two teaspoonsful of flour, three teaspoonsful\\r\\nof mustard, a little fresh lard and a few drops of turpentine, Mix up with\\r\\nwarm water.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFomentations.--This is the best way to apply moist heat, but it is\\r\\ntroublesome, as they should be changed very frequently, at least every ten\\r\\nminutes when heat is required. They should never be left on until they are\\r\\ncold and clammy. Sheets of lamb\\'s wool make the best material. Cut these\\r\\nlayers into sizes required and encase them in a gauze cover over which is\\r\\nput a layer of oiled silk. Coarse old flannel or an old blanket will do\\r\\nwell. Take two layers of the flannels, dip in the boiling water and wring.\\r\\nTwo should be at hand. Dry the skin first and then put on the flannel. It\\r\\nshould be covered with enough material to keep in the heat and moisture.\\r\\nHops, etc., can be put into the water.\\r\\n\\r\\nTurpentine Stupes.--This is prepared the same way, except turpentine is\\r\\nadded. After the flannel has been wrung out, add from ten to twenty drops\\r\\nof turpentine, or add two or three teaspoonfuls of turpentine to one pint\\r\\nof boiling water and put the flannel in it and wring out and apply. Put a\\r\\ntowel over the stupe. This is especially for gas in the bowels.\\r\\n\\r\\nMustard Stupe.--Put a tablespoonful of mustard in one pint of hot water.\\r\\nMake a paste of the mustard before it is put into the hot water, to avoid\\r\\nforming lumps; never use boiling water. Wring the flannel out after it has\\r\\nbeen in this solution and apply to the part.\\r\\n\\r\\n[NURSING DEPARTMENT 635]\\r\\n\\r\\nMustard Plaster.--This is made of different strengths, depending upon the\\r\\nlength of time it is desired to keep it on and the sensitiveness of the\\r\\nskin.\\r\\n\\r\\n  1. Equal parts of mustard and flour.\\r\\n  2. One of mustard and two of flour.\\r\\n  3. One of mustard and three or four of flour.\\r\\n  White of an egg added makes it better and not so blistering.\\r\\n\\r\\nA paste is made with warm water and spread between the layers of muslin\\r\\nand left on no longer than ten minutes. When the skin is red remove the\\r\\nplaster. This is used when you wish a quick counter-irritation.\\r\\n\\r\\nMustard Plaster.--This is made stronger, 1 to 2 to 3 parts meal.\\r\\n\\r\\nMustard leaves or Sinapisms may be bought at a drug store. They are no\\r\\nbetter than you can make. Use plasters.\\r\\n\\r\\nCapsicum and Belladonna Plasters.--May be bought. In applying, heat the\\r\\nback of the plaster slightly; the face of the gauze is pulled off and the\\r\\nplaster placed where wanted. To remove soak first with alcohol.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpice plaster.--Mix two teaspoonfuls each of ginger and cloves with a\\r\\nteaspoonful of cayenne pepper, one tablespoonful of flour, enough brandy\\r\\nor water to make a paste. Spread this between two layers of muslin.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor Turpentine and Mustard Stupes see above.\\r\\n\\r\\nTincture of iodine, chloroform and liniments are also counterirritants,\\r\\nalso castor oil, and pure tartar emetic, and cartharides.\\r\\n\\r\\nCupping, Wet and Dry.--This is sometimes used to relieve inflammations of\\r\\nthe eye, lung or kidney, or even muscular pains like lumbago. Wine-glasses\\r\\nwill do as well as any you can buy.\\r\\n\\r\\nDry cupping.--Take a piece of wire, wrap a small piece of cotton about the\\r\\nend, dip this in alcohol, light it and swab the inside of the glass,\\r\\nremove and apply the glass. The heat causes the air to expand and it is\\r\\ndriven off and the partial vacuum formed is filled by the skin and tissues\\r\\nover which the glass is placed. The edges of the cup must not be warm\\r\\nenough to burn the patient. Six or seven cups may be applied at one time\\r\\nand allowed to remain five minutes, after which they are removed by\\r\\npressing the flesh around the edge and inserting the finger there so as to\\r\\nlet in the air.\\r\\n\\r\\nLinseed meal poultices can be applied afterwards to keep up the work\\r\\nbegun.\\r\\n\\r\\nWet cupping.--Scrub the skin with hot water and soap, wash off with a five\\r\\nper cent (1-20) carbolic acid solution. Make a few cuts over the parts\\r\\ndesired with a clean knife and apply the cup prepared in the way above\\r\\ndirected. Remove the blood and check the bleeding, if necessary, by\\r\\nsponging. Place a pad on the part and hold this in place by a bandage or\\r\\nadhesive strap.\\r\\n\\r\\nBlistered Skin. To dress.--Puncture the lower part with a clean instrument\\r\\nand catch the fluid on absorbent cotton. Dress it with oxide of zinc\\r\\nointment or vaselin on lint or clean linen and strap on. It is best not to\\r\\nremove the skin from a blister at the first dressing.\\r\\n\\r\\n[636 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHOW TO DETERMINE THE DOSE FOR CHILDREN.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have endeavored to always give the dose throughout this book as we\\r\\nrecognized the lack of accurate and detailed information regarding the\\r\\nadministering of medicines as one of the weak features in practically all\\r\\nhome medical books. If we have overlooked a few instances we wish to\\r\\nprovide for such omissions by giving the table of doses generally used by\\r\\nnurses as a basis for determining the dose of any medicine she may be\\r\\nusing for a particular age.\\r\\n\\r\\nRule usually followed.--For children under twelve years of age. Make a\\r\\nfraction. Use the age of the child for the upper number, numerator. The\\r\\nnumber below the line, denominator, is twelve, added to the age of the\\r\\nchild. For example: If your child is two years old you would begin by\\r\\nplacing two as numerator, thus 2/, then you add 2 + 12 = 14 and place 14\\r\\nbelow the line and you have 2/14 or 1/7. You then take 1/7 of the adult\\r\\ndose for your two-year-old child.

If you are beginning housekeeping let this be your first\\r\\nconsideration. Do not put it off because it is a little trouble and costs\\r\\na few dollars. Yon would not think of leaving your front room or your\\r\\n\"spare room\" half furnished. Your health is of vastly more importance than\\r\\nthe looks of your best rooms. There may come a time when you cannot secure\\r\\nthe doctor for several hours or get into a drug store. Be prepared for\\r\\nthis emergency and either fix up a home-made box with shelves, etc., or\\r\\nbuy a regular medicine chest; in either case have a lock to it and the key\\r\\nwhere you can find it but where the children cannot reach it.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe give below a few of the necessaries and you will of course add to this\\r\\nlist. One mother writes that she went to the store and bought several tiny\\r\\nlittle bells and tied one of these bells around the neck of each of the\\r\\nbottles in her medicine chest that contained poison.

The eyes should be closed and the jaws held in position by means\\r\\nof a support placed firmly under the chin; for this a roller bandage or a\\r\\nsmall padded piece of wood is generally used. Of course if the person has\\r\\nworn false teeth, and they have been taken out during the last hours, they\\r\\nshould be replaced immediately after death. The nostrils, mouth, rectum,\\r\\nand vagina should be packed with absorbent cotton to prevent the escape of\\r\\ndischarges after death. After this bathe the body, if so desired by the\\r\\nrelatives, with a two per cent watery solution of carbolic acid, and if\\r\\nthere are any wounds they should be covered with fresh cotton and neatly\\r\\nfastened with a bandage. The hips may be enclosed in a large triangular\\r\\nbinder; the knees are held together by a broad bandage; the hair should be\\r\\nbrushed smoothly, and finally stockings and a simple nightgown should be\\r\\nput on. If the case be one of the infectious diseases, wrap the body in a\\r\\nsheet wrung out of a five per cent watery solution of carbolic acid and\\r\\nthis sheet should be kept damp.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe room where death occurs should be tidied and regulated to make it look\\r\\nnatural and comfortable. The undertaker can be sent for as soon as desired\\r\\nby the family. But if such care as directed has been given, the undertaker\\r\\nneed not be hurried.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nENEMA.--Enemata (Injections).--There are various methods used for\\r\\ninjecting fluids into the body. When they are introduced into the\\r\\nintestines, we speak of giving enemata (enema is the singular). They are\\r\\nnamed according to their purpose.\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Simple laxative or purgative enemata.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Nutritive enemata for the purpose of nourishment.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Sedative enemata for local or systemic quieting effects.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Astringent enemata to check bleeding and diarrhea, like hot water, ice\\r\\nwater, solution of alum or nitrate of silver.\\r\\n\\r\\n5. Emollient (soothing) enemata for soothing irritated and painful mucous\\r\\nmembrane; starch and drugs are also used.\\r\\n\\r\\n6. Antispasmodic enemata to relieve flatulence such as the turpentine\\r\\nenemata.\\r\\n\\r\\n7. Anthelmintic (against worms) for destroying worms; salt, turpentine and\\r\\nquassia are used.\\r\\n\\r\\n8. Antiseptic or germicidal enemata used in dysentery.\\r\\n\\r\\n9. Stimulating enemata, like hot water, hot strong coffee, hot whisky and\\r\\nwater, salt water.\\r\\n\\r\\n10. To relieve thirst, water one pint or normal salt solution (one dram to\\r\\na pint of water) and injected high up.\\r\\n\\r\\n[NURSING DEPARTMENT 639]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nENEMATA are given either high or low.\\r\\n\\r\\nA high enemas thrown high up into the bowel.\\r\\n\\r\\nA low enema is injected into the rectum only, through a hard rubber tip to\\r\\na syringe.\\r\\n\\r\\nDirections.--There are many ways of giving a simple enema.\\r\\n\\r\\nPosition.--A good way is to place an adult patient on his left side, with\\r\\nthe knees bent up close. Protect the bed with a rubber sheet and towel\\r\\nunder the patient. The basin of water can be placed on the rubber sheet\\r\\nand the enema given under cover.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmount.--An adult person will take one to four pints. A child one-half to\\r\\none pint. For an infant about two ounces will do.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat material? A simple enema can be made with good castile soap or good\\r\\nbrown soap and water, temperature about 95 degrees F. When ready for use\\r\\nmake into a good suds.\\r\\n\\r\\nSyringe.--Use a bulb syringe, see that the syringe is filled full to the\\r\\nnozzle before the nozzle is put into the bowel. Any air left in the\\r\\nsyringe will pass into the bowel and cause pain. Oil the nozzle with\\r\\nvaselin or sweet oil and then gently put the nozzle into the rectum. It is\\r\\nbetter to introduce an oiled finger through the sphincter muscle and pass\\r\\nthe nozzle along the finger and gently into the bowel. It should be in the\\r\\nbowel two or three inches. Do not attempt to force the nozzle through any\\r\\nobstruction. Introduce the water slowly in a gentle and steady stream. The\\r\\nmain object is to distend the rectum by means of the water, thereby\\r\\nproducing reflex stimulation. The worm-like movement of the bowels\\r\\nresults, thus bringing about an evacuation. The patient should retain it\\r\\nfor ten or fifteen minutes to get the best results. A folded towel placed\\r\\nagainst the anus will assist the patient in resisting the desire to expel\\r\\nthe water. A large amount should be given in one-half hour if the first\\r\\none does not produce the desired result.\\r\\n\\r\\nSometimes a laxative enema is necessary.--Olive oil or glycerin or castor\\r\\noil may be used.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor olive oil, six ounces may be given in a hard rubber syringe; this is\\r\\nseldom successful unless followed by a soap suds enema in one-half hour.\\r\\n\\r\\nGlycerin enema, one-half ounce with equal quantity of warm water 95\\r\\ndegrees F., and give with a hard rubber syringe. This generally proves\\r\\nsuccessful, without an additional soap suds enema.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor infants and children the contents of a straight medicine dropper will\\r\\nbe sufficient.\\r\\n\\r\\nGlycerin irritates the mucous membrane, and it is best that we add an\\r\\nequal amount of olive oil.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf these enemata fail it will be necessary to use purgative enemata. These\\r\\nare made by adding drugs, such as turpentine, rochelle or epsom salts or\\r\\ncastor oil in certain proportions to the simple enema. In giving castor\\r\\noil and water it is necessary first to mix the oil with the yolk of an egg\\r\\nand then add the warm soap suds.\\r\\n\\r\\n[640 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Formula.--\\r\\n\\r\\n    Castor Oil       2 ounces\\r\\n    Turpentine     1/2 ounce\\r\\n\\r\\nMix thoroughly and inject with hard rubber syringe, followed in one-half\\r\\nhour by a quart of soap-suds.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Formula.--\\r\\n\\r\\n    Turpentine       1/2 ounce\\r\\n    Rochelle Salts     1 ounce\\r\\n\\r\\nMix with warm soap-suds, one pint.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe buttocks and anus should be washed off with warm water after\\r\\nturpentine has been used in the enema.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Molasses and Laxative Enema.--Mix from two to ten ounces, according to\\r\\nage, with one pint of soap suds and inject slowly.\\r\\n\\r\\nNutritive Enemata.--Food is given by the bowel when the stomach cannot\\r\\nretain it. It is then called Nutritive Enemata. They should be given only\\r\\nfrom four to six times in twenty-four hours and the quantity given at one\\r\\ntime should not exceed four ounces. It must be introduced high up in the\\r\\nbowel, about ten inches, and therefore they should be given through a\\r\\nrectal tube made of heavy rubber one-quarter inch in diameter and at least\\r\\neight inches of it should be inserted in the bowel. After it has been\\r\\noiled the tube is gently inserted in a backward, upward, direction and a\\r\\nglass funnel is attached to the outer end. The enema has been already\\r\\nmixed in a small pitcher and gently poured (very slowly) into the funnel,\\r\\nwhich is then raised so that the contents will go slowly through the tube\\r\\ninto the bowel. The patient is protected from drops by a folded towel\\r\\nunderneath him. Then the tube is slowly withdrawn. The tube should then be\\r\\ncleansed by allowing warm water to run through it, and then kept in a one\\r\\nper cent solution of boric acid. Food given by enemata should be very\\r\\nnourishing and concentrated. The following are excellent formulas:\\r\\n\\r\\nFormula 1.--\\r\\n\\r\\n    One whole Egg\\r\\n    Table Salt        15 grains\\r\\n    Peptonized Milk    3 ounces or 3/8 of a cup\\r\\n    Brandy            1/2 ounce\\r\\n\\r\\nFormula 2.--\\r\\n\\r\\n    White of two Eggs\\r\\n    Peptonized Milk     2 ounces or 1/4 of a cup\\r\\n\\r\\nThe whole amount should never exceed four ounces. The addition of salt\\r\\naids the absorption of the egg. Brandy, and whisky are very irritating and\\r\\nshould be given only every other time.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fresh raw milk can be used, if it is impossible to have it peptonized.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a nutritive enemata the patient should lie quietly on his back for\\r\\ntwenty or thirty minutes.\\r\\n\\r\\n[NURSING DEPARTMENT 641]\\r\\n\\r\\nTurpentine enemata for distention may be given according to the following\\r\\nformula:\\r\\n\\r\\n    Mucilage of Acacia       1/2 ounce\\r\\n    Spirits of Turpentine     10 drops\\r\\n\\r\\nThis should be administered high up in the bowel.\\r\\n\\r\\nAstringent Enemata. To check diarrhea.--They should be given slowly and\\r\\ninjected high up, and they should be retained as long as possible.\\r\\n\\r\\nStarch and Laudanum.--Boil the starch as if to be used in the laundry and\\r\\ndilute with luke-warm water, until it is thin enough to pass through a\\r\\ntube. Take of this three ounces. This can be given alone in mild cases;\\r\\nbut if there is much pain and straining add ten to fifteen drops of\\r\\nlaudanum to the starch water or thirty to forty drops of paregoric. This\\r\\ndose is for an adult.\\r\\n\\r\\nStimulating Enemata. 1. Black coffee.--One-half to one pint of strong\\r\\ncoffee, injected as hot as possible. It should be strained before using.\\r\\nThis is frequently given in poison cases.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Salt Enemata.--Two teaspoonfuls to one quart of hot water is mildly\\r\\nstimulating; one-half to one ounce of brandy or whisky may be added.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDOUCHES.--By this term is generally meant a jet of fluid directed with a\\r\\ncertain amount of force upon a limited external or internal surface, for\\r\\ncleansing, stimulating purposes and to relieve inflammation. Three common\\r\\ndouches are the ear (aural), the vaginal and the rectal.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Vaginal Douche. For cleansing.--A one per cent solution of carbolic\\r\\nacid is often used in one to three quarts of water.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo allay inflammation.--A hot solution of the temperature of 105 degrees\\r\\nto 115 degrees is given, and three or six quarts may be used. Allow the\\r\\nstream to flow before the nozzle is inserted so as to have the warm\\r\\ntemperature instead of cold at the start, and the nozzle should be\\r\\nintroduced up towards the posterior vaginal wall. The fountain syringe bag\\r\\nshould not be raised more than six to twelve inches above the patient who\\r\\nis lying down with her hips raised on pillows and her knees drawn up.\\r\\nMedicines can be used in all the douches.\\r\\n\\r\\nRectal douche.--This is to relieve piles and reduce inflammation. Hot or\\r\\ncold as needed. A rectal tube or fountain syringe is used.\\r\\n\\r\\nEar (aural) douche.--This is used for earache and inflammation. Salt or\\r\\nboric acid is generally used in the warm water. It should be allowed to\\r\\nflow in slowly and gently.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow to use a bed pan.--When you are placing the pan, you should slip one\\r\\nhand under the buttocks and then place the flat end of the pan under the\\r\\nbuttocks. It should always be warm. Raise the patient in the same way\\r\\nbefore attempting to remove it. Do not pull it out.\\r\\n\\r\\n[642 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTEMPERATURE (Fever).--A thermometer is necessary in taking the\\r\\ntemperature. They can be bought for from fifty cents up. The temperature\\r\\nis taken by putting the thermometer under the tongue, in the arm-pit and\\r\\nin the rectum. For children it should be placed in the rectum or in the\\r\\narm-pit or groin. Allow it to remain from two to five minutes. This\\r\\ndepends upon the time limit of the thermometer. The normal temperature is\\r\\n98-6/10 degrees F. This varies, some people are normal at times at 99 or\\r\\n98 degrees. The temperature in the arm-pit is lower by 3/10 of a degree,\\r\\nbut that in the rectum is 1/2 degree higher than that taken in the mouth.\\r\\nThe normal point on the thermometer is marked by an arrow. The mercury in\\r\\nthe tube must always be down to that at its highest point, before the\\r\\nthermometer is placed and the highest point the mercury goes indicates the\\r\\nheight of the temperature (fever). If you take it in the rectum, that\\r\\nshould be free from feces. Oil the thermometer and gently insert it into\\r\\nthe bowel for one and one-half inches and hold the stem.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder the Tongue.--Place the point under the tongue and instruct the\\r\\npatient to close his lips over the thermometer. He can also hold the stem\\r\\nwith his fingers, It should never be taken here right after a cold drink.\\r\\nUnconscious patients may bite through the instrument, so care must be\\r\\ntaken with them.\\r\\n\\r\\nArm-pit.--Wipe the part thoroughly dry and place the point directly in the\\r\\narm-pit. Then place the elbow against the body and the hand on the chest\\r\\npointing to the opposite shoulder. When ready to take it out move the arm\\r\\naway from the body and take the thermometer away gently for it sticks\\r\\nsometimes and you will cause pain if you draw it away quickly. The\\r\\ninstrument should be cleansed in tepid mild salt solution.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPULSE.--Average in men, sixty to seventy. In women, sixty-five to eighty.\\r\\nChildren ninety to one hundred to one hundred and twenty. Different\\r\\nauthors vary. In men it is generally seventy to seventy-two. In women\\r\\nseventy-two to seventy-five.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is better taken sitting. It is faster when walking, slower when lying\\r\\ndown. I always take the pulse in the left arm unless there is a deformity\\r\\nthere. I use my right hand with the third finger toward the elbow. By\\r\\nusing the first three fingers you can find out different things about the\\r\\npulse. Some people are very nervous and such an one will make your arm\\r\\nache when feeling the pulse. The pulse should be regular, even beats, in\\r\\nhealth. Sometimes you can feel it best on the temple or on the neck.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRESPIRATION (Breathing).--In an adult the average is eighteen per minute.\\r\\nIn a child the average is twenty to twenty-four. Respiration is the act of\\r\\ntaking in (inspiration), and giving out (expiration) air by the lungs.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE TONGUE.--This is coated in dyspepsia and fevers,--some healthy persons\\r\\nalways have a coated tongue.\\r\\n\\r\\n[NURSING DEPARTMENT 643]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Ulcers of the stomach there is no coating.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn high fevers, the tongue may also be red and cracked as well as coated\\r\\nin some parts.\\r\\n\\r\\nA dark brown or blackish coating indicates a serious condition in acute\\r\\ndiseases.\\r\\n\\r\\nStrawberry tongue is seen in Scarlet Fever.\\r\\n\\r\\nCankered tongue and month may be due to local conditions, or to stomach,\\r\\nliver and bowel disorders.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Peritonitis the tongue is generally dry and red (beefy).\\r\\n\\r\\nCholera Infantum.--At first coated, then dry and reddish.\\r\\n\\r\\nConstipation.--Tongue is generally coated.\\r\\n\\r\\nBiliousness.--Yellowish dirty coating.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDIET\\r\\n\\r\\nFOODS AND DRINKS FOR THE SICK ROOM.\\r\\n\\r\\nDIET.--The importance of diet and its relation to the needs of the system\\r\\nin disease can hardly be overrated. One should not only know what kind of\\r\\nfood to give, but how much and how often it should be given to get the\\r\\nbest result. Food should be given in small quantities in acute diseases\\r\\nand at regular intervals. It will digest better. The food should never be\\r\\nleft in the sick room after a patient has finished with it. This applies\\r\\nto all kinds of food, but especially to milk, for it absorbs impurities\\r\\nfrom the air more readily than any other kind of food. How often do we see\\r\\nmilk standing in a sick room and uncovered; how often is it placed in an\\r\\nice box uncovered. I have often wondered how such people could eat some\\r\\nfoods I have seen prepared for them in such a careless way and with no\\r\\nattempt to make it appear tempting to their poor appetite. Foods should be\\r\\ngiven just as regularly as medicines, when so ordered, especially in long\\r\\nwasting diseases like typhoid fever.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe kind of food.--Under each disease directions for the kind of food,\\r\\ntime, and quantity have been given. In diseases like typhoid fever,\\r\\nspecial care must be given. It is better in that disease to give too\\r\\nlittle than too much food and the proper kind of food must be given. I\\r\\nshall never forget the death of a minister in my childhood days. I was\\r\\nabout four years old. This minister was loved by everyone and when he died\\r\\nof typhoid fever, everyone was grieved and shocked and they could not\\r\\nunderstand why God should take such a useful man away. It made a great\\r\\nimpression upon me. I found out more about the \"why\" afterwards. This\\r\\nminister was in the convalescent stage and very hungry. He wanted a\\r\\ngenuine boiled dinner. That is bad enough for a well man. The doctor\\r\\nforbade it, but the family gave him the dinner and the result, of course,\\r\\nwas fatal. It could not be otherwise. We often blame God for our own sins.\\r\\nMany people are killed by kind friends. I have seen it more than once.\\r\\nPeanuts, popcorn, and candy have caused many convulsions in children and\\r\\nsome deaths.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is generally allowable to give a little liquid food every two hours in\\r\\nacute diseases. It should be given at regular intervals in the conscious\\r\\nor unconscious patients, especially in long continued diseases.\\r\\n\\r\\n[644       MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES ]\\r\\n\\r\\nLIQUID DIET.\\r\\n\\r\\n1.

Less sugar may be used.\\r\\n\\r\\n[NURSING DEPARTMENT 651]\\r\\n\\r\\nOatmeal, Barley or Rice Water. From the Grain: Use two tablespoonfuls of\\r\\ngrain to a quart of water. The grain should have been previously soaked\\r\\nover night or at least for a few hours. When required for an emergency the\\r\\nsoaking may be dispensed with and the grain boiled for five minutes\\r\\ninstead. The water in which the grain was soaked should be poured off and\\r\\nfresh water added before cooking. The grain should be boiled for several\\r\\nhours, water being added from time to time to keep the quantity up to a\\r\\nquart. Strain. This makes a somewhat thin, watery gruel. From prepared\\r\\nflours: Various brands of prepared grain flours are on the market, such,\\r\\nfor example, as Robinson\\'s Barley flour. These are all somewhat similar in\\r\\npreparation. From two rounded teaspoonfuls to a tablespoonful of the\\r\\nprepared flour is added to a pint of boiling water and this is boiled from\\r\\nfifteen to thirty minutes and then strained. No previous soaking is\\r\\nrequired.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCEREALS AND CEREAL GRUELS.\\r\\n\\r\\nEither the grain itself or the specially prepared flour may be used. When\\r\\nthe grains are used they should be spread on a clean table and all foreign\\r\\nsubstances removed. If the whole grains be used, it is well to wash them,\\r\\nafter picking them over, with two or three changes of cold water. Cereals\\r\\nare best cooked in a double boiler. The lower part should be filled about\\r\\none-third full of water and, if more is added during the soaking, it\\r\\nshould always be boiling hot. The cereal should be boiled over the fire\\r\\nfor ten or fifteen minutes. The water should be boiled first and then\\r\\nsalted. The cereal is added gradually and the whole stirred to prevent it\\r\\nfrom burning. It should then be placed in the double boiler and steamed\\r\\nuntil thoroughly cooked. Cereals, like other starchy foods, require\\r\\nthorough cooking. Most recipes allow too short a time. Oatmeal,\\r\\nespecially, should be mentioned. It develops a better flavor if cooked for\\r\\nthree hours or more, and is better when it is prepared the day before and\\r\\nreheated when used. It should be just thin enough to pour when taken out\\r\\nof boiler, and when cooled should form a jelly.\\r\\n\\r\\nAny cereal mush may be thinned with water, milk or cream and made into a\\r\\ngruel, or the gruel may be made directly from the grain or flour. Gruels\\r\\nshould be thin, not too sweet nor too highly flavored, and served very\\r\\nhot. Milk gruels should be made in a double boiler. Gruels can be made\\r\\nmore nutritious by the addition of whipped egg, either the white or yolk\\r\\nor both, and the various concentrated food products.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen cereal flours are used, the flour should be rubbed to a smooth paste\\r\\nwith a little cold water and added slowly to boiling water, stirring\\r\\nconstantly until it is thoroughly mixed.\\r\\n\\r\\n[652  MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nLENGTH OF TIME TO COOK CEREALS.\\r\\n\\r\\nCornmeal mush:   Boil 10 minutes, then steam for     3 hours or more.\\r\\nOatmeal:         Boil 10 minutes, then steam for l-1/2 hours or more.\\r\\nIrish oatmeal:   Boil 10 minutes, then steam for     8 hours or more.\\r\\nWheatena:        Boil 10 minutes, then steam for    10 hours or more.\\r\\nGluten mush:     Boil 30 minutes.\\r\\nSteamed rice:    Steam for one hour.\\r\\nBoiled rice:     Boil for twenty minutes or until soft.\\r\\n\\r\\nArrowroot Gruel.--Dissolve half a teaspoonful of sugar and a quarter of a\\r\\nteaspoonful of salt in a cupful of water and heat.

Then add the other ingredients, simmer half an\\r\\nhour longer, strain and cool. Remove the fat.\\r\\n\\r\\nChicken Broth.--Take one pound of chicken and a pint of cold water. Clean\\r\\nthe fowl, cut it into pieces, and remove the skin. Separate the meat from\\r\\nthe bone and chop the meat very fine. Place with the bones (if large they\\r\\nshould be broken) in the water and soak for an hour. Cook over hot water\\r\\nfor four or five hours at a temperature of 190 degrees. Strain and add\\r\\nsalt. Water must be added from time to time to keep the quantity up to a\\r\\npint. Remove the fat. If the broth is to be reheated use a double boiler.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeat Broth: Beef, Veal, Mutton, or Chicken.--Cover one pound of chopped\\r\\nlean meat with one pint of water, and allow it to stand for from four to\\r\\nsix hours. Then cook over a slow fire for an hour until reduced to half\\r\\nthe quantity. Cool, skim, pour into a jar and strain.\\r\\n\\r\\nVeal Broth.--Pour a pint of water on a half-pound of finely chopped lean\\r\\nveal and allow it to stand for three hours.

Both sides of the beef should be scorched\\r\\nquickly to prevent the escape of the juices, but the interior should not\\r\\nbe fully cooked. As soon as they are ready pieces of meat should be\\r\\nsqueezed in a lemon squeezer previously heated by being dipped in hot\\r\\nwater. As it drips the juice should be received into a hot wine glass; it\\r\\nshould be seasoned to the taste with salt and a little cayenne pepper, and\\r\\ntaken while hot.\\r\\n\\r\\nCold Beef Juice.--Cover one pound of finely chopped lean beef with eight\\r\\nounces of cold water and allow it to stand for eight or ten hours. Squeeze\\r\\nout the juice by means of a muslin bag; season with salt or sherry wine\\r\\nand drink cold or slightly warmed. It may be added to milk, care being\\r\\ntaken that the milk be not too hot before the juice is added.\\r\\n\\r\\nRaw Meat Juice.--Add to finely minced rump steak cold water, in the\\r\\nproportion of one part of water to four parts of meat. Stir well together\\r\\nand allow it to stand for half an hour. Forcibly express the juice through\\r\\nmuslin, twisting it to get the best results.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeef Essence.--Chop up very fine a pound of lean beef free from fat and\\r\\nskin; add a little salt, and put into an earthen jar with a lid; fasten up\\r\\nthe edges with a thick paste, such as is used for roasting venison in, and\\r\\nplace the jar in the oven for three or four hours. Strain through a coarse\\r\\nsieve, and give the patient two or three tablespoonfuls at a time.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmerican Bouillon (American Broth).--Place in a tin vessel that can be\\r\\nsealed hermetically alternate layers of finely minced meat and vegetables.\\r\\nSeal it and keep it heated in a water bath (bainmaire) for six or seven\\r\\nhours and then express the broth.\\r\\n\\r\\nBottle Bouillon.--Cut beef, free from fat, into squares. Place these in a\\r\\nstoppered bottle, put the bottle in a basin of warm water, heat slowly,\\r\\nand boil for twenty minutes. There will be about an ounce of yellowish or\\r\\nbrownish fluid for each three-quarters of a pound of meat used. The flavor\\r\\nis that of concentrated bouillon.\\r\\n\\r\\n[658 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nMethods of preparing raw beef.--Meat given raw should always be perfectly\\r\\nfresh and very finely divided. Scrape the meat with a sharp knife, which\\r\\nwill separate the coarser fibers. If the resulting mass is stringy pass\\r\\nthrough a fine sieve. This may be seasoned with salt and pepper and served\\r\\non toast, crackers or bread and butter. It may be rolled into small balls\\r\\nand swallowed. These may be flavored as desired. They may also be slightly\\r\\nbrowned by rolling about rapidly in a hot saucepan, care being taken not\\r\\nto change any but the outside of the ball, and that but slightly. Scraped\\r\\nbeef may be served as a liquid or semi-solid food. Mix it with an equal\\r\\nquantity of cold water until it is quite smooth. Place in a double boiler\\r\\nand cook until thoroughly heated, stirring constantly. Add a little salt\\r\\nand pepper and serve at once. This may be made thicker by adding less\\r\\nwater.\\r\\n\\r\\nRaw-beef Soup.--This is made by chopping up one pound of raw beef and\\r\\nplacing it in a bottle with one pint of water and five drops of strong\\r\\nhydrochloric acid. This mixture is allowed to stand on the ice over night\\r\\nand in the morning the bottle is placed in a pan of water at 110 degrees\\r\\nand kept at about this temperature for two hours. It is then placed in a\\r\\nstout cloth and strained until the mass that remains is almost dry. The\\r\\nfiltrate is given in three portions daily. If the taste of the raw meat is\\r\\nobjectionable, the meat may quickly be roasted on one side and the process\\r\\ncompleted in the manner previously described.\\r\\n\\r\\nBarley Gruel with Beef Extract.--One-half teaspoonful of \"Soluble Beef,\"\\r\\ntwo cupfuls of hot water, one tablespoonful of barley flour, one\\r\\nsaltspoonful of salt. Dissolve the beef in the hot water, and mix the\\r\\nflour and salt together with a little cold water. Pour the boiling stock\\r\\non the flour and cook for ten minutes. Strain, and serve very hot.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeef Broth with Poached Eggs.--Prepare the broth in the proportion of half\\r\\na teaspoonful of \"Soluble Beef\" to one cupful of hot water and add a\\r\\npoached egg.\\r\\n\\r\\nA Nutritive Drink for Delicate Women and Children.--This is made by mixing\\r\\none-fourth to one-half teaspoonful of \"Soluble Beef,\" five ounces of\\r\\nboiling water and one-half ounce of cream; season with salt and pepper to\\r\\nsuit the taste.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeef Broth with Grain.--Take one teaspoonful of \"Soluble Beef,\" one quart\\r\\nof water, one tablespoonful of rice, and salt to taste. Dissolve the\\r\\n\"Soluble Beef\" in the hot water and add the well-washed rice. Simmer\\r\\nslowly until dissolved and absorbed by the rice, adding more beef broth if\\r\\ntoo much boils away. If not entirely dissolved the broth should be\\r\\nstrained before using.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeef Tea Egg-Nog.--This requires one-eighth teaspoonful of \"Soluble Beef,\"\\r\\none-half cupful of hot water, one tablespoonful of brandy, and a pinch of\\r\\nsalt. Beat the egg slightly and add the salt and sugar. Dissolve the\\r\\n\"Soluble Beef\" in the hot water, add to the egg and strain. Mix\\r\\nthoroughly, adding wine, and serve.\\r\\n\\r\\n[NURSING DEPARTMENT 659]\\r\\n\\r\\nChicken Jelly.--Half a grown chicken should be well pounded, and boiled in\\r\\none quart of water for two hours until only a pint remains; season and\\r\\nstrain. Serve hot or place on ice, where it will jelly.\\r\\n\\r\\nVeal-bone Jelly.--Place ten pounds of veal bones and ten quarts of water\\r\\nor weak bouillon over the fire and bring to just a boil. Skim and add two\\r\\npounds of barley and a little salt. Simmer for five or six hours and then\\r\\nstrain. If too thick dilute, before serving, with bouillon. Stir in the\\r\\nyolk of an egg in a cup and serve.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeat Jelly.--This is made by cooking good boneless, lean beef on a water\\r\\nbath with a little water for sixteen hours or until it becomes\\r\\ngelatinized. Of the artificial preparations on the market for making\\r\\nbouillon the most reliable is Leibig\\'s Extract of Meat (10:250 gm.) or\\r\\nCibil\\'s Bouillon (one teaspoonfnl to 250 gm.), Inaglio\\'s Bouillon Capsules\\r\\nare also very convenient. If it is desired to make a bouillon more\\r\\nnutritious one teaspoonful of meat peptone may be added.\\r\\n\\r\\nJelly for Dyspeptics.--Remove the skin and meat from one calf \\'s foot;\\r\\nwash the bone and place in cold water on the stove; when it begins to foam\\r\\nskim off the refuse which gathers on top. After rinsing off the scum with\\r\\ncold water put the bones into a pot with one-quarter kilo of beef or half\\r\\nan old hen, one-quarter liter of water, and little salt, and boil slowly\\r\\nfor from four to five hours. Pour the jelly thus formed through a fine\\r\\nsieve and place overnight in a cellar. Next morning remove the fat and\\r\\nclarify the cold jelly by adding one egg with its shells mashed, beating\\r\\nand stirring steadily. Then, with the addition of a little cornstarch,\\r\\nsubject the whole to a temperature not over 60 degrees F., or the white of\\r\\nthe egg will curdle. Constantly beat and stir. If the jelly begins to get\\r\\ngrainy, cover and let it cool until the white of the egg becomes flaky and\\r\\nseparates. Then strain again several times until it becomes perfectly\\r\\nclear; add 5 gm. of extract of meat, pour the jelly into a mold, and let\\r\\nit cool again. The gravy from a roast may be utilized and is very\\r\\npalatable. It must be stirred in while the mass is still warm and liquid.\\r\\nThis jelly is usually relished with cold fowl, but spoils easily in\\r\\nsummer; it must therefore be kept on ice.\\r\\n\\r\\nGluten Bread.--Mix one pound of gluten flour with three-fourth of a pint\\r\\nor one pint of water at 85 degrees. (With some of the prepared\\r\\nflours--Bishop\\'s, for example--no yeast is required). As soon as the dough\\r\\nis mixed put it into tins and place them immediately in the oven; should\\r\\nbe made into small dinner rolls and baked on flat tins. The loaves take\\r\\nabout one and one-half hours to bake, and the rolls three-fourths of an\\r\\nhour. Either are easily made. The addition of a little salt improves the\\r\\nbread. (When any special brand of flour is used, the directions that\\r\\naccompany it should be followed closely).\\r\\n\\r\\n[660 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nA GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE FOUR LEADING SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE:\\r\\nALLOPATHY, HOMEOPATHY, OSTEOPATHY AND ECLECTICISM.\\r\\n\\r\\nALLOPATHY.--Literally the word Allopathy means \"other suffering,\" from the\\r\\nGreek \"allos\" meaning other, and \"pathos\" meaning suffering. A more\\r\\nliberal translation would be,--other methods of treating suffering. The\\r\\nterm was first used during the latter part of the eighteenth century by\\r\\nHahnemann, the founder of the Homeopathic School, to distinguish the\\r\\nordinary or regular practice of medicine as opposed to Homeopathy.\\r\\n\\r\\nNotwithstanding the comparatively recent origin of the term, however, the\\r\\nmethods and theories of Allopathy are based empirically upon the results\\r\\nof the practice of medicine since the time of Galen, and logically upon\\r\\nthe scientific facts disclosed by modern research and study. In its broad\\r\\nand popular sense, Allopathy is the preservation of health and the\\r\\ntreatment of disease by the use of any means that will produce a condition\\r\\nincompatible with the disease.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe application of the theories and methods of this \"old school\"\\r\\nnecessitates a thorough knowledge of anatomy, pharmocology, pathology,\\r\\nbacteriology, physiology and other sciences. At the present time much\\r\\nstress is also laid upon the means for the prevention and the eradication\\r\\nof diseases and their causes. The inefficiency of drugs is recognized and\\r\\nbesides the articles of the Materia Medica the \"regular\" physician makes\\r\\nuse of antitoxins, vaccines, surgery, electricity, baths, etc., in\\r\\ntreating diseases. Everyday examples of their methods may be seen in the\\r\\nuse of quinine in Malaria, antitoxins in Diphtheria and vaccines in\\r\\nSmallpox, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nHOMEOPATHY.--This school was founded by Hahnemann, who lived in Germany\\r\\nover a hundred years ago. Everyone now admits that he was a great scholar.\\r\\nIn translating a materia medica he was very much struck with the article\\r\\non cinchona, where it seemed to state that taken continuously in large\\r\\ndoses it would produce all the indications of ague. He tested other\\r\\nremedies in the same way and finally announced his law \"Similia Similibus\\r\\nCurantur.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDefinition given by a Medical Dictionary of Homeopathy.--\"A system of\\r\\ntreatment of disease by the use of agents that, administered in health,\\r\\nwould produce symptoms similar to those for the relief of which they are\\r\\ngiven.\" For instance, ipecac given in large doses, will produce certain\\r\\nkind of vomiting. If the same kind of vomiting, with the other symptoms\\r\\nagreeing, occurs in disease ipecac would be given for the trouble.\\r\\n\\r\\n[LEADING SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE 661]\\r\\n\\r\\nBut if the vomiting was produced by ipecac, that same medicine would not\\r\\nbe given to stop it, but treatment given for an over dose of the drug,\\r\\nipecac. According to the principles of Homeopathy a medicine is selected\\r\\nwhich possesses the power (drug diseases) of extinguishing a natural\\r\\ndisease by means of the similitude of its alterative qualities, (similia\\r\\nsimilibus curantur); such a medicine administered in simple form at long\\r\\nintervals, and in doses so fine as to be just sufficient without causing\\r\\npain or debility, to obliterate the natural disease through the reaction\\r\\nof vital energy.\\r\\n\\r\\nA great many medicines are used in this way by all schools, but the\\r\\n\"regular\" school claims it is not an universal law. Some homeopathic\\r\\ndoctors claim that the antitoxin treatment for diphtheria, etc. is an\\r\\napplication of the homeopathic law. The poison that produces the\\r\\ndiphtheria is taken and from this by a thorough and precise process the\\r\\nserum is made and injected into the body of a person who has diphtheria.\\r\\n\\r\\nHydrophobia is successfully treated in the same way. A homeopathic doctor\\r\\nhas a right to use any sized doses he wishes, but he claims experience has\\r\\nproven that large doses are not often necessary and that the medicine\\r\\nusually acts better attenuated.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nECLECTICISM.--An eclectic physician is a member of a school or system that\\r\\nclaims to select \"that which is good from all other schools.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis school uses very few mineral remedies, but uses many vegetable\\r\\nremedies. They have introduced a great many vegetable remedies into\\r\\nmedical practice and very many of them are useful.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe homeopathic school has benefited very much by the experience of the\\r\\neclectic system. This school uses remedies in large and small doses. Many\\r\\nof them use the homeopathic attenuated drugs.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOSTEOPATHY.--\"The name \\'Osteopathy\\' is made up of two Greek words:\\r\\n\\'Osteon,\\' which means \\'bone,\\' and \\'pathos,\\' which means suffering (to\\r\\nsuffer). \\'Pathy,\\' our English equivalent for this word, by usage has come\\r\\nto mean \"a system of treatment for suffering or disease. Hence, viewed\\r\\nstrictly from its derivation, this term, Osteopathy, would carry only the\\r\\nmeaning of bone suffering, \\'bone disease\\' or \\'bone treatment.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDefinition.--\"Osteopathy is that science of treating human ailments which\\r\\nregards most diseases as being either primarily produced or maintained by\\r\\nan obstruction to the free passage of nerve impulses or blood and lymph\\r\\nflow, and undertakes by manipulation to remove such obstruction so that\\r\\nnature may resume her perfect work.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n[662 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nExplanation.--\"While it is a distinctive theory of osteopathy that disease\\r\\nconditions, not due to a specific poison, are traceable to mechanical\\r\\ndisorder in the body, or some part of it, and that the correction of such\\r\\ndisorder is not only the rational treatment, but is necessary to the\\r\\nrestoration of a permanent condition of health, yet as a palliative\\r\\ntreatment appropriate manipulations are occasionally employed to stimulate\\r\\nor inhibit functional activity as conditions may require. Osteopaths also\\r\\nemploy such rational hygienic measures, common to all systems of healing,\\r\\nas has been proven of undoubted value, and take into account environmental\\r\\ninfluences, habits and modes of life, as affecting the body in maintaining\\r\\nor regaining health.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe \"American School of Osteopathy\" is located in Kirksville, Missouri.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe course of study required is of three years duration, of nine months\\r\\neach, and the degree of D. O. (Doctor of Osteopathy) is given to the\\r\\ngraduates.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOPERATIONS.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere has been a great change in regard to operations among the laity of\\r\\nlate years. There is much less opposition and prejudice. The people are\\r\\nbeing educated to the necessity for operating in many diseases. A great\\r\\ndeal of the opposition was due to the doctors themselves. There have been\\r\\ndoctors who would operate at every opportunity. Some doctors could not\\r\\ntreat a woman for diseases of the womb and ovaries without suggesting that\\r\\nan operation was necessary. There have been a great many healthy organs\\r\\nremoved, or at least organs that could have been saved by proper\\r\\ntreatment. Fortunately such doctors are becoming less in number and there\\r\\nis more discrimination being used. On the other hand there has also been\\r\\ntoo much conservatism. Many persons have spent years in suffering who\\r\\ncould have been relieved by an operation. Years ago a person suffering\\r\\nfrom terrific attacks of gall stone colic continued to suffer all their\\r\\nnatural life. Now an operation is performed and relief is obtained at very\\r\\nlittle risk to life. The same is true of cancers, tumors, etc. These, if\\r\\ntaken early, can be removed safely and successfully in very many cases and\\r\\nlives saved and suffering relieved.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf an operation is needed the family should go to their family physician,\\r\\nin whom they have confidence. He can do the operation or direct the family\\r\\nas to what surgeon to choose. Bad results of operations are, sometimes,\\r\\ndue to the operator. It is the duty of the family to choose a competent\\r\\nand honest surgeon. There are plenty of them all over the world,--and very\\r\\nfew competent surgeons operate simply for the money they receive. As a\\r\\nrule they earn all and more than they are paid. There are more surgeons\\r\\ntoday than ever and they are also more competent, for our medical schools\\r\\nprepare them in the hospitals for that kind of work.\\r\\n\\r\\n[OPERATIONS 663]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe surgeons connected with our hospitals, public and private, are doing a\\r\\ngreat work in relieving the ills of humanity, others in private practice\\r\\nare doing great work. Here and there one is found who operates only for\\r\\nthe money, but persons who employ such a doctor are usually entitled to\\r\\nthe results they receive. Your family physician, even if he is not a\\r\\nsurgeon, is the best person to consult when an operation may be necessary.\\r\\nHe will send you to some honest and competent man. Operations usually\\r\\nshould be performed as early as possible. In malignant disease the\\r\\noperation must be done early. This applies to cancers of the lip, face,\\r\\ntongue, breast, womb, ovaries, stomach and the abdominal cavity.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen again, operations are far less dangerous now than before the days of\\r\\naseptic and antiseptic surgery. Cleanliness on the part of the surgeon,\\r\\nnurses and patient is the first law of success in all operations. Any case\\r\\nthat becomes infected through fault of the surgeon or attendants is no\\r\\nlonger looked upon as a thoroughly successful operation, even though the\\r\\npatient recovers.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs in other branches of medicine, there are now many specialists in\\r\\nsurgery. In the major operations it is best to employ a specialist, but in\\r\\nthe minor cases the \"family doctor\" should be competent. If he does not\\r\\ncare to perform the operation himself he can advise and direct you in\\r\\nselecting a competent surgeon. Always seek his advice early; do not wait\\r\\nuntil the patient is weak or dying before you decide to allow the\\r\\noperation, as then the chances are it cannot help. If you are in doubt as\\r\\nto the necessity of the operation consult more than one surgeon. There is\\r\\na possibility of a wrong diagnosis in some cases.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSPECIAL OPERATIONS.\\r\\n\\r\\nADENOIDS.--Should be removed early when they obstruct the breathing. In\\r\\nanother part of the book the reasons are given. The same advice is given\\r\\nfor tumors and malformations in the nose passages. Such conditions should\\r\\nnot be allowed to go on until the parts are permanently deformed or\\r\\ndiseased. These operations are done very frequently and successfully now,\\r\\nand many people are saved years of worry and suffering. For more extended\\r\\naccount see department of nose and throat.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAPPENDICITIS.--There has been a great deal of discussion about this\\r\\ndisease. It is no doubt true that many healthy appendices have been\\r\\nremoved, but it is also true that many lives have been saved by operation.\\r\\nThere is more discrimination now than formerly in this disease. Blood\\r\\ntests, etc., aid in telling when an operation is necessary in acute cases.\\r\\nThere is very little danger in a chronic case if the operation is done\\r\\nduring the interval of the attacks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCATARACT.--The operation for this trouble is gloriously successful and the\\r\\nblind are daily recovering their sight through this operation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMASTOID.--Operations on the Mastoid cells are frequently performed now and\\r\\nsave many lives. When there is swelling behind the ear or there is much\\r\\npain there a careful examination should be made. Chronic cases of Mastoid\\r\\ndisease usually demand this operation.\\r\\n\\r\\n[664 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nOVARIES, TUMORS OF THE.--The operation for tumors is very successful. If\\r\\nthe ovary is simply enlarged by congestion, medicine will frequently\\r\\nreduce it; but when the enlargement is due to a tumor, it should be\\r\\nremoved if it continues to enlarge. Sometimes there is cancer of the\\r\\novary. If so, it should be operated upon early. Tumors of the womb, such\\r\\nas fibroids, are often observed. They sometimes require removal if they\\r\\ngrow large. The symptoms will indicate when an operation is needed. These\\r\\ntumors often grow so large as to necessitate the removal of the womb.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPERINEUM AND CERVIX.--The perineum and cervix are sometimes torn during\\r\\nlabor and should be immediately repaired. The perineum is the support for\\r\\nthe organs of generation and if it is not solid the ovaries, tubes, womb\\r\\nand vagina will sag and fall. Neglect of this simple operation at the\\r\\nproper time results in backaches, headaches, etc. Many women have suffered\\r\\nfor years and doctored for other complaints when proper attention to the\\r\\nreal trouble would have saved all that expense and pain. Your physician\\r\\nshould be requested, in advance, to attend before he leaves to any\\r\\nlaceration that may occur during labor. At this time it causes little or\\r\\nno pain. If postponed until next day or later it would be painful and\\r\\nrequire an anesthetic. Many cases of cancer are caused by neglected\\r\\nlacerations.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPILES.--It is often necessary to operate both for external and internal\\r\\npiles. The result is usually complete relief and cure.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCANCERS.--Cancers should be operated on early. A sore on the womb, lip or\\r\\ntongue, or lump on the breast that continues for a little time without\\r\\ngetting better, is dangerous. It may soon spread in the surrounding tissue\\r\\nand general system. Operations on the womb and breast, performed in time,\\r\\nare very successful. Such tumors or sores should not be neglected. A lump\\r\\nin the breast should be examined early. The womb should be examined if\\r\\nthere is a discharge from the vagina that continues. In such a case the\\r\\nfamily doctor can determine what should be done. A sore on the lip,\\r\\ntongue, face, etc., that continues and refuses to heal should cause\\r\\nsuspicion and be shown to a physician.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPLEURISY.--\"Water in the chest\" sometimes follows pleurisy. This, if not\\r\\nabsorbed, must be drawn off and is quite easily done. After some cases of\\r\\npneumonia the lung does not clear up properly and pus forms in it. An\\r\\noperation is sometimes necessary to evacuate it. This should be performed\\r\\nbefore the patient becomes very much exhausted. Some people allow it to\\r\\ncontinue too long and thus lessen the chances of recovery when an\\r\\noperation is at last performed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSQUINT.--There is no need for any person being cross-eyed if attention is\\r\\nearly given to the trouble. Sometimes properly fitted glasses will correct\\r\\nthis trouble, but an operation is often necessary and is very successful\\r\\nand not serious or painful.\\r\\n\\r\\n[OPERATIONS 665]\\r\\n\\r\\nTRACHEOTOMY AND INTUBATION.--The operation of tracheotomy, opening of the\\r\\nwind-pipe, is performed where there is choking from a foreign body in the\\r\\nwind-pipe or when it has become suddenly closed in diseases such as croup\\r\\nand diphtheria. It is always an emergency operation and is only resorted\\r\\nto when it is evident that unless severe measures are taken the patient\\r\\nwill choke to death. Intubation is more frequently practised in disease\\r\\nwhen the breathing has become difficult owing to the growth of membrane in\\r\\nthe larynx. A tube of the proper size is placed in the wind-pipe and\\r\\nallowed to remain there until the disease has lost its force and the\\r\\nmembrane no longer obstructs the air passage. This tube allows the patient\\r\\nto breathe freely as it furnishes an opening for the air and an attendant\\r\\nnotices the change immediately. Intubation should be performed before the\\r\\npatient has become weak.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTONSILS.--A person who is subject to enlarged tonsils should watch them\\r\\ncarefully. If they contain pus for any length of time they should be\\r\\nremoved, for they not only obstruct the breathing, but are a menace to the\\r\\nhealth. Enucleation is usually the best method of removal. Enucleation\\r\\nmeans the operation of extracting a tumor in entirety after opening its\\r\\nsac, but without further cutting. Removal of the tonsils is a simple\\r\\noperation, usually not requiring the use of anesthetics and most\\r\\nphysicians advise the removal of an enlarged or troublesome tonsil.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCALCULI OR STONES.--Calculi or stones are removed from the gall bladder,\\r\\ngall ducts, kidneys, ureter and bladder by operations, when it has been\\r\\nascertained that the patient cannot \"pass them.\" Many physicians prefer to\\r\\nlocate the calculus by use of the X-rays before deciding to operate, and\\r\\nthere can be no doubt as to the wisdom of this. In these, as in all\\r\\noperations, success depends largely upon the general condition of the\\r\\npatient. They are not considered dangerous operations, but the final\\r\\ndecision as to their necessity should rest, in each case, with a competent\\r\\nphysician or surgeon.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nKIDNEYS, STOMACH, PROSTATE, ETC.--Little can be said in this brief\\r\\nparagraph concerning the many operations that are now performed upon the\\r\\ndifferent organs. What applies to one applies, in general, to all.\\r\\nOperations are now performed, and successfully, for pus in the kidney,\\r\\nfloating kidney, etc. Ulcers and cancers are removed from the stomach and\\r\\nreproductive organs. In some cases it has been necessary to remove the\\r\\norgans in their entirety. Pieces of the intestines have been removed with\\r\\ngratifying results in cases of ulcers and injuries. Enlarged prostate\\r\\nnearly always necessitates an operation before relief can be expected. It\\r\\nis impossible here to say much concerning the chances for recovery in each\\r\\nindividual case, since they are decided by the strength and temperament of\\r\\nthe patient, the care and skill of the surgeon and nurses, and whether the\\r\\npatient has submitted to the operation soon enough in the course of the\\r\\ndisease. Let it suffice here to say that the majority of the\\r\\nabove-mentioned operations are successful and result in the relief and\\r\\noften the complete recovery of the patient.\\r\\n\\r\\n[666 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE HOT SPRINGS OF ARKANSAS.\\r\\n\\r\\nGovernment Ownership.--The ownership and control of the Hot Springs of\\r\\nArkansas by the United States Government is absolute, and its endorsement\\r\\nof them for the treatment of certain ailments is unequivocal. After due\\r\\ninvestigation, congress took possession of the springs in the year 1832,\\r\\nand it retained around them a reservation ample to protect them from all\\r\\nencroachments, It was the first National park reservation of the country.\\r\\nThey are set apart by this act as \"A National Sanitarium for all time,\"\\r\\nand \"dedicated to the people of the United States to be forever free from\\r\\nsale or alienation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Army and Navy Hospital at Hot Springs.--In the year 1883 the United\\r\\nStates Government built a hospital known as the army and navy hospital at\\r\\nHot Springs, Arkansas, on the Southwestern slope, near the base of Hot\\r\\nSprings mountain, since which time the soldiers and sailors of the army\\r\\nand navy have been sent there for treatment for such ailments as the\\r\\nwaters may reasonably be expected to cure, or relieve. In his circular for\\r\\nthe guidance of the officers of the army in sending the sick there, the\\r\\nsurgeon-general of the United States enumerates the ailments for which the\\r\\nsick should be sent to the army and navy hospital at the Hot Springs. It\\r\\nsays, \"Relief may be reasonably expected at the Hot Springs in the\\r\\nfollowing conditions: In the various forms of gout and rheumatism after\\r\\nthe acute or inflammatory stage; neuralgia, especially when depending upon\\r\\ngout; rheumatism, metallic, or malarial poisonings, paralysis, not of\\r\\norganic origin; the earlier stages of locomotor ataxia; chronic Bright\\'s\\r\\ndisease (early stages only), and other diseases of the urinary organs;\\r\\nfunctional diseases of the liver; gastric dyspepsia, not of the organic\\r\\norigin; chronic diarrhea; catarrhal affections of the digestive and\\r\\nrespiratory tracts; chronic skin diseases, especially the squamous\\r\\nvarieties, and chronic conditions due to malarial infection.\"\\r\\n      Approved,       GEO.

No\\r\\nbaths will be supplied except on written applications made on blanks\\r\\nfurnished at the office of the bath house, making full answer to the\\r\\nquestions therein propounded: then if the applicant is found to be\\r\\nindigent, in accordance with the common acceptations of the word, the\\r\\nmanager will issue a ticket good for twenty-one baths, which may be\\r\\nreissued on the same application if necessary. The daily average of baths\\r\\ngiven at the free bath house for the year 1909 was more than six hundred.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe government is very broad and liberal in construing the meaning of the\\r\\nword indigent; and the fact that the applicant for free baths has some\\r\\nproperty, seems not to act as a bar to the privilege of free baths. Ninety\\r\\nper cent of the patients admitted to the Army and Navy Hospital are either\\r\\ncured or relieved. Taking into consideration the large number of old civil\\r\\nwar veterans treated at the hospital, whose ailments have become chronic,\\r\\nthis is a very remarkable showing.\\r\\n\\r\\nPhysicians\\' and Medical Regulations.--The United States Government,\\r\\nthrough the interior department, regulates and controls the practice of\\r\\nmedicine in connection with the hot waters. A local federal medical board\\r\\npasses on the applications of physicians who wish to prescribe the hot\\r\\nwaters. All who meet the requirements of the board are placed on the\\r\\naccredited list. Copies of this list are hung in all the bath houses and\\r\\nonly those whose names appear thereon are permitted to prescribe the hot\\r\\nwaters. For the benefit of visitors these lists are also kept at the\\r\\noffice of the superintendent of the reservation near the Army and Navy\\r\\nHospital. These regulations apply only to those who take medical\\r\\ntreatment. Others get the baths without formalities of any kind. In\\r\\naddition to the Army and Navy hospital and the government free bath house,\\r\\nthere are twenty-five bath houses operated by private parties, eleven of\\r\\nwhich are situated along the western base of Hot Springs mountains on the\\r\\ngovernment reservation, and fourteen are on private property at various\\r\\nother points throughout the city. The relations of all the bath houses to\\r\\nthe government are the same. They each pay the water rental to the\\r\\nInterior Department of the United States. The government\\'s interests are\\r\\nlooked after by a superintendent of the reservation, who is appointed by\\r\\nthe President of the United States. He has charge of all improvements\\r\\ngoing on, on the reservation and enforces all government rules and\\r\\nregulations concerning the bath houses.\\r\\n\\r\\n[668 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nCost of Living at Hot Springs.--Hot Springs is not located in a good\\r\\nagricultural section, and it is not a manufacturing city; therefore, the\\r\\nboarding and lodging of visitors is their only source of income. Upon\\r\\nnearly every house in the city is displayed the notice that board is\\r\\nfurnished, or furnished rooms are for rent, with or without light\\r\\nhousekeeping. A few places furnish board and lodging for $4.50 per week;\\r\\nthe most general charge, however, is from $5.00 to $6.00 per week. Renting\\r\\nrooms, arranged for light housekeeping, is the cheapest method of living\\r\\nat Hot Springs. The above prices are intended to show the minimum cost of\\r\\nliving.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhere to obtain additional reliable information relating to baths, board,\\r\\netc., at Hot Springs, Arkansas.--First. Apply to the superintendent of the\\r\\nUnited States reservation, corner of Central and Reserve Avenues, Hot\\r\\nSprings.\\r\\n\\r\\nSecond. The business men of the city have an organization known as the\\r\\n\"Business Men\\'s League,\" which is intended and prepared to furnish\\r\\nreliable information by letter or personal application to the secretary\\r\\nand managers of the Business Men\\'s League. Persons visiting Hot Springs\\r\\nshould not rely upon advice, information, or propositions from strangers\\r\\neither on the train or in the city.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMEDICAL USES OF SOME COMMON HOUSEHOLD ARTICLES.\\r\\n\\r\\nSALT (Sodium Chloride).--This common household article is used in a great\\r\\nmany different ways. In cooking it is used to season foods. The absence of\\r\\nsalt gives rise to a bad state of the system, with the formation of\\r\\nintestinal worms. If used too freely, it produces in some persons excess\\r\\nof blood and corpulency. Salt renders the food more palatable in many\\r\\ninstances and thus increases the flow of the gastric juice. Salt increases\\r\\nthe flow of saliva also. For pin-worms, solution of salt injected is often\\r\\neffective.\\r\\n\\r\\nConstipation.--One teaspoonful to a glass of water taken on arising is\\r\\nvery good for some people troubled with constipation. For dyspepsia it\\r\\ntones the stomach and aids in digestion in some cases. Salt alone in\\r\\nteaspoonful doses will produce vomiting and is good after a spree or to\\r\\nempty the stomach in convulsions and poisoning. Mustard given with it\\r\\nmakes it more effective. A salt solution is frequently injected into the\\r\\nrectum to keep up the strength after operating and it is also frequently\\r\\nput into the breast for same purpose.\\r\\n\\r\\nA gargle and astringent in sore throat. For this purpose it is often of\\r\\nuse and successful. Taken dry in teaspoonful doses it is often given in\\r\\nbleeding from the lungs. It is often used as an antiseptic to cleanse\\r\\nsores and wounds. Teaspoonful to a half pint of water. On bites of insects\\r\\nstrong salt water or applied dry is often very good. In bites of snakes\\r\\nand animals dry salt applied freely upon the wound is often of value. It\\r\\ndraws away some of the poison and also helps to burn out and cleanse the\\r\\nwound.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFomentations.--Used in this way it is good for sprains and bruises.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBaths.--One pound of salt to four gallons of water forms a suitable salt\\r\\nwater bath acting as a tonic and excitant to the skin.\\r\\n\\r\\n[MEDICAL USES OF COMMON ARTICLES 669]\\r\\n\\r\\nAgue.--Homeopathic doctors claim that salt in the attenuations will cure\\r\\nsome cases of ague.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbuse of Salt.--Too much use of salt will cause a great many troubles. It\\r\\nproduces a peculiar eruption on the skin, sore eyes, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nWant of Salt.--Domestic animals need it and may die for the want of it.\\r\\nSome animals may become sterile if deprived of it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLEMON.--Lemons, owing to their pleasant flavor and agreeable acidity, are\\r\\nvery useful in a sick room. The rind yields an oil of great fragrancy.\\r\\nEach lemon yields two to eight drams of acidulous juice and contains seven\\r\\nto nine per cent of citric acid, besides phosphoric and malic acids, in\\r\\ncombination with potassa and other bases. Half an ounce of lemon juice\\r\\nshould neutralize twenty-five grains of bicarbonate of potassium, twenty\\r\\ngrains of bicarbonate of soda or fourteen grains of carbonate of ammonia.\\r\\nThe rind of lemon when fresh, besides the oil above mentioned, contains a\\r\\nbitter crystalline glucoside.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHesperidin.--Uses. Lemon juice applied to the surface of the skin removes\\r\\nfreckles, moth spots, sunburn, pruritus, and ink-stains.\\r\\n\\r\\nInternally.--This is a very good remedy to cure scurvy. It is a constant\\r\\ncompanion of sea-goers and scurvy is seldom seen when the regulation\\r\\nration of lemon-juice is used regularly. It also cures the scurvy skin\\r\\ntrouble or the form of muscular pains felt in scurvy.\\r\\n\\r\\nChronic Rheumatism.--In some cases several ounces of lemon-juice\\r\\nadministered daily affords marked relief, and it is also sometimes useful\\r\\nin acute rheumatism. Lemonade is a useful drink during convalescence, as\\r\\nit increases the urine and reduces its acidity.\\r\\n\\r\\nHot lemonade is useful as a sweating agent to break up colds in their\\r\\nbeginning. It satisfies the thirst and is very grateful to a stomach that\\r\\nis not normal. It makes a very pleasant drink in many cases of sickness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nONION (Allium Cepa).--It is supposed that the onion is a native of\\r\\nHungary. It is now found over the whole civilized world. It contains a\\r\\nwhite, acrid, volatile oil holding sulphur in solution, albumen, much\\r\\nuncrystallizable sugar and mucilage, phosphoric acid both free and\\r\\ncombined with lime, citrate of lime. The Spanish onion contains a large\\r\\nproportion of sulphur and thus may be satisfactorily used in those cases\\r\\nwhere sulphur is needed. The action of the volatile oil enhances that of\\r\\nsulphur. Spanish onion boiled and eaten freely at bed-time is an excellent\\r\\nlaxative. Moderately used the onion increases the appetite, promotes\\r\\ndigestion, but in large quantities it causes flatulence, uneasiness in the\\r\\nstomach and bowels. The juice mixed with sugar is useful in cough, colds,\\r\\nand croup where there is little inflammation. Roasted or split it is\\r\\nexcellent as a local application in croup, tonsilitis and earache. Boiling\\r\\ndeprives the onion of its essential oil.\\r\\n\\r\\n[670 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nSODA (Bicarbonate of Soda).--Uses. It is used in stomach fermentation and\\r\\nin sick headaches arising from this condition. Useful in acidity of the\\r\\nstomach. Good for gas in the stomach. It is good as a local application to\\r\\nenlarged acute tonsils applied in powder. It is also used in preparing\\r\\ndifferent articles of food. The best to get is the bicarbonate of soda at\\r\\na drug store.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSULPHUR.--This is an important constituent in certain native mineral\\r\\nwaters. On the bowels it acts as a mild laxative. It is very good in\\r\\ncertain skin diseases and for itch in the form of an ointment it is often\\r\\nused. It is useful in chronic acne, and for lice, itch, barber\\'s itch,\\r\\netc. It is frequently used as a disinfectant after infectious diseases.\\r\\nBurning sulphur in a room destroys bed-bugs, chicken lice, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTURPENTINE (Terebinthina).--Uses. It is a valuable counter-irritant in\\r\\nperitonitis, bronchitis, pneumonia, lumbago, pleurodynia, etc. Turpentine\\r\\nstupes are frequently used in abdominal inflammation, for flatulence and\\r\\nfor bloating in typhoid fever. It is a valuable constituent of a great\\r\\nmany liniments. Used in excess it produces bloody urine, painful urination\\r\\nand inflammation of the kidneys. The free use of barley water, hot bath\\r\\nand purgative relieve its bad effects.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nVASELIN.--Under the name of Petrolatum is sold a semi-solid substance\\r\\nderived from certain kinds of petroleum called cosmoline or vaselin. It\\r\\nhas very soothing powers and does not become rancid and is used as a\\r\\nsoothing dressing in sores, boils, and skin affections. It is frequently\\r\\nused as a base for ointments. Fluid or liquid petrolatum is much used now\\r\\nin the form of a spray in the treatment of acute and chronic catarrh and\\r\\nafter irritant applications to the nasal cavities. It is put up now in\\r\\ntubes and is much cleaner and purer. It is very soothing and healing when\\r\\nused in this pure form.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nALCOHOL (Spirit of Wine).--Alcohol is a liquid composed of ninety-one per\\r\\ncent by weight of ethylic alcohol and of nine per cent by weight of water.\\r\\nAlcohol dissolves alkaloids, fatty and resinous substances, and is largely\\r\\nused as a menstruum in obtaining the active principles of drugs in an\\r\\navailable form for administration. It is the basis for spirits, tinctures\\r\\nand elixirs; spirits being solutions of volatile substances in alcohol;\\r\\ntinctures, solutions of active principles of plants, generally obtained by\\r\\nmaceration and percolation. An elixir is a cordial flavored with orange\\r\\nand syrup, used as a vehicle for other remedies and as a stomachic.\\r\\n\\r\\nIts action is very extensive. It is used extensively in medical\\r\\npreparations. It is a good application to prevent bed-sores. The addition\\r\\nof one dram of alum to a pint makes it more effective. Hot applications\\r\\nrelieve pain in face neuralgia, cold in the face or toothache. It is often\\r\\nused after bathing in full strength or diluted to rub on the body to\\r\\nprevent taking cold. It stimulates the digestive organs, nervous system\\r\\nand the circulation. It is much used in snake-bite. Its constant use is a\\r\\nmenace, as all know. It should never be taken for disease unless\\r\\nprescribed by a reputable physician.\\r\\n\\r\\n[MEDICAL USES OF COMMON ARTICLES 671]\\r\\n\\r\\nALUM (Alumen).--Dried alum is an astringent and mild \"burner\" for growths\\r\\nsuch as \"proud flesh.\" The glycerite of alum is useful in tonsilitis or\\r\\npharyngitis when it is not acute. In solution it condenses tissue by\\r\\ncoagulating their albumin and acts as an astringent.\\r\\n\\r\\nUses of the Strength.--One dram to a pint of whisky and water aids in\\r\\nchecking sweating in consumption when applied with a sponge. It is a good\\r\\ninjection for the whites. A cotton plug soaked in alum often stops\\r\\nnosebleed by inserting it in the nostrils, or a solution may be thrown or\\r\\nsnuffed into the nostrils. It is also good as a gargle for tonsilitis and\\r\\nsore throat.\\r\\n\\r\\nEmetic for Croup.--Put a heaping teaspoonful in thirty-two teaspoonfuls of\\r\\nwater or syrup and give a teaspoonful every fifteen minutes until vomiting\\r\\nis produced. It is often used stronger when quick action is desired. It is\\r\\na mild astringent and thus used to check mucous discharges from the\\r\\nbowels, etc. Burnt powdered alum is often used to destroy \"proud flesh.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBORAX (Sodium Borate).--This drug as it appears in commerce of America is\\r\\nderived entirely from natural deposits found on the shores of lakes of\\r\\nCalifornia and Nevada. This is purified.\\r\\n\\r\\nAction.--It is antiseptic in its action. It renders the urine alkaline.\\r\\n\\r\\nGargle.--It is used as a gargle in sore mouth and throat in dose of a dram\\r\\nto a pint of water. It is very good used as a wash for fetid sweating,\\r\\nespecially of the feet. It is often used in combination in catarrh of the\\r\\nnose. It can be combined with soda for this purpose in dose of one dram of\\r\\neach to two pints of pure water and used in an atomizer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCAMPHOR.--This is distilled from the wood and bark of the camphor tree,\\r\\ncinnamomum camphora, which grows chiefly in China and Japan. It should be\\r\\nkept in closed bottles.\\r\\n\\r\\nUses.--It is good for cold in the head in the early stages. It may be\\r\\nsnuffed up the nostrils in fine powder, or put in boiling water and the\\r\\nfumes inhaled. It is good used as a liniment in neuralgia, stiff neck,\\r\\nrheumatism and for boils and sores. Used in the form of camphor ice it is\\r\\nvery good for sores, cuts, boils, etc. It is often of use to smell when\\r\\none feels faint. It is one of the ingredients in many liniments. Its\\r\\nexternal use as spirits of camphor is extensive.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCASTOR OIL (Oleum Ricini).--This is derived from the beans of Ricinis\\r\\nCommunis, a plant in the United States.\\r\\n\\r\\nAction.--It is bland and unirritating in its action as a purge and\\r\\ngenerally acts in four to five hours.\\r\\n\\r\\nUses.--It is used whenever irritant materials such as bad food, putrid\\r\\nflesh, decaying vegetables have been eaten, to move the bowels. It is good\\r\\nin diarrhea produced by above causes and others, such as corn, peanuts,\\r\\ncherry stones, berries. It is apt to produce piles and constipation if\\r\\nused constantly. It is often given in the form of capsules containing from\\r\\none-fourth to one teaspoonful. Dip the capsules in water, as this renders\\r\\nthem slippery and are easily swallowed. Dose is from one to six\\r\\nteaspoonfuls.\\r\\n\\r\\n[672 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nOLIVE OIL. Sweet Oil (Oleum Olivae).--This is expressed from the ripe\\r\\nfruit.\\r\\n\\r\\nAction and Uses.--It is a lubricant. It is added to poultices as an\\r\\nemollient in pneumonia and skin diseases.

It is useful in dyspepsia of aged persons and also\\r\\ngood in flatulence and diarrhea. For menstrual cramps, due to suppression\\r\\nfrom exposure to cold it is useful as a warm tea and also for colds. It is\\r\\nalso used in the spice plasters.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHONEY (Mel).--This is a saccharine fluid deposited in combs by the honey\\r\\nbee (Apis Mellifica).\\r\\n\\r\\nAction: It is slightly laxative and a pleasant article of food. Honey and\\r\\nwater is used as a gargle and to relieve cough, dryness of the mouth and\\r\\nfauces. When used as a gargle it increases the secretion of the mucous\\r\\nmembrane and so relieves the congestion. It is apt to disorder the stomach\\r\\nwhen used too freely. Honey mixed with lemon juice and water is very good\\r\\nfor a cough, especially the tickling kind.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLARD (Adeps).--This is a common household article known to all. It is\\r\\nfrequently used as the basis for ointments and cerates and in domestic\\r\\npractice as a lubricant. Tincture benzoin added to it prevents it from\\r\\nbecoming rancid. It can be used in corrosive poisoning as an antidote\\r\\nexcept where phosporus and carbolic acid have been swallowed. It is also\\r\\nused in preparing articles of food. It has more penetrating power than\\r\\npetrolatum or vaselin. Washed lard, beaten up with an equal quantity of\\r\\nlime-water, and a few drops of oil of bitter almond, thymol, or carbolic\\r\\nacid added, is splendid for burns; stiffened with yellow wax it forms the\\r\\nsimple ointment often used. It softens the hard skin and reduces its heat,\\r\\nwhen the natural secretion is suppressed. It also softens and removes\\r\\nscabs and lessens and prevents the effect of irritant discharges. The\\r\\nsimple lard ointment relieves the intense heat and itching of the skin in\\r\\nscarlet fever. Dissolved and given in large doses it causes nausea and\\r\\nvomiting.\\r\\n\\r\\n[MEDICAL USES OF COMMON ARTICLES 673]\\r\\n\\r\\nMUSTARD (Sinapis).--Mustard flour, two tablespoonfuls to a glass of water,\\r\\nacts as an emetic. If given largely it produces violent gastritis, and\\r\\nchronic gastritis is often set up by its constant use in excess. It should\\r\\nnot be used in acute dyspepsia and bowel irritation.\\r\\n\\r\\nExternal: It is applied for colic due to flatulence and for acute\\r\\ninflammation of different organs and is also good when applied to the nape\\r\\nof the neck in headache, neuralgia, etc. Lint soaked in limewater and\\r\\nolive oil relieves the excessive burning from the plaster. Mustard foot\\r\\nbaths made by using one handful of ground mustard to half pail of hot\\r\\nwater is useful in colds, sleeplessness, headache, convulsions,\\r\\ndysmenorrhea.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCREAM OF TARTAR (Potassii bitartras).--Uses: It is useful in kidney\\r\\ndiseases to remove dropsy. In large doses of four teaspoonfuls it acts as\\r\\na watery purge. It is useful where the urine is thick and alkaline to make\\r\\nit clear and normal. It is sometimes combined in equal parts with epsom\\r\\nsalts to move the bowels, especially when an action on the kidneys is also\\r\\nnecessary. It is given in teaspoonful doses before breakfast for prickly\\r\\nheat; it is cooling to the blood and is one of the old home remedies.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nVINEGAR (Acetic Acid).--Vinegar contains from six to seven per cent acetic\\r\\nacid. Dilute acetic acid contains six per cent pure acetic acid. The pure\\r\\nor glacial acetic acid is a crystalline solid at 59 degrees F., takes up\\r\\nmoisture readily so should be kept in well stoppered bottles. Acetic acid\\r\\nis a strong corrosive poison; if taken internally, causes vomiting, with\\r\\nintense pain, followed by convulsions and fatal coma. If the acid remains\\r\\nin the stomach for some time it may eat its way through the stomach wall.\\r\\nIn cases of poisoning by acetic acid, milk or flour and water should be\\r\\nfreely given and vomiting produced. Weak alkalies should also be given as\\r\\nantidotes. Glacial acetic acid is used as an application to cancer of the\\r\\nskin, ulcers, warts, growths in the nose, ringworm, lupus (Jacob\\'s Ulcer)\\r\\nand other ulcerous growths. Vinegar or dilute acetic acid is given to\\r\\ncheck night sweats and to relieve diarrhea. It is also used in treating\\r\\npainter\\'s colic after the constipation has been relieved, as an antidote\\r\\nto poisoning by caustic alkalies; externally to prevent bed sores,\\r\\nrelieves headaches, checks moderate bleeding from leech bites, superficial\\r\\nwounds, nosebleed and in post-partum hemorrhage. It inhibits the growth of\\r\\nmicro-organisms. Cases of catarrhal, membranous and diphtheric croup are\\r\\nbenefited by the vapor of vinegar diffused through the sick room. A\\r\\ncompress saturated in vinegar and placed over the nose until consciousness\\r\\nreturns is recommended to prevent or relieve vomiting, nausea and headache\\r\\nfollowing the inhalation of chloroform.\\r\\n\\r\\n[676 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nUNCLASSIFIED MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES\\r\\n\\r\\nReceived Too Late to Place in Proper Departments\\r\\n\\r\\nBurns, Lime Water and Sweet Oil for.--\"Put unslaked lime about the size of\\r\\na hen\\'s egg in three pints of water and strain; add one cup of sweet oil,\\r\\nshake and keep burn moist.

ELIZABETH JOHNSTONE\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The small courtesies sweeten life, the greater ennoble it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe social code which we call etiquette is no senseless formula. It has a\\r\\nmeaning and a purpose. It is the expression of good manners, and good\\r\\nmanners have been rightly called the minor morals. This is true in the\\r\\nsense that they are the expression of the innate kindness and good will\\r\\nthat sum up what we call good breeding. As to its importance, Sir Walter\\r\\nScott once said that a man might with more impunity be guilty of an actual\\r\\nbreach of good morals than appear ignorant of the points of etiquette.\\r\\n\\r\\n[684 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery social custom has a foundation established by usage as a recognition\\r\\nof social needs, and intended to prevent rudeness and confusion; intended\\r\\nalso to make polite society polite. We must conform, according to our\\r\\ncircle, to social conventions as thus established, since they are the\\r\\nripened results of long and varied experience in what is most suitable and\\r\\nbecoming. Not to observe them is to advertise our ignorance and expose\\r\\nourselves to criticism.\\r\\n\\r\\nImportance of Knowledge.--That the importance of a knowledge of social\\r\\ncustoms is widely felt is proved by the pathetic letters addressed to the\\r\\neditors of women\\'s magazines and departments, asking for information to\\r\\nenlighten ignorance. Such letters range from the naive inquiry of the\\r\\nunsophisticated girl as to whether it is \"proper\" to allow her \"gentleman\\r\\nfriend\" to kiss her good night, up to the plaint of the novice who doesn\\'t\\r\\nknow how to make her spoons and forks come out even at a dinner-party.\\r\\nHere in America, where circumstances may lift a family from poverty and\\r\\nobscurity to wealth, with a position to win in a few brief years, the\\r\\nfirst great anxiety of those not \"to the manor born\" is to learn how to\\r\\ncomport themselves in their new situation, and educate their children in\\r\\ncorrect behavior.\\r\\n\\r\\nGood manners are a necessary equipment of both men and women. In many\\r\\ncircles, success is impossible without such equipment. An agreeable\\r\\nmanner, a knowledge of what to do and when to do it, is indispensable to\\r\\nthe woman in society, and any man who meets other men in a business way\\r\\nwill willingly bear testimony to the reluctance with which he approaches\\r\\nthe gruff, brusque man, whose manners are patterned after those of Ursa\\r\\nMajor. The man whose manners are agreeable may be as ugly as Caliban, yet\\r\\nplease everybody.\\r\\n\\r\\nMoreover, there is no weapon so effective against the rude and\\r\\nill-mannered as a calm politeness--a courtesy which marks the person who\\r\\ncan practise it as superior to the one who cannot. For one\\'s own peace of\\r\\nmind, one should learn the art of good manners.\\r\\n\\r\\nA Matter of Habit.--Manners, like everything else in life, must be learned\\r\\nby rule, the only possible exception being in the case of those who have\\r\\nbeen brought up in what we call our best society, where what to do and how\\r\\nto dress and behave have been matters of habit from earliest childhood.\\r\\nWhen once the rules of etiquette are firmly fixed, they become instinctive\\r\\nand are obeyed unconsciously. The individual then has \"good manners.\" No\\r\\none can be easy and graceful who must stop to think how to do things.\\r\\nFamiliarity with form breeds ease and grace of manner. Therefore those who\\r\\nwould be letter perfect must practise the rules of good form at all times\\r\\nand places. Manners cannot be put on and off like a garment. Moreover, as\\r\\nhas just been said, the politeness that comes of such observance is the\\r\\nbest possible armor against the rudeness or boorishness of the ignorant\\r\\nand untrained.\\r\\n\\r\\n[MANNERS AND SOCIAL CUSTOMS 685]\\r\\n\\r\\nMany books on etiquette are written, most of which are intended for those\\r\\nin fashionable society who have a number of servants and entertain both\\r\\nextensively and expensively. Other writers take too much for granted; they\\r\\npresuppose a knowledge of the subject which the novice who needs\\r\\ninstruction does not possess. This department is intended for those who\\r\\ndesire to add to their knowledge of social forms, who do not wish to\\r\\nappear ignorant and awkward, and who, in a more limited social sphere,\\r\\nstill wish to entertain properly and pleasantly, and comport themselves in\\r\\ncorrect form.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCONCERNING INTRODUCTIONS.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first and most positive rule in regard to introductions is that a man\\r\\nis introduced to a woman; never the reverse, no matter how distinguished\\r\\nthe man may be.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe best form is the simplest. \"Mrs. A., allow me to introduce Mr. B.\" If\\r\\nthe introduction has been solicited, the hostess may say \"Mrs. A., Mr. B.\\r\\ndesires the honor of knowing you.\" If either party resides in another\\r\\ncity, she may mention the fact, or any other little circumstance that may\\r\\naid the two to enter into conversation. The woman does not rise when a man\\r\\nis introduced, but if she is standing may offer her hand. To say \"How do\\r\\nyou do\" is much better form than \"Glad to know you\" or \"Pleased to meet\\r\\nyou,\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe person who performs an introduction should be careful to choose an\\r\\nopportune moment. Do not interrupt a conversation to introduce another\\r\\nparty, unless, as hostess, you feel it has continued so long that it is\\r\\ntime the talk became more general. It is not courteous to simply\\r\\nacknowledge an introduction, and not exchange a few words.\\r\\n\\r\\nWomen and Introductions.--In introducing women, the younger is introduced\\r\\nto the older; if nearly of the same age a distinction is immaterial. Young\\r\\ngirls are introduced to matrons, and the younger matrons to those older.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf a woman is seated when another woman is introduced she should rise and\\r\\noffer her hand, and then invite the new acquaintance to a seat near her\\r\\nwhere they may converse. If a man has been talking with the lady who\\r\\nrises, he should rise also and remain standing until they are seated, when\\r\\nhe may bow and take himself away unless requested to remain. Generally,\\r\\nthis is the proper moment to leave.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Calling.--If making a call, and another visitor enters, the lady of\\r\\nthe house rises to greet her and introduces any other guests who may be\\r\\npresent. A man must rise and find a scat for the newcomer, but the women\\r\\nbow without rising. If only one guest is present, she should rise if the\\r\\nhostess and latest caller remain standing, or if a change of seats seems\\r\\ndesirable. Introductions of this kind are semi-formal; they do not\\r\\nestablish a later acquaintance unless both are agreeable; the social\\r\\nintent is to bridge over a situation that might seem awkward. However,\\r\\nmany pleasant friendships have been made by such casual encounters at the\\r\\nhouse of a mutual friend.\\r\\n\\r\\n[686 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the other hand, if two women who are not on friendly terms happen thus\\r\\nto meet and are introduced, it would be a most grievous breach of\\r\\netiquette not to acknowledge the introduction courteously and exchange a\\r\\nremark or two. Neither has a right to embarrass a hostess by airing a\\r\\nprivate animosity under the roof of a friend--or in society generally.\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral lntroductions.--The only \"collective\" introduction possible is\\r\\nthat of a speaker or essayist to an audience. At a club meeting or other\\r\\nassemblage where a stranger is present as guest of honor, the members\\r\\nshould request the hostess or the president of the club to present them\\r\\nseverally.\\r\\n\\r\\nMen and lntroductions.--Men seldom ask introductions. They have the\\r\\nprivilege of speaking without them. A man\\'s title should always be given\\r\\nhim in an introduction. A man must request permission before bringing\\r\\nanother man to be introduced to a woman or to a friend\\'s house. In the\\r\\nlatter case he will present his companions to the lady of the house and\\r\\nany of the family who are present; if others arrive, the hostess should\\r\\nintroduce him to them.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter an introduction, the man waits for the woman to recognize him at\\r\\ntheir next meeting. She should bow, even if she does not care to establish\\r\\nan acquaintance. A casual introduction between women may not be recognized\\r\\nafterwards, though a slight bow is more courteous.\\r\\n\\r\\nA Few Things Not To Do.--Do not introduce a person as your \"\\'friend.\" It\\r\\nis not supposed you will introduce anyone who is not a friend. Moreover,\\r\\nin certain circles the term friend is employed in naming a companion,\\r\\nsecretary, governess or managing housekeeper to one\\'s guests. In this\\r\\nconnection it may be mentioned that one should not speak of \"visiting a\\r\\nfriend\" or \"staying at a friend\\'s house.\" Name the person referred to; or\\r\\nif you do not wish to do so, do not allude to the circumstance. Naturally,\\r\\none visits only friends.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe indistinctness with which people who introduce often pronounce a name\\r\\nis not infrequently the cause of awkwardness. The failure to hear is no\\r\\nfault on the part of those introduced, but rather a mishap chargeable to\\r\\nthe person who brings them together. In this case, try to think of\\r\\nsomething besides \"I didn\\'t catch the name;\" that is so cut and dried. Say\\r\\nrather, \"I\\'m sorry, but I didn\\'t understand Mrs. A. when she presented\\r\\nme.\" Forgetting a name in the act of introducing someone is a much more\\r\\ngrievous failure; it speaks for your own social unaccustomedness, and is a\\r\\npoor compliment to the person you introduce. Do not attempt an\\r\\nintroduction unless you are sure of your names.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the society woman\\'s most necessary accomplishments is the ability\\r\\nto remember names and fit them to the individual to whom they belong. It\\r\\nis an art she should sedulously cultivate.\\r\\n\\r\\n[MANNERS AND SOCIAL CUSTOMS 687]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is not etiquette, but misplaced politeness, to perform what may be\\r\\ntermed casual introductions--as in accidental encounters. Never introduce\\r\\non the street, unless your acquaintance is to join you. Don\\'t introduce in\\r\\na street car or any public conveyance. In \"our best\\r\\nsociety\"--so-called--it is not considered good form to introduce people in\\r\\nchurch. People do not go to church for social purposes. In village\\r\\nneighborhoods and the less fashionable city churches, this rule is often\\r\\nviolated in the vestibule, where acquaintances linger to greet each other\\r\\nand introductions are not infrequent. But in the body of the church--the\\r\\nspace set apart for purposes of worship--an introduction is wholly out of\\r\\nplace.\\r\\n\\r\\nTry to remember family relationships and feuds, that you may not attempt\\r\\nto introduce those at enmity with each other. A woman once introduced, at\\r\\na crowded function, two sisters who had not recognized each other for\\r\\nyears, and afterwards exulted in having \"made them speak.\" Their manners\\r\\nwere far superior to hers.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Company.--At a reception or dinner-party it is perfectly proper for\\r\\nthose who have never been introduced to converse with each other without\\r\\nsuch formality. The roof under which they meet confers the privilege.\\r\\nIndeed, it is often the greatest kindness to speak to a shy person or one\\r\\nwho evidently has few acquaintances present, relieving his embarrassment\\r\\nand putting him at ease. Not to reply courteously to such overtures is\\r\\ngreat rudeness. The story is told of a prominent society woman who\\r\\naddressed a stranger at such a function and actually received no reply.\\r\\nLater, the hostess brought up the strange person and introduced her. Then\\r\\nshe explained that, not having been properly introduced, she felt she\\r\\ncould not respond. The society woman quietly remarked, \"Oh, was that the\\r\\ntrouble? I thought you were deaf and dumb.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe late H. C. Bunner and the more recently deceased T. B. Aldrich\\r\\ncherished an aversion for each other. They were not acquainted, but\\r\\ndisliked each other on general principles, both being engaged in literary\\r\\nwork. They happened to meet at an entertainment where Bunner was in the\\r\\nhouse of his friends and Aldrich an outsider. Bunner\\'s native kindliness\\r\\nand courtesy made it impossible for him to see anyone uncomfortable in a\\r\\nfriend\\'s house. He introduced himself, carried Aldrich to his host\\'s\\r\\n\"den,\" and over a cigar and a glass of \"Scotch\" began a friendship that\\r\\nwas ended only by death.\\r\\n\\r\\nSchool Girls\\' Etiquette.--Etiquette is not so formal among school girls,\\r\\nthough its form remains the same. Propinquity in classes, and the being\\r\\nthrown together by mutual aims and interests, excuses informal\\r\\nfriendliness. In some women\\'s colleges there are what may be termed\\r\\n\"unwritten laws\"--school traditions--never set down in books but handed on\\r\\nfrom class to class. Thus a member of a lower class would not take\\r\\nprecedence of a Senior, either on entering or leaving a room, or at table.\\r\\nShe would introduce her friends, even her parents, to the Senior and to\\r\\nany member of the Faculty instead of the Senior to them. These little\\r\\nmatters of punctilio have to be learned by observation, or by the grace of\\r\\nsome friendly classmate who happens to be conversant with them.\\r\\n\\r\\n[688  MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nCARD AND CALLING ETIQUETTE.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor Women.--Card etiquette has been jocosely termed \"going into society in\\r\\na pasteboard way.\" Yet cards have a very essential part in the social\\r\\nregime. They are the expedient resorted to by the woman with a large\\r\\ncircle of acquaintances and many engagements, for keeping herself in mind.\\r\\n\\r\\nA card represents a visit, or acknowledges a courtesy in the way of an\\r\\ninvitation, There are well-defined rules which regulate the use of cards,\\r\\nfamiliarity with which is necessary to all who have social aspirations.\\r\\nAnd the questions most frequently asked by the novice relate to whom and\\r\\nwhen they should be sent or left.\\r\\n\\r\\nA General Rule.--Though calling has, in a degree, \"gone out of fashion,\"\\r\\nthe general rule is that a woman should call on her friends and\\r\\nacquaintances once a year. This signifies the desire to continue the\\r\\nrelationship. If she finds her friend at home she gives her name to the\\r\\nmaid and at the conclusion of the visit leaves her card on a table or some\\r\\nconvenient place. If her friend is out, the maid receives her card on a\\r\\ntray. In each case a visit has been paid and the card is a reminder that\\r\\nthe obligation has been discharged. At this call, if it is the first, or\\r\\nexpected to be the only one of the year, a married woman leaves one of her\\r\\ncards for each lady in the family, and one of her husband\\'s for each lady\\r\\nand one for the man of the house. One card, of her husband\\'s may include\\r\\nseveral grown daughters. If she calls again during the season, she may\\r\\nleave her own cards only, though she should acknowledge an invitation\\r\\nreceived by her husband by leaving his cards. Cards are never to be handed\\r\\nto the lady of the house or any member of the family.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Social Functions.--Now here is the law as regards leaving cards\\r\\nafter social functions: After receiving invitations to receptions,\\r\\ndinners, luncheons, card parties or evening entertainments, calls are to\\r\\nbe made within a week after the event, whether one has accepted or not.\\r\\nHowever, in some localities, it is thought correct to leave cards at the\\r\\ntime if one attends the function, or send them if not attending. It is\\r\\nsafest to ascertain the local custom in advance. The correct etiquette is\\r\\nto call afterwards.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn invitation to a church wedding necessitates sending cards to those in\\r\\nwhose name the invitation was issued and to the newly wedded pair. The\\r\\nsame is true of announcement cards. Cards for an afternoon tea do not\\r\\nrequire reply; those present leave their own cards and those of any member\\r\\nof the family who was invited but did not attend.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Absence.--Another use of cards is when one returns home after a long\\r\\nabsence. Cards with one\\'s address are sent to previous acquaintances, as a\\r\\nnotification that the sender wishes to resume her social relations. In\\r\\ncase of a friend\\'s illness, one should call to make personal inquiries,\\r\\nleaving a card on which is written \"To inquire.\" After a death, cards may\\r\\nbe left or sent, on which it is correct to write \"With sincere sympathy.\"\\r\\nAfter the funeral, cards are sent by those bereaved to those who have thus\\r\\nmanifested regard, with the words \"With thanks for kind inquiries\" or\\r\\nremembrances.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus we see cards are not meaningless, but indicate courtesy, kindly\\r\\ninterest and regard.\\r\\n\\r\\n[MANNERS AND SOCIAL CUSTOMS 689]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor Men.--Whereas the married man may discharge some of his social\\r\\nobligations through his wife, the bachelor has no such resource. In\\r\\nresponse to every invitation, accepted or otherwise, he must pay a visit,\\r\\nleaving cards. Unless he does this, his invitations will soon cease.\\r\\n\\r\\nA man may pay Sunday afternoon visits, as he is not supposed to be at\\r\\nleisure during the week. An evening call indicates greater intimacy. If he\\r\\ncalls upon a young lady he must leave two cards, one for her and one for\\r\\nher mother.\\r\\n\\r\\nLetters of Introduction--Letters of introduction are never presented in\\r\\nperson. The man must call and leave the letter, with his card, but on no\\r\\naccount enter the house. The next step is to be taken by the recipient of\\r\\nthe letter.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt a Hotel.--If a man calls on a lady at a hotel he sends up his card and\\r\\nwaits in a reception room. It is not permissible to write on his card the\\r\\nname of the member of the family whom he wishes to see. That is to be the\\r\\nsubject of later inquiry.\\r\\n\\r\\nStyles in Cards.--Styles in cards vary, both for men and women. Usually\\r\\nthe stationer will be a reliable guide as to size and style of engraving.\\r\\nA printed or written card should never be used, nor, according to strict\\r\\netiquette, should acceptances, regrets or informal invitations be written\\r\\non cards. Use note paper.\\r\\n\\r\\nA woman\\'s card should be of medium size and nearly square. Plain script,\\r\\nOld English or Roman are the only letterings used. Engraved plates, once\\r\\nobtained, may be used a long time. The street address, if used, is at the\\r\\nlower right-hand corner. This can be changed on one\\'s plate, if necessary,\\r\\nby ways known to the maker. Men\\'s cards are much smaller than women\\'s, and\\r\\nmust be engraved. The name is always prefaced by \"Mr.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nUse of Names.--A married woman uses her husband\\'s full name on her cards.\\r\\nA widow who happens to be the oldest representative of the family may have\\r\\nher cards engraved without her own or her husband\\'s name, as \"Mrs. Astor;\"\\r\\nthis signifies her place as social head of the family. A clergyman\\'s card\\r\\nmay have Rev. as a prefix; a physician\\'s Dr., never M. D. A young girl is\\r\\nalways Miss, and pet names are without social recognition. For a year\\r\\nafter she enters society a girl has her name engraved beneath her\\r\\nmother\\'s; where there are several daughters \"out,\" \"The Misses Smith\" may\\r\\nbe engraved under the mother\\'s name. A widow may act her pleasure as to\\r\\nusing her Christian name or her late husband\\'s on her card; the latter is\\r\\ncustomary. It would be a social convenience to use the Christian name, as\\r\\nwith the prefix \"Mrs.\" widowhood would be indicated.\\r\\n\\r\\n[690 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES ]\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE ETIQUETTE OF CALLS.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs has been said, a woman is expected to call on her friends once a year\\r\\nat least. The \"Day at Home\" has rather gone out of fashion. It imposed an\\r\\nobligation on the hostess which often proved irksome, interfering with\\r\\nengagements she might wish to make. If, however, one has \"a day,\" her\\r\\nfriends should so far as possible observe it.\\r\\n\\r\\nTime and Manner.--The time limit of a call is fifteen or twenty minutes,\\r\\nnot to exceed the latter. This is the protection society affords us from\\r\\nbores. We can endure even the most tiresome of visitors for fifteen\\r\\nminutes.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf one does not wish to see callers, the maid or whoever answers the door\\r\\nshould be so informed; the conventional \"Not at home\" being perfectly\\r\\nproper; it is merely a polite way of saying it is not convenient to\\r\\nreceive anyone. But for the maid to say \"I will see, if Mrs. A is at\\r\\nhome,\" and return to say she is not at home or not receiving, is a grave\\r\\ndiscourtesy. Nor should one keep a visitor waiting while she makes an\\r\\nelaborate toilette; better say \"Not at home.\" The call counts as a visit\\r\\nwhether the lady is at home or not, and must be returned. It is not\\r\\ncustomary to invite a visitor to be seated, to come again, or urge a\\r\\nlonger stay. It is supposed she will take the initiative in these\\r\\nparticulars; and too, that the fact that the two exchange visits warrants\\r\\na certain wontedness of habit. Still, among intimates it is by no means\\r\\nunusual for the hostess to say \"Do come again soon; I always enjoy you so\\r\\nmuch I should be glad to see more of you,\" or for the departing visitor to\\r\\nsay: \"I shall hope to have the pleasure of seeing you at my home soon.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMen\\'s Demeanor.--A man calling upon a lady either takes his hat and stick\\r\\ninto the reception room with him, or deposits them in the hall; she does\\r\\nnot instruct him what disposition to make of them. He removes his overcoat\\r\\nof his own volition, or retains it, as he pleases; the lady does not\\r\\nsuggest its removal. This is the strict letter of etiquette. As a matter\\r\\nof fact, many a man would feel snubbed, and the hostess that she failed in\\r\\ncordiality, if she failed to invite him to lay aside his coat. One must be\\r\\ngoverned by the customs of one\\'s circle. It is safe to say that unless it\\r\\nis a first call, which is the most formal, in our middle social stratum a\\r\\nman expects, if he is welcome, to be asked to remove his overcoat.\\r\\n\\r\\nA man waits for the woman to invite him to call, since it is her privilege\\r\\nto choose her acquaintances. Such an invitation should not be given too\\r\\nhastily, nor too soon after a first introduction. It is well not to show\\r\\ntoo much eagerness to cultivate the acquaintance, and the woman should be\\r\\nreasonably sure that the man is desirous of having the pleasure. If\\r\\ninvited, he should avail himself of the permission within a short time, by\\r\\nway of showing his appreciation of the compliment. Young girls do not\\r\\ninvite young men to call on them; this is their mother\\'s prerogative.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is more correct in these days when everyone has a telephone, to call up\\r\\nand inquire whether it will be convenient for the lady to receive callers,\\r\\nunless, of course, one is paying duty calls, in which case a card\\r\\ndischarges the obligation.\\r\\n\\r\\n[MANNERS AND SOCIAL CUSTOMS 691]\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pour Prendre Conge.\"--In taking leave, it is well not to wait until one\\r\\nhas exhausted the conversational gamut, and \"that awful pause\" in which\\r\\nneither seems to have anything to say, occurs. And having risen, do not\\r\\n\"stand upon the order of your going;\" do not linger for last words, or\\r\\nbegin a fresh topic at the door, keeping your hostess standing and perhaps\\r\\ndetaining her from other guests. \"Parting is such sweet sorrow\" in some\\r\\ncases that it becomes awkward and embarrassing because so prolonged.\\r\\nEspecially does it seem difficult for the youth who has not yet attained\\r\\nthe aplomb which makes him at ease in society, to \"tear himself away.\"\\r\\nRemember that a too abrupt departure, though regrettable, is better than\\r\\none too prolonged.\\r\\n\\r\\nGirls\\' Manners.--When the young girl accompanies her mother on a calling\\r\\nexpedition, she waits for the latter to take the initiative in regard to\\r\\ndeparture. She must allow the older person to precede her in entering and\\r\\nleaving, and she must be careful not to monopolize the conversation. Good\\r\\nmanners give precedence to age.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"P. p. c.\"--The social novice is sometimes puzzled by \"P. p. c.\" written\\r\\nin the lower corner of a card. The letters stand for the French phrase,\\r\\n\"Pour prendre conge\"--to take leave. Such cards are sent when one is to be\\r\\nabsent from home for a considerable period. They are left to be mailed\\r\\nafter departure. Thus the intending traveler is not incommoded by\\r\\nwell-meant but ill-timed calls at an hour when she is most busy. \"P. p.\\r\\nc.\" cards intimate the acquaintance is to be resumed on the sender\\'s\\r\\nreturn.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe custom of turning down the corner to signify the call was made in\\r\\nperson is now entirely obsolete.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst Calls.--It is desirable, when making a first call, to meet the lady\\r\\ncalled upon, and it is best to have been properly introduced. In the case\\r\\nof a stranger, the oldest or most prominent member of the social circle of\\r\\nthe town should call first. A polite expedient by which a newcomer makes\\r\\nentree into the society of a new place of residence is by sending her\\r\\ncards to those whom she wishes to know. These are, if possible, to be\\r\\naccompanied by the card of some well-known friend, who thus becomes her\\r\\nsocial sponsor.\\r\\n\\r\\n[692 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nA first call must be returned, and within two weeks at the outside. Not to\\r\\nreturn such a call is a gross breach of etiquette. Even if one does not\\r\\nwish or intend to keep up the acquaintance the return call must be made.\\r\\nAfter this call she may act her pleasure. If a newcomer extends an\\r\\ninvitation to an older resident, she should at once leave cards and send a\\r\\nregret or an acceptance. If the invitation comes through a friend, and she\\r\\nis unacquainted with the hostess, she must call soon; but if the call is\\r\\nnot returned, or another invitation extended, she must understand the\\r\\nacquaintance is ended. The newcomer may invite her late hostess to some\\r\\naffair at her own house, and if the invitation is accepted, may understand\\r\\nthe acquaintance is established.\\r\\n\\r\\nA stranger often finds her social progress slow unless she has\\r\\nacquaintances in her new location who can help place her where she wishes\\r\\nto be. The easiest way is to identify herself with some church, attend\\r\\nregularly, and the pastor calling on the new member of his congregation\\r\\nand finding her acceptable, will ask some of the ladies of the church to\\r\\ncall. These calls should be returned within two weeks; it would be a\\r\\ndiscourtesy to the pastor not to acknowledge them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nINVITATIONS.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Formal Invitation.--A dinner-party is the most formal and most\\r\\nimportant of all social functions. We may invite all our acquaintances to\\r\\na ball or a reception. We may select more carefully for our teas and\\r\\nluncheons, but the dinner is reserved as the greatest compliment to be\\r\\npaid those we wish to honor. Therefore an immediate acceptance or regret\\r\\nmust be sent, and nothing but illness, accident or death should prevent us\\r\\nfrom presenting ourselves. If such obstacles intervene, immediate notice\\r\\nshould be given the hostess, that she may supply the place at her table\\r\\nthus made vacant.\\r\\n\\r\\nDo not write you will \"try to come;\" that you will come but your husband\\r\\nwill not be able to do so, or in any way make your acceptance conditional.\\r\\nYour hostess may wish to invite another couple; she must know who will be\\r\\npresent that she may arrange her table accordingly. Nothing is so annoying\\r\\nto a hostess as to be obliged to rearrange her table because of some\\r\\nslight excuse on the part of a guest who has once accepted,\\r\\n\\r\\nDo not forget that an invitation to dinner is the highest social\\r\\ncompliment, and value it accordingly; also answer at once.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFormulas for Invitations.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe formula for a dinner invitation is this:\\r\\n\\r\\n               Mr. and Mrs. John Henry Smith\\r\\n                  request the pleasure of\\r\\n          Mr. and Mrs. George Brown\\'s company at dinner,\\r\\n                     127 Blank Avenue.\\r\\n              on March fifteenth at seven o\\'clock.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis invitation may be written on note paper or engraved on a card.\\r\\n\\r\\n[MANNERS AND SOCIAL CUSTOMS 693]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe correct form of reply is this:\\r\\n\\r\\n                Mr. and Mrs. George Brown\\r\\n        accept with pleasure the polite invitation of\\r\\n           Mr. and Mrs. John Henry Smith for dinner\\r\\n             on March fifteenth, at seven o\\'clock.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the dinner is in honor of guests, the formula may be:\\r\\n\\r\\n                       To meet\\r\\n            Mr. and Mrs. William Dash,\\r\\n    Mr. and Mrs. John Henry Smith request the pleasure of\\r\\n                   Miss Anderson\\'s\\r\\n                  company at dinner,\\r\\n            on Wednesday, January twenty-sixth,\\r\\n                  at seven o\\'clock.\\r\\n   R. S. V. P.                   91 East Ninety-fourth street.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the invitation must be declined, this form may be observed:\\r\\n\\r\\n                        Mr. and Mrs. Brown\\r\\n           regret that owing to a previous engagement\\r\\n                      they are unable to accept\\r\\n                 Mr. and Mrs. John Henry Smith\\'s\\r\\n                     very kind invitation\\r\\n               for Tuesday evening, March fifteenth.\\r\\n\\r\\nAny other reason, as illness, proposed absence, or the like, may be\\r\\nsubstituted for a \"previous engagement.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn acknowledging invitations it is better to err on the side of\\r\\nover-politeness than the reverse.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf a dance or theatre party is to follow the dinner, words indicating the\\r\\nfact are written across the lower part of the card or in the lower\\r\\nleft-hand corner.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"R. s v. p.\" stands for the French phrase, \"Respondez, sit vous\\r\\nplait,\"--meaning that a reply is desired.\\r\\n\\r\\n[694 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nReplies.--The reply to an invitation should be in the same form as the\\r\\ninvitation; thus if in the third person the reply should also be made in\\r\\nthe third person. Such invitations are the most formal. The reply is to be\\r\\naddressed according to the wording of the invitation: thus if Mr. and Mrs.\\r\\nJohn Henry Smith issue it, address the reply to them; if Mrs. John Henry\\r\\nSmith\\'s name alone appears, address it to her. The same rule applies to a\\r\\nwedding invitation. The acknowledgement is sent to the parties issuing the\\r\\ninvitation, not to those to be married.\\r\\n\\r\\nMust Not Ask Invitations.--It is not allowable to ask for an invitation to\\r\\na dinner, a luncheon or a card party for a guest or friend. These are\\r\\nfunctions arranged for a definite number of guests; to include another\\r\\nperson is not possible. If your hostess knows you have a guest, she will,\\r\\nif her arrangements make it practicable, include her; if not, there is no\\r\\nslight to you or your guest. The presence of a guest does not excuse one\\r\\nfrom a dinner, luncheon or card party, the invitation having been already\\r\\naccepted. Provide some pleasure for your friend, or leave her to a quiet\\r\\nevening at home.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn case a guest drops out at the last moment, as sometimes happens, one\\r\\nmay ask a very intimate friend, a relative, or some member of the family\\r\\nto fill the vacant seat. Such a \"last minute\" invitation is no compliment:\\r\\none knows she is simply a substitute, but good sense and kindliness should\\r\\nprompt the recipient to help out in the dilemma, which may happen to her\\r\\nnext time.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther Particulars.--Dinner invitations are issued in the name of the host\\r\\nand hostess, so also those for luncheons to which both men and women are\\r\\ninvited. Invitations to teas, card and garden parties, \"at homes,\" balls,\\r\\nand women\\'s luncheons are in the name of the hostess alone.\\r\\n\\r\\nGuests should present themselves punctually at the hour named in a dinner\\r\\nor luncheon invitation, allowing themselves just time to remove wraps,\\r\\netc., before the meal is announced. It is almost unpardonable to be late.\\r\\n\\r\\nInvitations are sent to people in mourning after the month following\\r\\nbereavement, not because acceptance is expected, but as a compliment,\\r\\nexcept that cards for dinners, luncheons and balls are not sent. Wedding\\r\\ncards and announcements, and cards for large general receptions are sent.\\r\\nDuring the year of mourning people thus remembered send cards with a\\r\\nnarrow black border in acknowledgment.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnless an entertainment is exclusively for women, an invitation to a\\r\\nmarried woman should include her husband. That he is personally unknown to\\r\\nthe hostess does not matter.\\r\\n\\r\\n[MANNERS AND SOCIAL CUSTOMS 695]\\r\\n\\r\\nINFORMAL INVITATIONS.\\r\\n\\r\\nInvitations by telephone are permissible for informal affairs, but why a\\r\\nwoman should spend hours at the telephone, calling up various parties and\\r\\nlosing her temper over \"Central\\'s\" dilatoriness when she could sit\\r\\ncomfortably at her desk and write notes, is difficult to understand.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhereas the formal luncheon invitation simply substitutes the word\\r\\n\"luncheon\" for \"dinner,\" the informal invitation is written in the first\\r\\nperson and requires a reply in the same form. It may be said again that\\r\\nthe response should follow the form of the invitation; this is an\\r\\ninvariable rule. This model is usually employed:\\r\\n\\r\\n    My dear Mrs. Henderson:\\r\\n       Will you and Mr. Henderson dine with us informally on Tuesday\\r\\n    evening, January twenty-seventh, at half-past six o\\'clock?\\r\\n    Trusting we may have the pleasure of seeing you, I am,\\r\\n                                        Yours sincerely,\\r\\n                                                     Mary Bronson.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn reply the recipient will write:\\r\\n\\r\\n    My dear Mrs. Bronson:\\r\\n       Mr. Henderson and I accept, with much pleasure your very kind\\r\\n    invitation to dine with you on Tuesday evening, January\\r\\n    twenty-seventh, at half past six o\\'clock.\\r\\n                                        Yours sincerely,\\r\\n                                                      Helen Henderson.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the invitation is for luncheon, that word is substituted; afternoon\\r\\nwritten in the place of evening, and Mr. Henderson is left out. In an\\r\\nacceptance, one should repeat the date and hour, that no mistake may\\r\\noccur. If the invitation must be declined, it is not correct to explain\\r\\nthe nature of the engagement or whatever reason occurs for refusal. We say\\r\\nwe \"are unable to accept,\" not that we \"will not be able;\" the refusal\\r\\nrests in the present.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn invitation sent by mail is enclosed in an envelope addressed to Mr. and\\r\\nMrs. A., and then in an outer envelope bearing full name and address.\\r\\nInformal notes of invitation are written on one\\'s best note-paper and no\\r\\nouter envelope used.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfternoon Tea.--The afternoon tea is a favorite method of paying off\\r\\nsocial debts. Elaborate refreshments are not served. Tea is poured at the\\r\\ndining table, by some friends asked to do so--it is thought quite a\\r\\ncompliment to be asked \"to pour\" For a very informal \"at home\" the hostess\\r\\nmay have a small table at hand and herself offer a cup of tea to her\\r\\nvisitors. For such a small affair she sends her visiting card with the\\r\\ndate written in the lower left hand corner. If many guests are expected\\r\\nservants must be at hand to remove soiled dishes and replenish the tea and\\r\\ncakes.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn acknowledgment of invitations, it is highly improper to send your card\\r\\nwith \"regrets\" written on it. An invitation is a courtesy offered; it must\\r\\nbe received courteously. You regret you \"must decline the pleasure\" of\\r\\naccepting somebody\\'s \"kind--or polite--invitation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n[696 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Verbal Invitation.--Verbal invitations do not count for much. \"Come\\r\\nand dine with us some day\" has no standing among invitations. The day and\\r\\nhour must be named if it is to be reckoned with. And then--suppose the\\r\\nhostess forgets she has given the invitation, or she prepares for a guest\\r\\nwho does not come! Except among very intimate friends the verbal\\r\\ninvitation should be looked upon with great caution. A verbal invitation\\r\\nshould be followed by a note repeating it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWEDDING INVITATIONS AND ANNOUNCEMENTS.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe number of wedding invitations often must conform to the size of the\\r\\nchurch or the house, and to the character of the wedding. If it is to be a\\r\\nlarge one, cards are usually sent as liberally as possible. An invitation\\r\\nto the church may not invite to the reception at the house afterwards,\\r\\nwhich may necessarily be limited because of the size of the house or the\\r\\nmeans of the family. No guest receiving cards for the church should let\\r\\nherself feel aggrieved because of failure to receive the other. Answers to\\r\\ninvitations should invariably be sent; many omit this, not thinking it\\r\\nnecessary, but why not?\\r\\n\\r\\nAnnouncement cards are sent to everyone you know, or, more properly, to\\r\\nall those whom you wish to recognize socially. It is quite correct to send\\r\\nthem to people you know but slightly. They are mailed immediately after\\r\\nthe wedding. They imply no obligation in the way of gift or reply. If an\\r\\n\"at home\" card is enclosed, calls are expected.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCorrect Form.\\r\\n\\r\\nWedding invitations of course must be engraved. The following form is\\r\\nemployed:\\r\\n\\r\\n    Mr. and Mrs. Lawrence Harmon\\r\\n    request the honor of your presence\\r\\n    at the marriage of their daughter\\r\\n              Harriet\\r\\n                to\\r\\n        Mr. Harrison Richard Ames\\r\\n    on Thursday, the sixth of January,\\r\\n         at twelve o\\'clock.\\r\\n       Church of the Messiah.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the wedding is at home, the street and number are given in place of the\\r\\nchurch.\\r\\n\\r\\n[MANNERS AND SOCIAL CUSTOMS 697]\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the bride has no mother, the invitations are issued in the name of the\\r\\nfather; if no father, the mother\\'s name is used. If an orphan, invitations\\r\\nare issued in the name of the nearest of kin in the town where the wedding\\r\\noccurs. If a married sister and her husband issue, the words \"their\\r\\nsister\" are used. If a girl has a stepfather her own name is engraved in\\r\\nfull. Announcement cards follow the same rules as to who issues them, and\\r\\nare couched in these words:\\r\\n\\r\\n        Mr. and Mrs. Hughson Smith\\r\\n     announce the marriage of their sister\\r\\n                Bettina\\r\\n                  to\\r\\n         Mr. James Rhodes Grayson,\\r\\n      on Monday, the tenth of January,\\r\\n         Nineteen hundred and ten,\\r\\n       at the Church of the Messiah,\\r\\n         in the City of Cleveland.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a home wedding, this formula is correct:\\r\\n\\r\\n    My dear Mrs. Jennings:\\r\\n    My daughter Julia is to be married to Mr. George Bronson Holmes on\\r\\n    Monday, the tenth of January, at twelve o\\'clock, and it will give Mr.\\r\\n    Brush and myself much pleasure if you and Mr. Jennings will come.\\r\\n                                Yours sincerely,\\r\\n                                                 Eleanor Graves Brush.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFor informal church weddings, with small reception to follow, or for a\\r\\nsimple home wedding, most people prefer to use the engraved cards, but\\r\\npersonal notes may with perfect propriety take their place. For a home\\r\\nwedding, the above formula is correct.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bridegroom\\'s Family.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn inviting the bridegroom\\'s parents by note, the mother may write: \"Will\\r\\nyou and Mr. Holmes come to the quiet informal wedding of my daughter Julia\\r\\nand your son on Monday,\" etc. Such invitations are written by the mother.\\r\\nOther members of the family are included by adding \"you and Mr. Jennings\\r\\nand your daughter will come.\" Written invitations may follow the form of\\r\\nthe engraved, but for a small wedding at home, which will be of course\\r\\nmore or less informal, the personal form seems more in keeping.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther Items.\\r\\n\\r\\nFormal wedding invitations and announcements are addressed, one to the\\r\\nhead of the family, Mr. and Mrs. Jones; one to Miss Jones, or to The\\r\\nMisses Jones, if there are several daughters, and one to each young man of\\r\\nthe family.\\r\\n\\r\\nNote that the year is given in an announcement, but not in an invitation.\\r\\nAnnouncements are engraved on note-paper, as in the case of invitations.\\r\\n\\r\\n[698 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nA double wedding, which requires two ceremonies, also requires two sets of\\r\\ninvitations and announcements.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is quite correct for a girl who has been employed in an office to send\\r\\nan announcement of her marriage to her former employer, but if he is\\r\\nmarried, it must be addressed to \"Mr. and Mrs.\" So-and-So.\\r\\n\\r\\nDo not abbreviate in writing notes of invitation, nor permit it on\\r\\nengraved invitations.

The dinner we provide is by no means of\\r\\nthe comfortable \"pot-Iuck\" kind. It is, in society, an elaborate and\\r\\nexpensive form of entertainment. A dinner to eight people, not specially\\r\\nelaborate and without wines, rarely costs the giver less than $25 or $30,\\r\\nand may easily run much higher. It requires delicacies for the palate,\\r\\nflowers and bonbons and other decorations for the table, and ceremonious\\r\\nserving. The finest of linen, cut glass and silver adorn it, and the\\r\\nrepast may easily be prolonged through two or more hours. Such a dinner is\\r\\nserved in courses; begins with an appetizer, extends through soup, fish,\\r\\njoint, salad and dessert courses at the very least, and ends with coffee,\\r\\nserved at the table or in some other apartment--the library or drawing\\r\\nroom--where the guests converse over their cups.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch a meal cannot be prepared or served without competent service in the\\r\\nkitchen and dining-room. The cook must know how to prepare every dish in\\r\\nthe best manner, and have it ready at the right moment; the waiter must be\\r\\nexperienced and noiseless. The hostess must have such perfect confidence\\r\\nthat everything will progress in perfect and proper order that she can\\r\\ngive her full attention to the guests,\\r\\n\\r\\nServing the Dinner.--Let us suppose a dinner for eight people is to be\\r\\nserved. The ceremonious dinner, the world over, is served a la Russe, that\\r\\nis, according to the Russian fashion. By this fashion nothing but the\\r\\ncovers--a term which includes the china, silver and glass at each\\r\\nplate--flowers, dishes of bonbons, salted nuts and olives, occasionally\\r\\nsmall cakes, are on the table when the guests are seated,\\r\\n\\r\\n[MANNERS AND SOCIAL CUSTOMS 699]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hostess has inspected the table, after it is laid, seeing that\\r\\neverything is correct, Silver must have had a fresh polish, the cut glass\\r\\nmust shine and sparkle, There must be plenty of light, yet no glare; to\\r\\nprevent this, ground glass globes on the electric lights are preferred.\\r\\nThe hostess herself will arrange the place cards, separating married\\r\\npeople, and in so far as possible so seating her guests that each may be\\r\\npleased with his or her neighbor. The centerpiece is of flowers; for this\\r\\nnever choose a strongly scented flower like hyacinths or narcissi. The\\r\\nheat, the odor of the food, combined with the scent of the flowers, may\\r\\ninduce lethargy, so that the dinner may be \"garnished with stupidity.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThere must be a service plate at each place. These are to be as handsome\\r\\nas you can afford. At the side of this is laid the dinner napkin, within\\r\\nwhich a roll is folded. The guest removes the napkin, unfolding it for\\r\\nuse. The waitress removes the service plate and puts down another on which\\r\\nis a grapefruit, vermouth, or other kind of cocktail. This plate and glass\\r\\nremoved, there comes another plate, and little dishes of caviarre are\\r\\npassed. These plates also disappear, others are substituted, and soup is\\r\\nserved. After the soup is eaten the soup plates are removed, leaving the\\r\\nother plates, and celery and radishes and salted nuts and olives are\\r\\npassed, not necessarily all, but at least two, say celery and olives; nuts\\r\\nand radishes. If the little individual almond dishes are used, of course\\r\\nthe salted nuts will not be passed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese plates are again changed when the fish is served, the rule being\\r\\nthat at no time during the dinner must a guest be without a plate before\\r\\nhim until the table is cleared for dessert. Moreover, the waitress, in\\r\\nplacing plates that have a monogram or heraldic device for decoration,\\r\\nmust so place the plate before each guest that the design faces him. In\\r\\ntaking up the plates, one is taken up with the right hand while with the\\r\\nleft the waitress replaces it with another; one plate is never placed upon\\r\\nanother.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fish, meat, and other courses are served from the pantry, the portions\\r\\nbeing arranged for convenience in helping, and garnished with parsley or\\r\\nlemon. The dish is passed first to the guest seated at the host\\'s right\\r\\nhand, next to the one on the left, and afterwards in regular rotation,\\r\\nirrespective of sex. All service is at the left; this leaves the guest\\'s\\r\\nright hand in position to help himself. The waitress holds the dish upon a\\r\\nfolded napkin on the flat of her hand, and low down. Vegetables are passed\\r\\nin the same fashion.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou will see how much depends upon having well trained servants at such a\\r\\ndinner. The service must be without haste, yet without delay; there must\\r\\nbe no clatter of china and silver, no awkwardness in removing plates, etc.\\r\\nThe waitress must be quick to refill glasses or supply whatever is needed.\\r\\n\\r\\n[700 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Help Required.--A dinner to twelve or fourteen guests cannot be served\\r\\nproperly without two or three waiters--usually men at such large\\r\\ndinners--and additional help in the kitchen. So much thought and anxiety\\r\\nare required for the success of a home dinner party that it is small\\r\\nwonder many prefer to add a little to the expense, in cities at least, and\\r\\norder a dinner for the requisite number at hotel or club, where the\\r\\nresponsibility rests with the management after the details of the menu are\\r\\nsettled. Such a dinner is less of a compliment to one\\'s guests than the\\r\\nentertainment at one\\'s own home, however; and why should one possess\\r\\nstores of beautiful and expensive furnishings without their use?\\r\\n\\r\\nOne dinner generally means another a short time afterwards, since in\\r\\nselecting the small number who can be entertained one must necessarily\\r\\nleave out others who have equal claims to hospitality and whose sense of\\r\\nbeing slighted must be appeased. And if the hostess is socially prominent\\r\\nshe may find herself embarked on a course of entertainments that will tax\\r\\nher time and her funds to a considerable degree.\\r\\n\\r\\nInvitations to a dinner must be sent at least two weeks in advance. As has\\r\\nalready been stated, an immediate and unconditional acceptance or regret\\r\\nis demanded.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrecedence.--At these formal dinners, the question of precedence engages\\r\\nthe hostess\\'s attention, If all the guests are about on equal terms, the\\r\\nhost takes out the oldest or most prominent lady, seating her at his\\r\\nright. The other, guests are paired off according to the hostess\\'s ideas\\r\\nof social propriety or congeniality. No man ever takes his wife in to\\r\\ndinner. The place of honor for men is at the hostess\\'s right hand. Dinner\\r\\ncards, legibly written, are placed on the napkins. The men draw out the\\r\\nchairs and seat the ladies, then seat themselves. Generally, at a small\\r\\ndinner, the hostess tells each man before leaving the drawing room, whom\\r\\nhe is to take out: at large functions, he finds in the men\\'s cloak room an\\r\\nenvelope addressed to him containing the lady\\'s name. He seeks out his\\r\\npartner and gives her his arm when dinner is announced.\\r\\n\\r\\nBe Prompt.--It is almost unpardonable for a guest to be late at a dinner.\\r\\nThe arrival should be within fifteen minutes of the time named on the\\r\\ninvitation, never earlier. The hostess must be ready in ample time, and\\r\\nmust appear calm and untroubled. Nervousness bespeaks the novice in\\r\\nentertaining. Generally, however, even if the affair passes off without\\r\\nany contretemps she is ready to say \"Thank heaven it\\'s over!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNow this is not to say that one may not serve a good and very enjoyable\\r\\ndinner or luncheon to a few friends, without as much trouble and expense\\r\\nas are here indicated. This is simply to state how such meals are served,\\r\\nformally and informally. Knowing the proper procedure one may adopt as\\r\\nmuch or as little as her circumstances and style of living warrant.\\r\\n\\r\\n[MANNERS AND SOCIAL CUSTOMS 701]\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE INFORMAL DINNER\\r\\n\\r\\nThe informal dinner resembles the formal, save that fewer courses are\\r\\nserved, the menu is simpler, and the decorations less elaborate. The\\r\\nserving is on the same order--a la Russe. If one is fortunate enough to\\r\\nhave a maid who combines the experience of a waitress with the qualities\\r\\nof a good cook, by ingenious planning it is possible to serve six persons\\r\\nacceptably in the approved fashion.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut there are thousands of households in which but one maid is kept, and\\r\\nin this case what may be termed \"the family dinner\" will be found better,\\r\\nbecause there will be no endeavor to do more than one can accomplish with\\r\\nthe means at her command. Better by far serve well and simply than attempt\\r\\nsomething more elaborate and fall short in it.\\r\\n\\r\\nFamily Dinners.--At the family dinner, the grape fruit or oyster cocktail,\\r\\nor the raw oysters which form the first course, is on the table when the\\r\\nguests are seated. The grape fruit may be served in glasses, like the\\r\\ncocktail. If oysters are served, the maid passes the condiments. She then\\r\\nremoves these plates, replacing them with service plates as she does so,\\r\\nand brings in the soup. This the hostess serves and the maid carries\\r\\nabout. While this is being eaten--celery or olives being passed after the\\r\\nguests are helped--the maid slips out in the kitchen to dish up the\\r\\nvegetables unless these are already in the warmer. Returning, she removes\\r\\nthe soup-plates, never taking more than two at a time. She then brings on\\r\\nthe joint or roast, placing it before the host, who proceeds to serve it.\\r\\n(If oysters are served first, a fish course is generally omitted; indeed,\\r\\nso many courses tax one\\'s resources too severely.) The maid carries about\\r\\nthe dinner plates, removing the service plate with the right hand and\\r\\nplacing the other with the left. She then passes the vegetables. The\\r\\nserving begins with the lady at the host\\'s right hand. If the piece de\\r\\nresistance is a turkey, white and dark meat and a portion of dressing are\\r\\nplaced on each plate; gravy and the vegetables, then cranberry or currant\\r\\njelly, are passed. Here the waitress should refill water glasses.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe plates are then removed for the salad course, and the table cleared.\\r\\nThis should be ready on the plates, and kept where it will be perfectly\\r\\ncold. While this is being brought on, the hostess will start dishes of\\r\\nsalted nuts and bonbons down the table, the guests passing them. After the\\r\\nsalad the plates are removed and the dessert brought in. This may be a\\r\\nmould of ice cream or a pudding; pie is seldom or never served. This the\\r\\nhost or hostess serves. The coffee service may be brought in, and the\\r\\nhostess pours it; little cakes or wafers, or mints, are usually passed\\r\\nwith it; then the maid is excused from further service. The hostess always\\r\\ngives the signal for leaving the table by a slight nod toward the lady on\\r\\nher husband\\'s right, and rising.\\r\\n\\r\\n[702 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nRequirements.--A dinner of this kind requires a serving-table or sideboard\\r\\nwhere china and silver may be in readiness. Such an aid is even more\\r\\nindispensable where the hostess serves the meal herself. Many very\\r\\nenjoyable \"company dinners\" are served where the hostess is also the cook,\\r\\nand she and her husband serve. If one has daughters they should be taught\\r\\nhow to serve, and may rise from the table to change plates and bring in\\r\\ncourses with perfect propriety. In such case, the soup is served at the\\r\\ntable and, as it is awkward to pass without spilling, some one should\\r\\ncarry it about if more than two or three guests are present. The roast or\\r\\nfowl is carved by the host; vegetables are on the table and are passed\\r\\nfrom hand to hand. After this course the hostess, or the daughter\\r\\ndelegated to do this, clears the table and brings in the salad. The\\r\\ndessert follows. Coffee is occasionally served with the meat course, but\\r\\nit is better to bring it on with the dessert. Cups, etc., should be in\\r\\nreadiness on the side table, to be transferred to the table. There should\\r\\nbe an apparent absence of formality at such a meal, though everything\\r\\nshould progress in regular order, systematically, quietly, without orders\\r\\nor clash. Above all things, see that everything likely to be wanted is at\\r\\nhand; nothing looks worse than someone jumping up to get some article that\\r\\nhas been forgotten. If dishes, spoons or forks must be washed during the\\r\\nprogress of the meal, have warm water ready in the kitchen, wash them\\r\\nquickly, and wipe them out of cold water; then their heat will not betray\\r\\nyour limited resources.\\r\\n\\r\\nSetting the Table.--The \"best cloth\" and napkins are brought out for the\\r\\ndinner party. The cloth must be laid with mathematical exactness, its\\r\\ncenter exactly on the center of the table. The centerpiece, almost\\r\\ninvariably of flowers, only occasionally of fruit, is also exactly placed.\\r\\nThis should be low; it is awkward not to be able to see one\\'s vis-a-vis,\\r\\nand the hostess should be able to command an uninterrupted view of her\\r\\ntable, so that if the waitress omits any service she may by a glance\\r\\ndirect her to supply it. The arrangement should be graceful and pretty,\\r\\nand, in summer, garden flowers may be used with propriety. The flowers\\r\\ngive the keynote of the color scheme; dinner cards, bonbons, ices and\\r\\ncreams and the decorations of the small cakes usually served with the\\r\\ndessert, conform to it. Candelabra are less used than at one time, but are\\r\\nby no means \"out.\" A handsome silver candelabra may be used as a\\r\\ncenterpiece, its base banked in flowers. On a square or oblong table,\\r\\ncandlesticks with shades give a touch of color that relieves the whiteness\\r\\nof napery and glass.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is a plate--your handsomest--at each place; a napkin squarely folded\\r\\nand lying flat; a row of forks at the left, oyster fork outside, then fish\\r\\nfork, dinner and salad fork, four in all, laid in the order in which they\\r\\nwill be used. Knives are at the right of the napkin, always two, a large\\r\\nand a small one. Fashion has re-introduced the steel-bladed knife for the\\r\\nmeat course; it is surprising to notice how much more tender meat is than\\r\\nit used to be when we tried to cut it with the silver knives. The\\r\\nsoup-spoon is laid at the top of the plate. The salad fork may be brought\\r\\nin with the salad if preferred, spoons with the dessert and coffee. Grape\\r\\nfruit is eaten with an orange spoon, laid at the right. No \"fancy folding\"\\r\\nof napkins is permissible. The glasses stand at the top of the plate, a\\r\\nlittle to the right. Small cut glass or fancy dishes containing the\\r\\nrelishes are placed near the corners of the table within the circle of\\r\\nplates if the table is square; if it is round they are so arranged so as\\r\\nto balance each other in the form of a square. There may be two of nuts\\r\\nand two of stuffed olives or of bonbons. Individual salt cellars are at\\r\\nthe top of the plate; a roll is folded in the napkin, sometimes laid on\\r\\nthe bread-and-butter plate, which is placed at the left. Such rolls should\\r\\nbe small and well-baked. At formal dinners no butter is served, and the\\r\\nplates are omitted. Finger bowls are brought in after the ices or the\\r\\npudding. They are on a small plate on which is a doily, and the fruit\\r\\nknife, if to be used, is on the plate. The guest lays bowl and doily at\\r\\nhis right, lifting the two together, the plate being for fruit, if any is\\r\\nserved. If no fruit, the bowl is left on the plate.\\r\\n\\r\\n[MANNERS AND SOCIAL CUSTOMS 703]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLUNCHEONS.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe luncheon is a less elaborate function than the dinner, but ranks next\\r\\nit in point of compliment and display. The \"stand-up\" or buffet luncheon\\r\\nis much less popular than formerly, in fact even at the so-called buffet\\r\\nluncheons the guests are now seated at small tables accommodating four.\\r\\nInvitations are sent out ten days or two weeks in advance, and require\\r\\nprompt replies.\\r\\n\\r\\nFormal Luncheons.--Save in a less elaborate menu, the formal luncheon\\r\\ndiffers very little from the dinner, except that the latter is at seven\\r\\no\\'clock, and the luncheon almost invariably at one. The menu generally\\r\\nbegins with grape fruit, served in glasses on small plates and doilies,\\r\\nand on the table when the guests are seated. An orange spoon is used. The\\r\\ntable is set as for dinner, save that less silver is laid. Bouillon,\\r\\nserved in bouillon cups, with a spoon on the saucer may follow. Then may\\r\\ncome lobster a la Newburg; sweet-breads and peas; salad; ices and coffee.\\r\\nIn place of the sweet-breads one may serve squab on toast, fillet of beef,\\r\\nor broiled chicken; peas, beets, and potatoes cut in balls and cooked in\\r\\ndeep fat may accompany anyone of these. The meat, cut in portions, and\\r\\nsurrounded by mounds of the vegetables, is often served from a large\\r\\nplatter, from which the guests help themselves. The hostess is served\\r\\nfirst; this is, that, in case any unfamiliar dish is served, she may show\\r\\nhow it is to be handled. The lady on her right is next in order of\\r\\nserving. The same etiquette in regard to serving, changing plates, etc.,\\r\\nis observed as at the dinner, save that the rolls are on bread-and-butter\\r\\nplates instead of being folded in the napkin. The decorations, ornamental\\r\\ndishes, candies, and the like are used as at a dinner.\\r\\n\\r\\nMinor Particulars.--The roast never figures at a luncheon; the courses\\r\\nconsist largely of what are called entrees, the idea being that the repast\\r\\nis of a lighter character than a dinner. The salad is a special feature;\\r\\nit may be chicken, Waldorf, fruit, or any kind preferred, but must be\\r\\ncarefully studied in its relation to the other dishes.\\r\\n\\r\\n[704 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe guests keep on their hats during the luncheon, removing the gloves as\\r\\nthey are seated; at an informal luncheon the gloves are removed in the\\r\\ndressing room.\\r\\n\\r\\nVery often bridge or some other card game follows the luncheon. If not,\\r\\nguests are not expected to remain more than half an hour after leaving the\\r\\ntable.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe luncheon--never say lunch--is a favorite form of entertainment for\\r\\ngirls. In this case the dishes served are light and delicate. Mushrooms on\\r\\ntoast, oyster patties or croquettes, a salad, and ices; the menu prefaced\\r\\nby grape fruit and bouillon, are often thought sufficient for a girl\\'s\\r\\nluncheon. Sweets are served freely for them.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is no longer thought correct to go to extremes in carrying out a \"color\\r\\nscheme.\" Sandwiches are not tied up with ribbons, nor cakes colored to\\r\\ncorrespond with the preferred hue. Flowers, ices, and the decorations on\\r\\nthe small cakes passed with the dessert are quite sufficient. Candles, if\\r\\nused, should have shades to correspond.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLarge Luncheons.--The large luncheon has few friends these days; it is too\\r\\nheterogeneous an affair. Those invited feel it is an easy way of paying\\r\\noff social obligations; few find it entirely enjoyable. There is more or\\r\\nless of a crush; one experiences difficulty in finding a table and being\\r\\nserved; it is not appetizing to note evidences that others have eaten at\\r\\nthe same table and departed. And one is likely to be seated with the wrong\\r\\npeople and thus miss much that belongs with and makes pleasant the smaller\\r\\naffair.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo woman need hesitate at inviting a few friends to have luncheon with\\r\\nher. She may prepare a simple meal, and if it is nicely served and she\\r\\nherself gives the cordiality and the conversational impetus that \"keeps\\r\\nthings going,\" her guests will find it enjoyable. She may adopt as much of\\r\\nthe regular method of serving as befits her home and its resources, but\\r\\nshe must make her table as beautiful as possible, and she must not serve\\r\\n\"stewed hostess.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTABLE ETIQUETTE.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have seen how a table should be laid and a meal served; now let us see\\r\\nhow it should be eaten:\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no situation in which one\\'s good breeding is so much in evidence\\r\\nas at the table. For that reason, mothers should begin to train their\\r\\nchildren in infancy to correct usage. As soon as a child is able to hold a\\r\\nspoon and fork, he should be taught how to hold them properly, and the\\r\\ntraining should be continued until the right habit is established.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne should not be seated until the lady of the house is seated, unless\\r\\nespecially requested to do so. Children should observe this rule as\\r\\nrigidly as that which requires the removal of the hat on entering the\\r\\nhouse.\\r\\n\\r\\n[MANNERS AND SOCIAL CUSTOMS 705]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the Table.--On being seated, the napkin is unfolded and laid across the\\r\\nlap. It is more correct to only unfold one-half, that is, open it at the\\r\\ncenter fold. One is not supposed to require further protection than from\\r\\nthe accidental crumb. On no account should it be used as a bib, or be\\r\\ntucked in the dress or waistcoat.\\r\\n\\r\\nGrape fruit is eaten from an orange spoon. If oysters are served raw, they\\r\\nmust not be cut but eaten whole.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoup must be taken from the side of the spoon, quietly, with no hissing or\\r\\nother sound, nor should the spoon be so full that it drips over. The\\r\\nmotion of the spoon in filling it, is away from instead of towards the\\r\\nperson; and tilting the plate to secure the last spoonful is bad form.\\r\\nCrackers are never served with soup: croutons--small squares of bread\\r\\ntoasted very hard and brown, or small H. & P. biscuits are passed. These\\r\\nare never put into the soup, but are eaten from the hand. Neither soup nor\\r\\nfish should be offered the second time.\\r\\n\\r\\nFish is generally eaten with a fork and a bit of bread, though silver fish\\r\\nknives are in occasional use. The entree which follows the fish should be\\r\\neaten with the fork only. A mouthful of meat is cut as required; it is\\r\\nnever buried in potato or any vegetable and then conveyed to the mouth.\\r\\nVegetables are no longer served in \"birds\\' bath-tubs,\" as some wit once\\r\\ncalled the individual vegetable dishes, but are cooked sufficiently dry to\\r\\nbe served on the plate with the meat. All vegetables are eaten with the\\r\\nfork, so also jellies, chutney, etc., served with the meat course.\\r\\n\\r\\nUsing the Fork.--The fork laid farthest from the plate is to be used for\\r\\nthe first course requiring such a utensil; the others are used in their\\r\\norder. The knife is held in the right hand; by the handle, not the blade.\\r\\nThe fork should not be held like a spoon, or a shovel, but more as one\\r\\nwould hold a pencil or pen; it is raised laterally to the mouth. The elbow\\r\\nis not to be projected, or crooked outward, in using either knife or fork;\\r\\nthat is a very awkward performance. The fork should never be\\r\\nover-burdened. The knife is never lifted to the mouth; it is said that\\r\\n\"only members of the legislature eat pie with a knife nowadays.\" The\\r\\nhandle of neither knife or fork may rest on the table nor the former be\\r\\nlaid across the edge of the plate.\\r\\n\\r\\nTender meat, like the breast of chickens, may be cut with the fork. A bone\\r\\nis never taken in the fingers, the historic anecdote about Queen Victoria\\r\\nto the contrary notwithstanding. The table manners of the twentieth\\r\\ncentury are not Early Victorian. Olives and celery are correctly laid on\\r\\nthe bread-and-butter plate. The former is never dipped in one\\'s salt\\r\\ncellar; a small portion of salt is put on the edge of the plate; both are\\r\\neaten from the fingers.\\r\\n\\r\\n[706 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nVegetables, Fruits, etc.--Green corn is seldom served on the cob at\\r\\nceremonious dinners. If it is served, it is to be broken in medium-sized\\r\\npieces and eaten from the cob, a rather messy process, and one not pretty\\r\\nto observe. The fastidious avoid it. If eaten, the piece is held between\\r\\nthe fingers of one hand. To take an unbroken ear in both hands and gnaw\\r\\nthe length of it suggests the manners of an animal never named in polite\\r\\nsociety.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is correct to take up asparagus by the stalk, and eat it from the\\r\\nfingers, but the newer and more desirable custom is to cut off the edible\\r\\nportion with knife and fork. Lettuce is never cut with a knife; a fork is\\r\\nused, the piece rolled up and conveyed to the mouth.\\r\\n\\r\\nHard cheese may be eaten from the fingers; soft cheeses, like Neufchatel,\\r\\nBrie, and the like, are eaten with the fork, or a bit is spread on a\\r\\nmorsel of bread and conveyed to the mouth with the fingers.\\r\\n\\r\\nA soft cake is eaten with a fork. The rule is that whatever can be eaten\\r\\nwith a fork shall be so eaten.\\r\\n\\r\\nRoman punch and sherbets require a spoon. Berries, peaches and cream,\\r\\ncustards, preserves, jellies, call for the spoon. Strawberries are often\\r\\nserved as a first course in their season. They are then arranged with\\r\\ntheir hulls and a portion of stem left on, dipped in powdered sugar and\\r\\neaten from the fingers. A little mound of the sugar is pressed into shape\\r\\nin the center of the small plate and the berries laid around it.\\r\\n\\r\\nPeaches, pears, and apples are peeled with the fruit knife, cut in\\r\\nquarters or eighths, and eaten from the fingers. Bananas are stripped of\\r\\nthe skin, cut in pieces with a fork and eaten from it. Oranges are cut in\\r\\ntwo across the sections and eaten with an orange spoon. Plums, like\\r\\nolives, are eaten by biting off the pulp without taking the stone in the\\r\\nmouth. Pineapple, unless shredded or cut up, requires both knife and fork;\\r\\nit is usually prepared for more convenient eating. Grapes, which should be\\r\\nwashed by letting water from the faucet run over them and laid on a folded\\r\\ntowel until the moisture drips off, are eaten from behind the half-closed\\r\\nhand, which receives the skins and seeds, then to be deposited on the\\r\\nplate.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the small cup of coffee--the demi-tasse--is served, the small\\r\\nafter-dinner coffee spoon is necessary. Cream is seldom served with the\\r\\nblack coffee--cafe noir--with which a meal concludes, cut loaf sugar is\\r\\npassed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Spoon.--The spoon must never be left in the cup, no matter what\\r\\nbeverage is served. Most of us have seen some absent-minded individual (we\\r\\nwill charitably suppose him absent-minded instead of ignorant), stir his\\r\\ncoffee round and round and round, creating a miniature whirlpool and very\\r\\nlikely slopping it over into the saucer; then, prisoning the spoon with a\\r\\nfinger, drink half the cup\\'s contents at a gulp. To do this is positively\\r\\nvulgar. Stir the coffee or tea very slightly, just enough to stir the\\r\\ncream and sugar with it, then drink in sips. To take either from the\\r\\nteaspoon is bad form. Bread is broken, not cut, and only a small portion\\r\\nbuttered at a time. Do not play with bread crumbs or spoon, etc., during\\r\\nthe progress of a meal. Leave knife and fork on the plate, handles side by\\r\\nside, when it is passed for a second helping, and at a conclusion of a\\r\\ncourse, or the meal, lay them in the same position, points of the fork\\r\\nupward.\\r\\n\\r\\n[MANNERS AND SOCIAL CUSTOMS 707]\\r\\n\\r\\nFinger Bowls.--When finger bowls are brought, the tips of the fingers are\\r\\ndipped in the bowl and dried on the napkin. Men may lift the moistened\\r\\nfingers to the lips; women seldom do this, but wipe the lips with the\\r\\nnapkin. At any function the napkin is not folded, but laid at the side of\\r\\nthe plate at the conclusion of the repast. If a guest for a day or so, or\\r\\nfor more than one meal, note what your hostess does with her napkin and\\r\\nfollow her. If a guest at only one meal, never fold the napkin. Be careful\\r\\nnot to throw it down so carelessly that it is stained with coffee, fruit,\\r\\nor fruit juices; your hostess will thank you for your consideration.\\r\\n\\r\\nBe ready to rise when your hostess rises; you do not push your chair into\\r\\nplace; simply rise and leave it. Rise on the side of your chair so you\\r\\nwill not have to go around it in following your hostess to the drawing\\r\\nroom.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRECEPTIONS.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen invitations are sent out for a reception, the recipient dons her\\r\\nhandsomest afternoon gown for the occasion. This may be a dressy tailored\\r\\nsuit; by this is meant one not severely simple; or she may wear some\\r\\nhandsome trained gown under a long coat. Small cards for presentation at\\r\\nthe door are sometimes enclosed with invitations to a large reception or\\r\\nbuffet luncheon, since \"the pushers\" have been known to present themselves\\r\\nat such functions without having been invited. These cards are handed to\\r\\nthe man who opens the carriage door. An awning extends from the door to\\r\\nthe curb, and strips of carpet are laid under it, A maid opens the door\\r\\nand directs guests to the dressing room, where wraps are laid aside, hats\\r\\nand gloves being retained.\\r\\n\\r\\nReceiving.--The hostess stands near the door of the drawing room,\\r\\nwelcoming her guests with hand and smile. Next to her stand the ladies who\\r\\nreceive with her. During the hour of arrival there is seldom opportunity\\r\\nfor more than a word of greeting, and one should not linger but pass on\\r\\ndown the line. A reception is often given to some visiting stranger, who\\r\\nis introduced by the hostess.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe guests then circulate through the rooms, greeting acquaintances, and\\r\\ndrifting eventually to the dining room, where refreshments are served.\\r\\nThey may stay as long as they find it agreeable, within the hours named on\\r\\nthe card of invitation, but people seldom stay more than an hour.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hostess remains near the door after the rush is over to greet the\\r\\nbelated guest and bid adieu to those who are leaving.\\r\\n\\r\\n[708 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nDecorations.--It is usual to decorate the rooms with flowers, and the\\r\\nservices of the florist as well as the caterer are required if it is a\\r\\nlarge affair. Cards are usually left, as a token that one has been\\r\\npresent, but in this case a card is manifestly not a visit, since it would\\r\\nbe absurd for a woman to invite fifty, a hundred, or even five hundred\\r\\npeople, who would expect her to call on them afterwards. Cards are sent by\\r\\nthose who do not attend, on the day. A reception given for forty or fifty\\r\\npeople is less formal, perhaps, but requires flowers--in less\\r\\nprofusion--and refreshments. The awning may be dispensed with if the day\\r\\nis fine, but seldom is. The door must be promptly opened, and the maid\\r\\nremains at her post during the affair if there are many guests, to open it\\r\\nfor those who leave as well as those who arrive.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHOSPITALITY IN THE HOME.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There is an emanation from the heart in genuine hospitality which cannot\\r\\nbe described, but is immediately felt, and puts the stranger at once at\\r\\nhis ease.\"\\r\\n                                                   --Washington Irving.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWere we to look up the meaning of the word hospitality in the dictionary,\\r\\nwe would find it defined as the act of receiving and entertaining guests\\r\\nkindly, generously, and gratuitously, without expectation of reward.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to such a definition, much that passes for hospitality in the\\r\\nsocial realm does not deserve the name. Society is a give-and-take\\r\\narrangement, somewhat resembling the gift exchange we practise at\\r\\nChristmas. If you do not give you do not get; if you do not entertain you\\r\\nare not invited, unless it is understood that circumstances prevent your\\r\\ndoing so. Then one is asked for what one can contribute in the way of good\\r\\ncompany, promotion of gayety, and the like. One \"pays her way\" by being\\r\\nagreeable, well gowned, popular. Thus, in a way, much social hospitality\\r\\nis merely social bargaining. The woman who feels indebted to her\\r\\ncircle--or circles, for these impinge upon each other--gives a large\\r\\nreception or \"at home.\" She can seldom do more than welcome the coming and\\r\\nspeed the parting guest. Her greeting is \"So delighted to see you here;\"\\r\\nher farewell, \"Good-bye; so glad you were able to come.\" Her guests have\\r\\ngreeted each other in much the same casual fashion, have had some\\r\\nrefreshments warranted to destroy their appetite for dinner; have shown a\\r\\nhandsome gown and hat--and perhaps had the former injured in the crush.\\r\\nOne is reminded of Bunthorne\\'s \"Hollow! Hollow! Hollow!!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nReal Hospitality.--Quite different is this from what we offer when we\\r\\ninvite our friends to visit us. Here is genuine hospitality--the receiving\\r\\nand entertaining gratuitously those whose companionship we enjoy. One of\\r\\nthe chief joys of having one\\'s own home is the pleasure of being able to\\r\\nwelcome one\\'s friends and afford them the privilege of enjoying it also.\\r\\nAn invitation of this kind means we are willing to incommode ourselves,\\r\\nincur expense, and give a measure of our time to the entertainment of\\r\\nthose of our friends whose society we wish to enjoy familiarly. Thus it\\r\\nseems that an invitation to visit a friend in her home is a compliment of\\r\\nno mean order, although Nicole says: \"\\'Visits are for the most part\\r\\nneither more nor less than inventions for discharging upon our neighbors\\r\\nsomewhat of our own unendurable weight.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n[MANNERS AND SOCIAL CUSTOMS 709]\\r\\n\\r\\nShort Visits.--Visits are of much shorter duration than in those \"old\\r\\ntimes\" people talk about so enthusiastically--and would find so tiresome\\r\\nwere they to return again. Then visitors stayed week after week; were\\r\\nurged to remain longer when they proposed departure. The story goes of a\\r\\nVirginia planter who invited an old war-time friend to visit him. At the\\r\\nend of a month the major proposed departure. His host objected so\\r\\nstrenuously that he agreed to stay another month. And so it went on, the\\r\\nguest regularly proposing to leave, the host hospitably insisting on his\\r\\nremaining, until in the end the old veteran died in and was buried from\\r\\nhis friend\\'s house. This, however, is an example not to be emulated in\\r\\nthese less hospitable days.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is a saying, \"Short visits make long friends,\" that is worth\\r\\nconsideration by those who visit. Probably the truth of the saying has\\r\\nbeen so often attested that it has given rise to the custom of specifying\\r\\nthe date of arrival and departure of a guest when giving the invitation.\\r\\nIt has become to be understood that the vague, indefinite invitation \"Do\\r\\ncome and see us sometime,\" means nothing. No one would think for a moment\\r\\nof taking it in good faith. If the giver wishes to entertain her friend\\r\\nshe will ask if it will be convenient for her to visit her at a certain\\r\\nspecified date. Nothing less counts. An understanding of this might save\\r\\nthe unexperienced from the awkwardness of making an unwelcome visit.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Unexpected Visit.--Nothing is worse form than \"the surprise visit.\"\\r\\nGenerally you do surprise your hostess and very often most disagreeably. A\\r\\nhousekeeper does not enjoy an intrusion--for such it is--of that kind any\\r\\nmore than you would be pleased to have a chance caller rush unannounced\\r\\ninto your private rooms. Even among relatives and the most intimate\\r\\nfriends, there is nothing to justify the unexpected arrival. Nothing so\\r\\nstrikes terror to a woman\\'s soul as the thud of trunks on the piazza and\\r\\nthe crunch of wheels on the gravel, meaning someone has \"come to stay.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch an arrival is a piece of presumption on the part of the visitor. She\\r\\nassumes she will be welcome at any time she chooses to present herself.\\r\\nThis may be true; but at the same time there is an obligation of courtesy\\r\\nwhich requires her to consult her friend\\'s convenience. Instead, she\\r\\nconsults her own and utterly ignores that of her hostess, who is thus\\r\\nforced into entertaining her.\\r\\n\\r\\n[710 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Inopportune Arrival.--Many awkward and sometimes amusing anecdotes are\\r\\ntold in connection with the inopportune visit. Thus not long ago the\\r\\nnewspapers chronicled the plight of a woman who undertook to surprise an\\r\\nacquaintance from whom she had not heard for several years. She was driven\\r\\nto their house and dismissed the carriage. A strange face met her at the\\r\\ndoor, and she learned that her friend had removed to another city nearly a\\r\\ntwelvemonth before. \"Served her right\" will be everybody\\'s verdict.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuppose one arrives unexpectedly and finds the friend\\'s house full of\\r\\nother and invited company. Then, if ever, she ought to feel herself \"a\\r\\nrank outsider.\" If she is tactless enough not to give notice of her\\r\\nintended arrival, she probably has not the good sense to depart as quickly\\r\\nas possible. The man of the house may have to sleep on the parlor sofa, or\\r\\nthe children on the floor, and ninety-nine times out of a hundred the\\r\\nwhole family will wish her in Halifax.\\r\\n\\r\\nOr she may arrive to find some member of the family ill, or house-cleaning\\r\\nor repairing in progress, or the house in the hands of the decorators.\\r\\nIndeed, so many unforeseen accidents may occur to make her visit an\\r\\nunpleasant memory, both to herself and her hostess, that only the most\\r\\nselfish and inconsiderate of women will so violate the social conventions\\r\\nas to make \"surprise visits.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nVisits That Save Expense.--Something equally reprehensible is the visit we\\r\\npay to a friend in town where we have business or desire a pleasure trip,\\r\\nand do not propose to have it cost us much of anything. We force\\r\\nhospitality on our acquaintances in order to save hotel bills. They know\\r\\nit, and they feel about it just exactly as we would in their places--that\\r\\nis, that it is an imposition on good nature and a mean and selfish thing\\r\\nto do.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We gave up our house and went to boarding simply because my health and my\\r\\nhusband\\'s salary were inadequate to the demands made upon them by our\\r\\nout-of-town relatives and acquaintances, who used us as a restaurant and\\r\\nhotel. There was seldom a week when we did not give ten or twelve meals\\r\\nand two or three nights lodging to people better able to pay for them than\\r\\nwe were to furnish them. So we gave up housekeeping.\" This is an actual\\r\\nexperience.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWEEK-END VISITS.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe \"house-party,\" as the week-end visit is now often styled, is a\\r\\ncomparatively recent addition to social entertainments. It is a fashion\\r\\nimported from England, and a very good one. It is the \"from Saturday to\\r\\nMonday\" visit, and so universally recognized that during the summer extra\\r\\ntrolley cars and railroad trains are in use to convey resorters and their\\r\\nguests to summer homes in the country.\\r\\n\\r\\nInvitations to a house-party are given several weeks in advance, and great\\r\\ncare should be taken to invite those who are congenial and will \"mix\\r\\nwell,\" since where a few are thrown together congeniality is absolutely\\r\\nessential to success. The invitations are informal; the length of the\\r\\nvisit definitely fixed; even the train by which the visitor is expected to\\r\\narrive and leave is mentioned, that there may be no misunderstanding.\\r\\n\\r\\n[MANNERS AND SOCIAL CUSTOMS 711]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Invitation.--One may write to her friend: \"Won\\'t you give us the\\r\\npleasure of entertaining you from Friday afternoon to Monday? The 3:45\\r\\ntrain will bring you here in time for tea. There is to be a musical in the\\r\\nevening; an automobile ride is planned for Saturday afternoon, to show you\\r\\nthe beauties of our vicinity, and there is to be the usual Saturday\\r\\nevening dance at the hotel. A train leaves here at 10:30 Monday morning,\\r\\nwhich will take you back to the city in ample time for lunch. Hoping to\\r\\nhave the happiness of seeing you on Friday, I am,\" etc., etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis not only suggests to your friend at what time she is expected to\\r\\narrive and depart, but gives her an idea of what she should bring with her\\r\\nin the way of clothes. One should always take her prettiest gowns that\\r\\nwill be suitable to the entertainments proposed for her pleasure--for a\\r\\nhostess naturally wishes to have her guests make a good appearance. From\\r\\nfour to six is the number generally asked to a small house-party, since\\r\\nthe usual summer cottage has few guest rooms. The guests are, if possible,\\r\\nevenly divided as to sex, and a hostess may, with perfect propriety,\\r\\narrange that the men of the party shall be lodged at a hotel, coming over\\r\\nto breakfast with their entertainer.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmusements.--Some amusements are always provided for the visitors at a\\r\\nhouse-party. Often a dinner-party is planned for Sunday, in which several\\r\\nother guests are included. Men who cannot leave business for even a\\r\\nweek-end often come out Sunday for a dinner and a breath of country air.\\r\\nNow that automobiles are as plenty as black-berries the railroad train\\r\\ncan be ignored. Young people living in the country should take advantage\\r\\nof this method of entertaining their city friends, who will find the\\r\\nchange delightful in summer, and will gladly reciprocate by inviting them\\r\\nto the city during the social season. Remember that a hearty hospitality,\\r\\na sincere joy in seeing your friends, and the fresh milk, eggs and fruits\\r\\nyou can offer will do much toward counterbalancing your lack of \"city\\r\\nconveniences.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Hostess\\'s Arrangements.--The hostess should arrange to have the guests\\r\\nmet at the station. She will naturally try to have them arrive by the same\\r\\ntrain, is possible; but she must see that their baggage arrives at the\\r\\nhouse nearly as soon as they do, that they may at once remove the soil of\\r\\ntravel and dress for the evening meal. She may or she may not meet them at\\r\\nthe station, according to her own convenience, but she must be ready to\\r\\nreceive them when they arrive at the home. If the journey has been long, a\\r\\ncup of tea may be offered; otherwise they are at once shown to their\\r\\nrooms. The hostess does this for her women guests, the host or a servant\\r\\nfor the men.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf a visitor is so unfortunate as to miss her train she should immediately\\r\\ntelegraph or telephone her hostess, explaining the accident, and saying\\r\\nshe will arrange to have herself conveyed from the station to the house on\\r\\nher arrival by a later train. Of course, the hostess will not permit this,\\r\\nbut will send some vehicle to meet the next train.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe matter of guest rooms and their conveniences, proper furnishings,\\r\\netc., will be taken up in a later section.\\r\\n\\r\\n[712 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat Is Expected of Guests.--One does not invite guests to make them\\r\\nuncomfortable, therefore it is best not to expect them to rise for an\\r\\nearly breakfast. If they are expected to present themselves, as late an\\r\\nhour as possible should be named. But they may be served with coffee,\\r\\nrolls, fruit and any other easily prepared breakfast dish whenever they\\r\\nplease to arise, being given to understand that a substantial breakfast is\\r\\nthe price of the extra \"forty winks.\" Guests at a house-party are expected\\r\\nto entertain themselves, among themselves, to a considerable extent. They\\r\\nmay walk, or row, or play croquet or tennis, or read or gossip or play\\r\\ncards, while the hostess attends to her domestic duties. If the party is\\r\\nlarge, or if but one or no servants are kept, the women should quietly\\r\\nattend to their own rooms, making up the bed and picking up their own\\r\\nbelongings. Whether they may do this or not depends upon circumstances of\\r\\nwhich they must judge.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most enjoyable house-parties are given in these roomy old houses with\\r\\nbroad verandas, surrounded with lawn and garden. But this need not deter\\r\\nthose having less delightful surroundings from offering their best to\\r\\ntheir friends. It is not so much the elegance of what we offer as the\\r\\nmanner in which it is offered that makes our friends remember their visit\\r\\nwith pleasure.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDress at Week-End Visits.--Women wear a simple tailored suit while\\r\\ntraveling, with white waist or silk skirt to match. If the weather is\\r\\nwarm, white duck, pique or linen skirts with white shirts are worn\\r\\nmornings; afternoons, foulard, or some of the fine and dainty fabrics\\r\\nsuited to the season. For evening, nothing is prettier than white for the\\r\\nyoung--and, indeed, \"everybody wears white.\" By change of accessories, the\\r\\nsame white gown may be made to do for the two evenings. If an automobile\\r\\ntrip is part of the entertainment, one should take an ulster or long loose\\r\\ncoat and veil.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe woman\\'s greatest trouble is to carry a second hat--something she may\\r\\nneed under some circumstances, though the fashion of going bareheaded\\r\\nhelps considerably. But if the entertainment includes a garden party, a\\r\\ntea or reception, she must have a hat. The trunk is uncalled for, and the\\r\\nsuitcase is disobliging. What shall she do?\\r\\n\\r\\nHer best plan will be to have a becoming shape covered with black tulle or\\r\\nmalines, and a made bow attached to it to travel in. On arrival, she will\\r\\ndetach the bow and pin on a couple of plumes, an aigrette, or flowers,\\r\\nconverting it into a dress hat.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMen\\'s Wear.--The man wears the ordinary business suit for travelling, sack\\r\\nor cutaway. He wears in the country in the morning a suit of flannel,\\r\\ntweed or cheviot, a straw hat and tan shoes. His shirt may be of striped\\r\\nmadras or linen, with a white collar. The cutaway coat is correct for\\r\\nordinary afternoon wear, with a white waistcoat, white shirt and\\r\\nfour-in-hand tie. This takes the place in summer of the frock coat, which\\r\\nis the formal day wear. He will seldom, if ever, have occasion for a dress\\r\\nsuit at a week-end visit in summer. Of course, the size of the party and\\r\\nthe gayeties in which one will participate have a bearing on the dress\\r\\nquestion, but the tendency is for men\\'s dress to be more comfortable and\\r\\nless formal in summer, especially in the country.\\r\\n\\r\\n[MANNERS AND SOCIAL CUSTOMS 713]\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE DUTIES OF A HOSTESS.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe woman who is entertaining guests must remember two things: that she\\r\\nmust not neglect them, and that she must not tire them out with too much\\r\\nattention. There is a \"happy mean\" to be attained, which is the climax of\\r\\npleasure and comfort to both.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne woman makes her visitor feel that \"the domestic veal\" has been\\r\\nslaughtered in her behalf. The usual manner of living and habits of life\\r\\nhave been put aside that she may be \"entertained.\" Elaborate meals are\\r\\nplanned; there is a straining after hospitality which defeats its own\\r\\npurpose and makes the visitor uncomfortable, because the hostess has so\\r\\nmanifestly incommoded herself. The fussy hostess puts too much endeavor\\r\\ninto her entertainment.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the other hand, there is the hostess who announces her intention of\\r\\nregarding her visitor as \"one of the family,\" \"making no fuss\" on account\\r\\nof her being in the house. This sounds much better than it works out in\\r\\nactual practice. Unless we are prepared to modify our routine in\\r\\naccordance with our friend\\'s pleasure and convenience, at least to some\\r\\nextent, we should not invite her. We do not ask people to our houses to\\r\\nmake them more uncomfortable than they would be at home. A visit is in the\\r\\nnature of a holiday, or vacation, to the visitor; we are to see to it that\\r\\nshe is deferred to and efforts made to please her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Visitor\\'s Comfort.--It is hospitable to consult her tastes in the\\r\\nmatter of food. It is uncomfortable for both hostess and guest if the\\r\\nprincipal dish at dinner is something the latter dislikes. Nor should we\\r\\nask her to conform to the family breakfast hour if we know she is\\r\\nunaccustomed to early hours, or is very much fatigued. In that case it is\\r\\nbest to say that the early breakfast is a family necessity and that she\\r\\nwill not be expected to appear at it, but may have her coffee and toast in\\r\\nher own room or down stairs at the hour at which she wishes to rise. This,\\r\\nthough it may necessitate the preparation of a tray to be sent up, is\\r\\nreally a convenience to the hostess, who is then left free to attend to\\r\\nher domestic duties. As some one has said, \"It is not hospitality to ask a\\r\\nguest to your rooftree and expect her to find sufficient delight in being\\r\\nthere and doing as you do.\" Very often she would be far more comfortable\\r\\nat home, physically at least. Remember your object in inviting people is\\r\\nto make them happy. Unless you are willing to make some sacrifices to do\\r\\nthis, do not invite them.\\r\\n\\r\\n[714 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nPreparing for Company.--An expected guest should always be met at the\\r\\nstation by some member of the family. The guest room should be in\\r\\nreadiness, closet and bureau drawers vacated for her use. The bed should\\r\\nbe freshly made up, the bedding having been properly aired. It would seem\\r\\nthat no one would offer a visitor a bed that has not been changed and\\r\\naired after having been slept in, yet guests, exchanging experiences,\\r\\nacknowledge it has been done--let us hope through inadvertence, though it\\r\\nis really inexcusable.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere should be plenty of fresh towels and water; a fresh cake of soap, a\\r\\ncandlestick and matches, and a waste paper basket. On the dressing-bureau\\r\\nthere should be a spotless spread, a pincushion well stocked with pins,\\r\\nhand mirror, comb and brush. The guest will bring her own, but may need to\\r\\nuse these before her luggage arrives. The brush and comb should have been\\r\\nwashed after a previous using.\\r\\n\\r\\nA lounge, preferably placed at the foot of the bed if there is room; a\\r\\nlight quilt or blanket for use upon it; an easy chair, and a clock in good\\r\\nworking order are desirable furnishings. Writing materials should be\\r\\nprovided. Some careful and painstaking hostesses include a small writing\\r\\ndesk, well stocked with paper, pens and ink, postage stamps, even picture\\r\\npostal cards already stamped and ready to be addressed. A new magazine and\\r\\na few books, and a little basket containing thimble, needles, scissors and\\r\\nseveral spools of cotton complete the conveniences arranged for the guest.\\r\\nA potted plant, or a few flowers in a vase, give a personal touch that\\r\\nbespeaks the hostess\\'s solicitude for the pleasure of her friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no more delicious flattery than that of having one\\'s personal\\r\\ntastes remembered and recognized.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Visitor\\'s Entertainment.--The entertainment of a guest is, of course,\\r\\ndependent on the hostess\\'s means, mode of life, social standing, the\\r\\nseason of the year, and whether one lives in town or in the country.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe will ask some of her friends to call on her guest; she will give a\\r\\nlittle entertainment for her, at cards, or a tea, or a reception,\\r\\naccording to circumstances. No doubt her friends will include her visitor\\r\\nin their invitations during her stay. She will take her friend to see the\\r\\nsights of her home city if she is a stranger; she may give a theatre\\r\\nparty, or at least take her friend several times. She will pay her guest\\'s\\r\\ncarfare, unless the other anticipates her, and pay for the theatre\\r\\ntickets. It will be perfectly correct for the guest to \"stand treat\" by\\r\\ninviting her host and hostess to accompany her to concert or play, paying\\r\\nfor the seats herself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Hostess\\'s Invitations.--It often happens that a hostess has\\r\\ninvitations not extended to her visitor. She may have accepted; before her\\r\\nguest\\'s arrival, an invitation to dinner, card party or luncheon. In\\r\\nneither of these may she ask to have her guests included. They are formal\\r\\nfunctions for which arrangements are made long in advance. She may say to\\r\\nan intimate friend who is giving a musical or an \"At home\" or any informal\\r\\naffair, that she has a visitor staying with her, and the friend will no\\r\\ndoubt extend an invitation to the latter. It is proper for host and\\r\\nhostess to accept invitations in which a guest is not included if they\\r\\nmake some provision for her pleasure during their absence.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe may be asked to invite some friend to dine with her, or someone\\r\\nprovided to take her to the theatre. Nor has she a right to feel affronted\\r\\nat being left at home.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne thing must be carefully avoided, the hostess must not let her guest\\r\\nfeel, for one moment, that she is the cause of inconvenience or trouble.\\r\\nEven if she is, the fact must be sedulously concealed. Bear with the\\r\\nannoyance until the visit ceases; then do not invite her again. It is the\\r\\nhostess\\'s privilege to invite; having invited she must not allow her\\r\\nequanimity to be disturbed.\\r\\n\\r\\n[MANNERS AND SOCIAL CUSTOMS 715]\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE OBLIGATIONS OF A GUEST.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf it is the duty of the hostess to be attentive to the comfort of her\\r\\nguest, there is quite as much obligation resting on the guest to show a\\r\\ndisposition to be pleased and to make herself agreeable. Some women--young\\r\\ngirls more particularly--seem to think too much cannot be done for their\\r\\nentertainment. They make themselves burdensome by their wish to have\\r\\n\"something doing\" all the time. The visitor who conveys the impression\\r\\nthat she is neglected unless some festivity is in the immediate future\\r\\neasily becomes tiresome.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe guest should accommodate herself to the ways of the family. Especially\\r\\nshould she be punctual at meals and ready on time when going out with her\\r\\nfriends. Her host may acquire a dislike to her if she keeps him waiting.\\r\\nShe should always be neatly dressed, never appearing at the breakfast\\r\\ntable in kimona or dressing-jacket if men will be present. She should\\r\\nrespect the privileges of the host, not occupying his easy chair,\\r\\nappropriating the newspaper or the best position round the lamp. She\\r\\nshould give as little trouble as possible and be especially careful about\\r\\nscattering her belongings about the house. This particularly applies to\\r\\nyoung girls, who are apt to be careless in this respect. It annoys a\\r\\nhostess to find Missy\\'s rubbers kicked off in the hall, her hat on the\\r\\npiano, and a half eaten box of candy on the parlor sofa.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout Being Thoughtful.--She should be careful to avoid injury to any of\\r\\nher hostess\\' pretty things or her furnishings. The story is told of a girl\\r\\nwho, conducted to her hostess\\'s beautiful guest room, furnished with the\\r\\nutmost daintiness in white, threw her umbrella and dusty coat on the\\r\\nspotless counterpane, exclaiming: \"What a lovely room!\" It was not lovely\\r\\nwhen she left it. The wall was defaced by marks made by scratching\\r\\nmatches; the bureau scarf was blackened by the curling-iron; there were\\r\\nink spots on the hemstitched sheets where she had written letters in bed,\\r\\nand something that would not come out was spilled on the table cover. It\\r\\ndoes not show that you are accustomed to nice things to be so negligent\\r\\nand careless; it shows you are not accustomed to them and do not know how\\r\\nto treat them; and it makes you a visitor the hostess is glad to get rid\\r\\nof, and never invites again.\\r\\n\\r\\n[716 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe guest, young or old, should take herself out of the way part of the\\r\\ntime; she shouldn\\'t be always in evidence. Let her go to her own room and\\r\\nwrite letters, read, or take her work out of doors; in other words, show\\r\\nan ability to entertain herself which releases her hostess from that\\r\\nresponsibility for the time being. This is much better than having one\\'s\\r\\nfriend in one\\'s constant presence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOutside Acquaintance.--If one is staying with a friend and has other\\r\\nacquaintances in the same place she will naturally expect them to call on\\r\\nher. If her callers are strangers to her hostess, they should ask for her.\\r\\nThe hostess may see them or ask to be excused with equal propriety. The\\r\\nguest is at liberty to accept outside invitations which do not include her\\r\\nhostess, but should always consult her in reference to them. She has no\\r\\nright to invite any of her friends to a meal without first mentioning her\\r\\nwish to her hostess and securing a cordial acquiescence. She must not make\\r\\na convenience of her friend\\'s house, and if a girl or young woman, she\\r\\nmust not receive there any man or woman of whom her parents disapprove.\\r\\nThis is disloyal to them, and an imposition upon her hostess.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOther Points to Observe.--If a visitor can play, sing, recite, tell\\r\\nstories, or in any way contribute to the pleasure of her friends or other\\r\\nguests, she should comply cheerfully with requests that she do so. On the\\r\\nother hand, she should not monopolize the piano. She should enter readily\\r\\ninto any plans proposed for her entertainment; even though they may not be\\r\\nespecially agreeable, she should subscribe to the kindly intent.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe question as to how much assistance the visitor should volunteer in\\r\\ncase her hostess keeps but one servant, or does her own work, is dependent\\r\\nupon circumstances. She certainly shouldn\\'t follow her hostess all over\\r\\nthe house with offers of help: \"Can\\'t I do this?\" \"Shan\\'t I do that?\" Let\\r\\nher quickly and unostentatiously render such small services as are helpful\\r\\nwithout being obtrusive. She may care for her own room; she may fill the\\r\\nvases with flowers; she may tell stories to the children or take them for\\r\\na walk, but she must carefully respect the hostess\\'s privacy and not\\r\\nintrude in the rear regions where the domestic rites are performed,\\r\\nwithout her hostess\\'s permission. And whatever aid she renders she should\\r\\ngive according to her hostess\\'s method, not her own.\\r\\n\\r\\nA visitor should carefully avoid any comment on the cook\\'s failures,\\r\\nshould such occur; she must not criticise the children\\'s manners: nor\\r\\nreprove them; nor should she criticise the chance caller or visitor, who\\r\\nis a friend of her hostess, but not of her acquaintance. Above all she\\r\\nmust avoid comparisons. If she has been visiting more wealthy people it is\\r\\nnot good form to wax eloquent over the elegance of their establishment or\\r\\ntheir more expensive mode of entertaining.\\r\\n\\r\\n[MANNERS AND SOCIAL CUSTOMS 717]\\r\\n\\r\\nConcerning Departure.--If there has been no time named as the length of\\r\\nher visit, she should take an early opportunity to mention now long she\\r\\nwill remain \"if perfectly convenient.\" And it is almost invariably a\\r\\nmistake to remain beyond the date named. Better go, and have your\\r\\ndeparture regretted, than linger to find the later days give a flat ending\\r\\nand you and your hostess alike relieved at parting.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is customary, on leaving, to give a small fee to the maid who has cared\\r\\nfor one\\'s room, and to the waitress, if one is employed. Anyone who has\\r\\nrendered personal service is generally remembered. A dollar is usually\\r\\ngiven at the close of a week\\'s visit: something depends upon the style of\\r\\nthe household. Men generally tip the chauffeur.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter having been received as a guest in a family it is the height of\\r\\nincivility and bad manners to criticise their mode of living, discuss the\\r\\npeculiarities of any member, or make unkind remarks in reference to a\\r\\nslight, real or fancied, or any negligence or oversight. Having eaten your\\r\\nhostess\\'s salt, there is an obligation of silence imposed, unless one can\\r\\nspeak in terms of praise.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAt Home Again.--Immediately after one\\'s return home it is obligatory to\\r\\nwrite what is sometimes called \"the bread-and-butter letter\"--that in\\r\\nwhich one expresses her pleasure in the visit and her appreciation of the\\r\\nhospitality received. A serviceable form for this follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n   My Dear Mrs. Blank:\\r\\n     I wish to tell you at once how much I enjoyed my visit to your\\r\\n   charming home and how truly I appreciate all you did to make my stay so\\r\\n   pleasant. I shall always remember my good times with you, and\\r\\n   especially that most delightful picnic to Ferndale.\\r\\n\\r\\n   With kind remembrances to Mr. Blank and to Lois, who helped so much to\\r\\n   make me happy, believe me,\\r\\n                              Yours most sincerely,\\r\\n                                                   Mary Annesley.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis recognition of hospitality enjoyed must on no account be omitted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nVISITING ETIQUETTE FOR GIRLS.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe best personal asset a girl can have is \"nice manners;\" they will\\r\\ncontribute more to her lasting popularity than beauty or wealth. Girls\\r\\nsometimes wonder how it happens that a girl they have regarded as \"too\\r\\nhomely\" to be accounted dangerous, still carries off the matrimonial prize\\r\\nof \"her set.\" Ten chances to one it is because she has that charm of\\r\\nmanner that makes a man overlook her physical deficiencies. Her manners,\\r\\nin such case, are the spontaneous expression of a kind and generous\\r\\ndisposition, aided, of course, by a familiarity with the social code that\\r\\nprevents awkwardness. She has ease, and that puts others at their ease;\\r\\nshe is companionable; and not being engrossed by her own good looks, she\\r\\nhas had time to cultivate the intellectual graces.\\r\\n\\r\\n[718 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nNothing is more becoming to a young girl than respect and deference to her\\r\\nelders. If for no other reason than that it gives observers an unfavorable\\r\\nopinion of her manners, she should avoid any disrespect or rudeness toward\\r\\nher parents or older sisters. The young girl is often negligent in this\\r\\nrespect. Her own ego is exaggerated, owing to her youth and inexperience;\\r\\nshe thinks\\r\\n\\r\\n    \"What there is to know, I know it;\\r\\n    What I don\\'t know isn\\'t knowledge;\"\\r\\n\\r\\nand is much inclined to dub her own mother \"old-fashioned.\" So she\\r\\ncontradicts her, precedes her in entering a room, takes the easiest chair,\\r\\nmonopolizes the conversation, and in other disrespectful ways endeavors to\\r\\nassert her own importance. Instead of crediting her with more social\\r\\nexperience, bystanders consider her a very crude and untrained young\\r\\nperson.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDeference to Age.--One reason why convent training is so highly esteemed\\r\\nin our best circles is because girls are taught such beautiful manners. No\\r\\nconvent-bred girl would think of showing the slightest disrespect to an\\r\\nolder person. They are taught all the little matters of etiquette that\\r\\ncontribute to gentle and refined manners. A lady staying at a large summer\\r\\nhotel noted the charming manners of a young Southern girl, especially in\\r\\nregard to the unfailing deference paid to her mother and aunt. She rose\\r\\nwhen they addressed her and remained standing during the conversation.\\r\\nWhen the aunt came to the breakfast table the girl rose, standing until\\r\\nthe elder lady was seated; if her mother entered one of the reception\\r\\nrooms she excused herself if conversing and advanced to meet her, finding\\r\\na seat for her and perhaps asking permission to introduce an acquaintance.\\r\\nAnd it was all done so easily, so naturally, that it was plainly seen\\r\\nthere was no affectation, but the unstudied courtesy due to good-breeding.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the other hand, girls who undertake to show their respect for their\\r\\nseniors sometimes overdo the matter. No elderly person likes to be \"fussed\\r\\nover.\" She doesn\\'t want someone continually thrusting a cushion behind her\\r\\nshoulders or insisting on providing a foot-stool. The unwelcome service\\r\\nprovokes a little resentment. One must have an intuitive sense of what to\\r\\ndo and when to do it, and tact enough to perform a trifling service\\r\\nwithout the appearance of saying \"See me! how polite I am!\" As young men\\r\\nshould rise when an elderly woman enters the room, so a young girl may pay\\r\\nthe same pretty deference to her mother or an acquaintance. She should be\\r\\ncareful not to take precedence of older women, not to interrupt them when\\r\\nspeaking, and to render any small service unobtrusively.\\r\\n\\r\\n[MANNERS AND SOCIAL CUSTOMS 719]\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE YOUNG GIRL\\'S SOCIAL AFFAIRS.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no special code of etiquette for girls. Why should they be\\r\\ntrained in one code, only to discard it for another when they enter\\r\\nsociety? Their etiquette is simply more informal. Until they are \"out,\"\\r\\nthey do not give formal invitations. Their functions are chiefly\\r\\nluncheons, invitations being given by telephone or personal notes, and the\\r\\nmenu more simple. They may give theatre parties, but never without a\\r\\nchaperon. They do not invite young men to call on them; that is their\\r\\nmother\\'s duty. They do not send written invitations to young men; these\\r\\nare in the mother\\'s name. Thus:\\r\\n\\r\\n   My Dear Mr. Smith:\\r\\n     My mother wishes me to say that it will give her much\\r\\n   pleasure if you will spend Friday evening, March tenth, with us,\\r\\n   quite informally. We hope to see you at eight o\\' clock.\\r\\n                                Yours sincerely,\\r\\n                                                Mary Gray.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch an invitation presupposes the presence of other guests. If for cards,\\r\\nor music or games, mention may be made of the proposed entertainment.\\r\\n\\r\\nA girl should not receive calls from young men without the presence of\\r\\nsome member of the family, her mother by preference, at some time during\\r\\nthe evening. A young man should not feel that the girl he calls upon is\\r\\nnot properly looked after by her parents.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Girl and the Chaperon.--Youth scorns the chaperon, regarding her as\\r\\nsuperfluous. \"I can look out for myself,\" is the young girl\\'s motto. Yet\\r\\nscandal has dimmed the fair name of many a girl through her disinclination\\r\\nto submit to proper chaperonage. The chaperon is much more of a social\\r\\nnecessity in the East than she is in the South and West. If a girl\\r\\nproposes to \"look ant for herself,\" there are some things she must\\r\\ncarefully abstain from doing. She must not go to a restaurant with a young\\r\\nman alone; she must not travel about with him alone, even if she is\\r\\nengaged to him; she must not go \"on excursions\" unattended, nor go for a\\r\\nride with a man and stop anywhere for refreshments; indeed, she should not\\r\\naccept such an invitation unless another couple or another girl are\\r\\nincluded in the party. This is not prudery; it is protection; and any\\r\\nyoung man\\'s acquaintance is not desirable if he objects to such\\r\\narrangements. He would not permit his sister to do what he asks some other\\r\\nman\\'s sister to do. A young man loses in respect for a girl if she holds\\r\\nherself cheap.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf a girl receives invitations of the character just mentioned, it is far\\r\\nbetter to say frankly \"My father (or mother) does not allow me to accept,\"\\r\\nthan to make excuses or plead previous engagements time after time.\\r\\n\\r\\n[720 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Girl and the Young Man.--Do not ask a young man to call on the\\r\\noccasion of your first meeting. Young people often meet and make each\\r\\nother\\'s acquaintance when the girl\\'s mother, whose place it is to give the\\r\\ninvitation to call, is not present. After several meetings the girl,\\r\\nhaving ascertained the young man\\'s antecedents, may say, if he seems\\r\\ndesirous of the invitation, \"\\'My mother will be glad to know you,\" or\\r\\n\"Mother and I will be pleased to have you call some evening.\" The young\\r\\nman should acknowledge the compliment by calling at an early date, and\\r\\nshould meet the girl\\'s mother, The girl does not suggest when he shall\\r\\ncall, though she may mention that she receives calls on a certain evening.\\r\\nShe must not give him her card; if he is not sufficiently interested to\\r\\nremember her address he probably does not intend to call.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is not correct for girls to suggest a walk, ride, hint a wish to dance\\r\\nor row, or tacitly invite a tete-a-tete. Let those who wish such favors\\r\\nask for them. The girl who shows herself most anxious for young men\\'s\\r\\nattentions generally receives fewest. Despite \"the woman\\'s movement,\" man\\r\\nstill insists on his privilege of taking the initiative.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout Gifts.--It is not correct form for a girl to receive presents from\\r\\nyoung men, aside from flowers, candy and an occasional book or piece of\\r\\nmusic. In some circles, to offer a girl a piece of jewelry would be\\r\\nconsidered insulting. Not until he is engaged to her may a man offer\\r\\nexpensive presents. This rule, it is lamentably true, is often violated by\\r\\na certain order of young persons, who rather boast of the gifts of their\\r\\ngallants, and are thus the object of rather unkind criticism.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a rule, a girl makes a mistake when she sends a gift to a young man. It\\r\\nis generally something that is as superfluous to him as a fifth wheel to a\\r\\nwagon, and it entails an irksome sense of obligation. It is presumed, if\\r\\nhe has been very courteous and shown her many attentions, that it has been\\r\\nhis pleasure to do so, and her gracious acceptance and pleasure in them is\\r\\nsufficient reward. A girl may give Christmas and birthday gifts to her\\r\\nfiance, but he should not give her any article of wearing apparel except\\r\\ngloves.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Telephone.--A girl should be chary of calling up her young men\\r\\nacquaintances by telephone. If forced to do so, she should make her\\r\\ncommunication as brief as possible. It is annoying to a young man to be\\r\\ncalled from his business to answer social or \"nonsense\" calls--the latter\\r\\nwhen some idle, ennuied or \"smitten\" girl takes a notion she would like to\\r\\nchatter to somebody awhile. It exasperates an employer to have his men\\r\\ncalled from their duties to answer such calls, and fellow employees are\\r\\nlikely to \"guy\" the man about his \"mash.\" The \"note habit\" is just about\\r\\nas bad, though not quite as annoying, as the telephone habit, because a\\r\\nman can carry such missives in his pocket unopened.\\r\\n\\r\\nA wise girl will not give her photograph to any young man until she is\\r\\nengaged to him. What nice girl would care to see her picture neighbored by\\r\\nballet dancers and footlight favorites in a young man\\'s rooms! She will be\\r\\nequally careful about corresponding with men, writing to but a few\\r\\nintimate and long-known friends, making her letters bright and gay, but\\r\\ncarefully avoiding any warmer expressions of regard than those warranted\\r\\nby the friendship. Many a girl has bitterly regretted the affectionate\\r\\nmissives sent to some young man who made \"werry fierce love\" to her for a\\r\\ntime, and whose regard afterward cooled. When the man she truly loves\\r\\ncomes along, she would give her most precious jewel to get those letters\\r\\ninto her hands again. It is a great deal safer not to write them.\\r\\n\\r\\nA young woman, receiving back her letters at the close of a mistaken\\r\\nengagement, once said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I sat down on the floor and read them over, and I tell you I was proud of\\r\\nmyself. There wasn\\'t one I wouldn\\'t have been willing to have my father\\r\\nread--and you know what I think of my father!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n[MANNERS AND SOCIAL CUSTOMS 721]\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE DEBUTANTE.\\r\\n\\r\\nA large number of young girls enter society without formal introductions.\\r\\nAfter leaving school, they assume their social responsibilities with no\\r\\nformality. It is seldom that a girl enters the social world under\\r\\neighteen, or over twenty-two. The early appearance implies no college\\r\\ncareer; the later, that, she has spent several years at college or\\r\\nfinishing school.\\r\\n\\r\\nIncreasingly, however, it is becoming the custom to introduce the young\\r\\naspirant for social recognition at some function given in her honor. This\\r\\nmay be a ball, a reception, a \"coming-out party,\" a dinner, a tea, at\\r\\nwhich the debutante is introduced to the older members of the circle in\\r\\nwhich she will move. Whereas her associates heretofore have been young\\r\\nfolk of her own age, she now meets the people of all ages who constitute\\r\\nwhat we call society. Her circle of acquaintances will be much enlarged,\\r\\nand her breeding will be judged by the manner in which she accepts her new\\r\\nobligations.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA Grave Mistake.--The greatest mistake the debutante can make is to treat\\r\\nwith carelessness and lack of respect the matrons, young or old, to whom\\r\\nshe is introduced. In the arrogance of her youth and ignorance she may\\r\\nthink them \"old frumps\" and devote herself to her mates in age and\\r\\ninexperience. But the \"old frumps\" hold the trump cards; she will be\\r\\ndependent on them for invitations to many pleasant little functions,\\r\\nespecially those exclusive affairs to which it is an honor to be invited,\\r\\nand if she is not personally agreeable, there will always be some one else\\r\\nto take the place that might have been hers, for a chaperon often\\r\\ninfluences a young man\\'s invitations. Moreover, by her disrespect for age\\r\\nand position she advertises her lack of good breeding and social training.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHer Dress.--The debutante dresses in white at her \"coming-out party,\" as a\\r\\nrule; white being supposed to typify her virginal attitude in the social\\r\\nrealm. The mother receives her guests with her daughter standing at her\\r\\nside. It is not uncommon for two girls of about the same age who are close\\r\\nfriends to be introduced at the same function. The celebrant\\'s friends\\r\\nsend flowers; sometimes the number of bouquets is so great that a screen\\r\\nis arranged behind her on which they are displayed. Girls pique themselves\\r\\non the number of such tributes.\\r\\n\\r\\n[722 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nIf Not a Belle.--But suppose a girl is not pretty enough, nor rich enough,\\r\\nnor attractive enough to become a social success. She will suffer\\r\\ncountless mortifications. In society, as in business, \"Nothing succeeds\\r\\nlike success.\" If she is popular, she will have a very happy time as\\r\\ndebutante. If she is not \"a success,\" her chaperon will despair of her.\\r\\nShe will be partnerless when other girls have too many; she will have to\\r\\nretire to the dressing-room, deeply humiliated because unescorted to the\\r\\nsupper-room. She will be a wall-flower while others dance. Young men are\\r\\nvery selfish; unless a girl has some claim to consideration, personally,\\r\\nor they expect invitations through her parents, they often will selfishly\\r\\nneglect her.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat shall she do in such a case? She will be happier and more contented\\r\\nto give up the losing fight, find some sphere that is congenial, and\\r\\ndetermine to adorn it. There are many kinds of belles; she may make\\r\\nherself a belle of the home, a belle in out-door sports, a queen of the\\r\\nchafing-dish. Far better these humbler triumphs than neglect and\\r\\nunhappiness in the social world.\\r\\n\\r\\nA girl looks forward to her debut with many joyous anticipations, but\\r\\noften finds her second social season a happier one than her first. She is\\r\\nmore sure of herself, less shy and reserved; little things--the small\\r\\nmistakes made through ignorance--do not worry her so much; she has gained\\r\\nease and grace of manner, having shed her self-consciousness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE ETIQUETTE OF BALLS.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dinner dances\" have largely taken the place of balls, the latter having\\r\\nseemingly passed into the hands of clubs and assemblies or being known as\\r\\n\"subscription dances.\" One must have a very large house, with ball-room,\\r\\nto give a ball successfully, so it is customary to engage private\\r\\napartments at some fashionable restaurant or hotel, where there are\\r\\naccommodations for such an affair.\\r\\n\\r\\nInvitations are formal, and of course engraved. If a debutante is to be\\r\\npresented her card may or may not be, but usually is, enclosed with the\\r\\ninvitation. The patronesses of a subscription dance are entitled to\\r\\ninvitations which they send to their friends, enclosing their card. The\\r\\nword \"ball\" never appears on an invitation; its nature is indicated by\\r\\n\"Cotillion,\" the fashionable name for what was called \"the German.\" The\\r\\nhostess or hostesses stand near the entrance to the ball-room, and should\\r\\nsee that the guests receive a fair amount of attention. The supper is\\r\\nprovided by a caterer, of course. Two orchestras, playing alternately,\\r\\nprovide music; they are screened behind palms and other plants. Balls\\r\\ngenerally begin about eleven o\\'clock, the hour named on the cards being\\r\\nhalf after ten, and everybody waiting in the hope that someone else may\\r\\narrive earlier. General dancing is in order until supper is served;\\r\\nafterwards the cotillion is danced.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the dinner dance, the cotillion is preceded by a dinner, given by the\\r\\nhostess at her own house, or by several hostesses at some restaurant,\\r\\nwhere each presides over a table. Dinner and subscription dances are much\\r\\nfavored by the younger set, as the hostesses act in the capacity of\\r\\nchaperons, and the company is gayer.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo bid one\\'s hostess good night--or good morning--and express one\\'s\\r\\npleasure in her entertainment is obligatory.\\r\\n\\r\\n[MANNERS AND SOCIAL CUSTOMS 723]\\r\\n\\r\\nGARDEN PARTIES.\\r\\n\\r\\nJupiter Pluvius apparently has a grouch against garden-parties, so often\\r\\ndoes he shake his sieve with deliberate intent to spoil the affair, which\\r\\nis after all, merely afternoon tea out of doors. The hostess anxiously\\r\\nconsults \"the probabilities\" as to weather, and if storm threatens must\\r\\nhastily convert her garden fete into an in-door function. If blessed with\\r\\na bright day, a garden party is a pretty affair. The women wear beautiful\\r\\nlight gowns, en train by preference, and their flower-laden hats and gay\\r\\nparasols contribute to the charm of the scene.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe garden-party is the special prerogative of the out-of-town hostess.\\r\\nShe has the lawn and the trees without which a party of this character\\r\\ncannot be undertaken. Invitations may be formal, or the hostess may use\\r\\nher card with the hour and the date and \"Garden Party\" written in the\\r\\nlower left hand corner. If guests from a distance are expected to arrive\\r\\nby train or trolley they must be notified of the train or car which will\\r\\nbe met by carriages or automobiles she provides.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hostess receives on the lawn, and hats are retained. Games, like lawn\\r\\ntennis, archery, croquet, should be provided. Guests wander about and\\r\\nentertain each other, and seek the refreshment tables when so inclined.\\r\\nThe supper may be served under a tent or in the house. Seats are provided,\\r\\nand rugs spread on the grass. No matter if the weather is unfavorable the\\r\\nguests are expected to present themselves, as the hostess will quickly\\r\\ntransform her out-door fete into an in-door affair in case of rain.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRefreshments.--A hostess is not expected to use her best china and linen\\r\\nat a garden party. She should have an ample supply of napkins, plates,\\r\\ncups and silver, but the expense of hiring them from a caterer is offset\\r\\nby the danger of breakage and loss.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe may serve salads, sandwiches, cakes, ices and ice creams, fruit, and\\r\\nclaret cup; or sandwiches, cakes, ice cream and lemonade and fruit punch.\\r\\nHot tea should be provided for those who prefer it, especially if rain\\r\\ndrives the guests in-doors. The young matrons are invited to pour it. The\\r\\nmaids should remove soiled dishes and napkins promptly, and keep the\\r\\ntables looking fresh. Music is usually provided.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAT SMALL ENTERTAINMENTS.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany small, informal entertainments are more enjoyable than those larger\\r\\naffairs given for the purpose of paying off social debts. Good will and\\r\\njollity prevail, and people \"go in for a good time.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n[724 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nCard Parties.--The most stringent rule of etiquette at a card-party is to\\r\\nbe punctual, that the tables may be filled up in good season. The second\\r\\nrule is to keep good-natured, even if your partner fails to return your\\r\\nlead or trumps your ace. Some people make themselves very disagreeable\\r\\nover cards, and are avoided as partners. If unfortunate enough to be\\r\\npaired off with such a person, at least control your own annoyance.\\r\\n\\r\\nNever descend to the meanness of telegraphing information, hinting at your\\r\\npreferences in the way of trumps, overlooking a neighbor\\'s hand, or taking\\r\\nany unfair advantage. A prize thus won is no honor. Nor do such violations\\r\\nof good breeding pass unnoticed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the Party.--If one accepts an invitation to a card party she is\\r\\nsupposed to have sufficient proficiency to play the game proposed with\\r\\nsome degree of credit; otherwise she should promptly send regrets.\\r\\nInvitations may be formal or informal, or the hostess may send her card\\r\\nwith \"Bridge, at half after two o\\'clock,\" or \"Euchre,\" or \"Five Hundred,\"\\r\\nwritten upon it. Replies are to be sent at once. Many such invitations are\\r\\ngiven by telephone. The guests are assigned to tables by the hostess, the\\r\\nnames being written at the top of the scorecards. Two packs of cards are\\r\\non each table, and small pencils attached to the score-cards. Playing\\r\\nbegins when all are present. Or the hostess may fill the tables as the\\r\\nguests arrive, begin playing at the stated time, and assign late comers to\\r\\nplaces as they come in. Hats are kept on at an afternoon card-party. The\\r\\nusual limit for playing is two hours. The \"progressive\" fashion requires\\r\\nthe providing of two prizes, the first prize and a consolation prize for\\r\\nthe person having the lowest score. If prizes are given at each table they\\r\\nshould be duplicates. These prizes are wrapped up in tissue paper and tied\\r\\nwith ribbons, and are to be opened at once, displayed, and the hostess\\r\\ncordially thanked. It is not good form to be ostentatiously generous in\\r\\nthe matter of prizes, nor should guests show themselves too eager to win.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is customary to engage card tables and chairs for such an\\r\\nentertainment. The refreshments are served on these tables. Punch is\\r\\nsometimes served while the game is in progress.\\r\\n\\r\\nVery often the hostess invites some of her friends who do not play cards\\r\\nto come in for refreshments at half after four or five o\\'clock.\\r\\n\\r\\nRefreshments should not be too elaborate for either afternoon or evening\\r\\ncard-parties. Sandwiches, coffee, and small cakes, or ices and cake, for\\r\\nthe afternoon; salad of some kind with coffee, olives, and some sweet or\\r\\nfancy wafer, for evening. Men enjoy an oyster stew served hot in the\\r\\ndining room.\\r\\n\\r\\n[MANNERS AND SOCIAL CUSTOMS 725]\\r\\n\\r\\nYOUNG GIRLS\\' PARTIES.\\r\\n\\r\\nUntil a girl is formally launched in society, her parties are of the\\r\\nsimplest and most informal kind. She will invite a few friends to tea, or\\r\\nto a card-party, giving informal invitations and confining them to her\\r\\nschool friends and most intimate acquaintances. Games, music, and the like\\r\\nare the usual amusements. Properly chaperoned, she may give a small\\r\\ntheater party.\\r\\n\\r\\nBirthday Party.--The largest of her social functions will probably be her\\r\\nbirthday party. For this, her birthday flower will be chosen for\\r\\ndecorations. Her young friends may give her little presents. Once in a\\r\\nseason she may be invited to a small dance given for some schoolmate. This\\r\\nshe will attend, prettily and simply gowned, and properly chaperoned. On\\r\\nno account will she go alone in a carriage, or with a young man alone. If\\r\\nshe is a well bred girl she will not pique herself in dancing every dance,\\r\\nnor \"split the dances\" into fragments to please those who wish to dance\\r\\nwith her. She will be careful not to romp nor laugh too loud; nor to\\r\\npermit herself to be held too closely in dancing, nor be served too often\\r\\nwith punch.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"STAG\" DINNERS.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe woman who wishes to give her husband a birthday party or anniversary\\r\\nwill not go amiss if she makes it a \"stag dinner\"--that is, a dinner for\\r\\nmen only.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo this she invites as many of his men friends as she can accommodate, and\\r\\nprovides a good, substantial meal, without any \"frills.\" It need not be\\r\\nelaborate if everything is good of its kind, well cooked and served hot.\\r\\nThe menu may include oysters, roast fowl, two vegetables, several\\r\\nrelishes, and an entree, with some simple dessert and good coffee. She\\r\\nwill also see to it that the cigars are of the proper excellence. It is\\r\\noptional whether she sits at the table till the coffee and cigars are\\r\\nserved, or stays in the kitchen to superintend the serving. Red is the\\r\\nmost appropriate color for decorations, since a man\\'s ideas of color are\\r\\nusually rather crude. Men always enjoy a dinner of this kind. The evening\\r\\nmay conclude with cards.\\r\\n\\r\\nA stag card-party sometimes takes the place of a dinner; it is followed by\\r\\na substantial supper.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE MUSICAL AND INFORMAL TEA.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt a musical, guests are seated, the hostess remaining near the door to\\r\\nwelcome late arrivals. If these arrive while a selection is in progress,\\r\\nthey stand till it is finished, then find seats. Guests do not leave their\\r\\nseats during the intermission, but converse with those in the vicinity.\\r\\nRefreshments are always served. Hats are removed.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a very informal tea the hostess sends her card with the date and hour\\r\\nwritten across the lower corner. If a friend is staying with her, she may\\r\\nwrite \"to meet Mrs. A.\" at the top. She will offer a cup of tea and cakes\\r\\nor wafers to each comer, or may ask some friend to do so for her, leaving\\r\\nher free to mingle with her visitors. Simplicity and informality\\r\\ncharacterize this form of receiving friends.\\r\\n\\r\\n[726 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nETIQUETTE FOR CHILDREN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The future destiny of the child is always the work of the mother.\"\\r\\n--Bonaparte.\\r\\n\\r\\nChildren reflect the manners of their homes. As they learn to talk after\\r\\nthe fashion of their parents\\' speech, so they learn to be polite by\\r\\nexample, aided by training, and in both cases the habit of youth persists\\r\\nin greater or less degree all through life.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo train children properly requires patience and persistence, but to have\\r\\npolite children, and to feel that they know what to do and how to do it\\r\\nwhen they begin to go out, is certainly a great source of satisfaction to\\r\\na mother, on whom the burden of training falls.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe secret of success is beginning early. Before the baby is three years\\r\\nold he should be in process of training. When he comes into the use of\\r\\nspoon, knife and fork, he should be taught how to hold these properly, and\\r\\nhow to feed himself. He should never be permitted to play with his food;\\r\\nout of that baby habit comes the later playing with crumbs, holding the\\r\\nfork in the hand when not eating, drinking tea from a spoon, and other\\r\\nlittle gaucheries resorted to in embarrassment or preoccupation. It is not\\r\\nnecessary to wait until a child is ten or twelve years old before teaching\\r\\nhim not to interrupt a conversation, and to make his wants known quietly\\r\\nand without iteration, nor yet that your yea means yea, and your nay, nay.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst Lessons.--The mother\\'s first lesson is usually in regard to taking\\r\\noff his hat or cap. Teach him to remove this as soon as he enters the\\r\\nhouse, as soon as he begins to go out of doors alone, and the habit will\\r\\nbecome life-long. It is very charming to see a child of either sex rise to\\r\\nopen the door for a visitor, or stand while she talks to him. One often\\r\\nsees boys of seven, nine and eleven years of age occupying the seats in a\\r\\ncar while the ladies stand. No mother should permit this.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhether a child should say \"father\" and \"mother,\" or use the more babyish\\r\\nform of \"papa\" and \"mama\" is a matter of parental choice, but the\\r\\npreference in some circles is for the former. A blunt \"yes\" or \"no\" is not\\r\\nthought polite from a child; he should say \"yes, father,\" \"no, mama,\"\\r\\n\"yes, Mrs. Smith.\" \"Ma\\'am\" as a form of address is quite obsolete.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost parents make the mistake of believing their children as absorbingly\\r\\ninteresting to other people as they are to them, and bring them forward so\\r\\nprominently that they become tiresome. A good rule is for the mother to\\r\\nallow children to greet the visitor and then send them away to their play.\\r\\nThe spectacle of a little child primly seated on a chair and \"taking in\"\\r\\nthe conversation with eyes and ears is not wholly edifying; while to allow\\r\\na child to hang on a visitor or monopolize the attention makes the\\r\\nyoungster a nuisance.\\r\\n\\r\\n      MANNERS AND SOCIAL CUSTOMS       727\\r\\n\\r\\nCHILDREN\\'S PARTIES.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is nothing children love better than a party. It takes so little to\\r\\nmake them happy that the exertion is well repaid by their pleasure. A few\\r\\ngames, a light supper, an inexpensive souvenir, and they have had \"a\\r\\nperfectly splendid time.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFor children from five to twelve, the best hours for a party are from\\r\\nthree to half past five. This gives time for all to return home by six\\r\\no\\'clock. Few mothers wish to have their children out evenings at that age.\\r\\nWhere the children are old enough they should write their own invitations.\\r\\nThey should receive their guests themselves, the mother standing in the\\r\\nbackground to see that they do it properly and to second their welcome.\\r\\nThe little host or hostess should early learn the lesson that she must\\r\\nstudy the pleasure of her guests, not her own, and be taught the\\r\\ncourtesies required of her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGames.--The first thing is the games, which are suitable to the children\\'s\\r\\nage. Little ones play romping games, like \"Cat and Mouse,\" \"London\\r\\nBridge,\" etc.; those a little older enjoy a peanut hunt or a peanut race,\\r\\nor supplying the donkey with a caudal appendage. Many novel games are\\r\\npossible. Or the children may be asked to a doll\\'s party, or an animal\\r\\nparty. To the one they bring their favorite doll; to the other their teddy\\r\\nbears and cotton elephants.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSupper.--The supper should be simple. Sandwiches, cocoa, jellies, and\\r\\nfancy cookies not too rich. After the supper they may dance \"Sir Roger de\\r\\nCoverley,\" or some simple form all know, and then little souvenirs may be\\r\\ndistributed in a way that leads to a hunt. Notes are written and put in a\\r\\nbag; each child takes one; the note directs where to look. All rush pell\\r\\nmell to that spot. There they find directions to look somewhere else, and\\r\\nfinally each gets a little card or a note directing a search at some\\r\\nparticular place, say in a basket in the hall or in the dining room, where\\r\\neach finds and unwraps a little gift. Or a large paper sack filled with\\r\\nwrapped bonbons is hung between folding doors, each child blindfolded in\\r\\nturn, given a cane and instructed to hit the sack if he can. Presently the\\r\\npaper is broken and the youngsters scramble for the contents. Each little\\r\\nguest should thank the giver of the party and the mother for the pleasure\\r\\nenjoyed. The little host or hostess should stand where they can make their\\r\\nadieus, for it is no longer proper to \"take French leave\" on any occasion\\r\\nexcept \"a crush.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGames for Older Children.--Older children enjoy a peanut hunt, or a spider\\r\\nparty where they follow a twine through a labyrinth of loopings and find a\\r\\nsmall prize at the end, or a book party, where each guest represents the\\r\\ntitle of some book. Thus Ouida\\'s \"Under Two Flags\" could be very easily\\r\\nrepresented. Young folks always enjoy \"dressing up,\" and any hostess can\\r\\neither find directions for some form of fancy dress, or invent something\\r\\nnew for herself. St. Valentine\\'s Day, St. Patrick\\'s Day, May Day, the\\r\\nFourth of July, Hallowe\\'en, have their traditional decorations, and games,\\r\\nand suggest their own refreshments. Elaborate refreshments have rather\\r\\ngone out of style.\\r\\n\\r\\n[728  MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nCONCERNING ENGAGEMENTS.\\r\\n\\r\\nA marriage engagement is one of the most serious contracts into which\\r\\nyoung people can enter, second only to actual marriage. It is not to be\\r\\nlightly entered upon. It is no credit to a girl to have been several times\\r\\naffianced; indeed, it almost invariably occasions unfavorable comment.\\r\\nThere may be reasons for breaking one engagement, but when it comes to the\\r\\nsecond, Mrs. Grundy makes remarks, and is inclined to blame the girl,\\r\\neither for too great haste to wed, or for being fickle and capricious,\\r\\n\\r\\nA girl should be very sure of herself before she gives her promise. She\\r\\nmust respect the man, and have faith and confidence in him, and not permit\\r\\nherself to be carried away by considerations of wealth and position. If\\r\\nthere is anything about him she dislikes, she may be sure dislike will\\r\\nbecome aversion after marriage, unless she has a genuine affection for\\r\\nhim.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nParental Wishes.--She should not engage herself without consulting her\\r\\nparents. Where can she find better advice than from those who have cared\\r\\nfor her so long and faithfully? Where there is parental disapproval, a\\r\\ngirl should show her respect for her parents\\' opinion by avoiding a hasty\\r\\ndecision. Men know men much better than women can ever know them; and the\\r\\nopposition of a father or older brother should have due consideration.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn these days and in this country, young women take their matrimonial\\r\\naffairs into their own hands. \"In the good old times\" the young man asked\\r\\nthe consent of the girl\\'s parents before he was sure of her sentiments\\r\\ntoward him; he asked permission to woo, and if in his eagerness he\\r\\nforestalled the etiquette of the occasion she modestly referred him to her\\r\\nparents, first indicating her consent would accompany theirs. In the\\r\\ntwentieth century the young people too often settle the matter between\\r\\nthemselves, and announce their intentions to wed quite regardless of their\\r\\nparents\\' sentiments on the subject. So many youthful attachments are\\r\\nreally youthful follies that the girl who submits her wishes to her\\r\\nparents\\' counsel often has reason to consider herself fortunate. Girls,\\r\\nhowever, almost invariably regard parental opposition as unreasonable;\\r\\nactually it is often founded on a better understanding of their\\r\\ntemperaments and the character of the young men in the case than they\\r\\nimagine--or in many cases can be made to see.\\r\\n\\r\\nA manly man will approach the father of the girl he wishes to make his\\r\\nwife, state his prospects, and ask the father\\'s consent. If withheld, he\\r\\nwill not urge the girl into a hasty marriage, but will wait until the\\r\\nopposition has diminished. In case this does not happen, the girl has at\\r\\nleast had an opportunity to learn her own mind. Many who have married\\r\\nagainst their parents\\' wishes have lived happily; it must be admitted that\\r\\nothers have not. Delay, at least, gives time for reason to outweigh\\r\\nromance.\\r\\n\\r\\n[MANNERS AND SOCIAL CUSTOMS 729]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is especially awkward for the girl if the parents of her fiance do not\\r\\napprove his choice. In such case she should give ample time for their\\r\\ndisapproval to have whatever effect it may on the young man\\'s feelings\\r\\ntowards her. Some girls refuse to enter a man\\'s family unless made\\r\\nwelcome.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo girl should engage herself to a man she has known but a short time;\\r\\ncertainly not without searching inquiry into his reputation in his former\\r\\nplace of residence. No man can reasonably object to such inquiries;\\r\\nindeed, he should welcome them; invite them by furnishing credentials. No\\r\\nmatter how violently in love a girl may be, she should not throw prudence\\r\\nand discretion to the winds.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nANNOUNCEMENT OF ENGAGEMENTS.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn engagement may be announced soon after it is entered upon, or not until\\r\\nseveral weeks before the marriage. Usually the engagement is known to the\\r\\ntwo families some time in advance of the later formal announcement. This\\r\\nis to save the girl embarrassment in case it is broken off. Should this\\r\\nhappen, the young man takes the blame upon himself, declaring the young\\r\\nlady discarded him. Only an out-and-out cad would intimate to anyone that\\r\\nhe \"threw her over.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe announcement of the engagement comes through the girl\\'s family; the\\r\\nman waits until it is their pleasure to make it known. The usual way is\\r\\nfor the girl and her mother to write notes to relatives and close friends.\\r\\nThe man, of course, will know when this is done, and may send notes to his\\r\\nrelatives and friends, or acquaint them by word of mouth, at the same\\r\\ndate. No special form is employed for such notes; they are always informal\\r\\nand familiar.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHow Disclosed.--Sometimes a girl announces her engagement to her most\\r\\nintimate girl friends at a small tea or luncheon her mother or some\\r\\nrelative gives for her. In this case the decorations are suggestive.\\r\\nHeart-shaped place cards, decorated with the entwined initials of the two\\r\\nparties; pink flowers, banked in heart-shape and pierced with silver\\r\\narrows, for a centerpiece, and sandwiches and cakes in heart shape, the\\r\\nlatter decorated in pink, are often used. At each plate may be a small\\r\\ncluster of pink carnations, tied with narrow ribbons, one end connecting\\r\\nwith an arrow in the centerpiece. When these are drawn out some\\r\\nappropriate sentiment is found attached, which is read aloud by the guest.\\r\\n\\r\\nAny novel form may be employed in communicating the joyous intelligence.\\r\\nMidway the repast some friend previously selected for the honor may\\r\\npropose a health to the two who are betrothed; someone may ask a moment\\'s\\r\\nindulgence while she reads an interesting paragraph from a letter, or a\\r\\nmock telegram may be delivered. Congratulations are in order; sometimes\\r\\nthe fiance has been held in reserve, and is brought in to share with his\\r\\nfiancee the good wishes of her friends.\\r\\n\\r\\n730       MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES\\r\\n\\r\\nAll who receive notes are expected to call in person or send letters of\\r\\ncongratulation. Flowers are often sent, and dinners, theater parties, and\\r\\nother entertainments given for the young couple. Engagement gifts are\\r\\noften given; china being a favorite choice, though any gift is in order.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the Announcement.--Immediately upon the announcement of the\\r\\nengagement the parents of the young man call upon his fiancee and her\\r\\nmother, whether previously acquainted or not. His family takes the\\r\\ninitiative in the exchange of hospitality which follows. Calls are to be\\r\\nreturned within a week. In case the man\\'s family live at a distance, the\\r\\nmembers should at once write cordial, kindly letters to the girl, to which\\r\\nshe must reply within a few days. She should not \"gush\" but should show\\r\\nher desire to know them, and a cordial and friendly feeling. The\\r\\nprospective mother-in-law may invite the girl to visit her. She should\\r\\nremember that no matter how welcome the alliance she is under inspection,\\r\\nas it were, and do her best, through courtesy and tact and friendliness to\\r\\ncreate a favorable impression.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Girl\\'s Behavior.--The engagement ring is not worn until the engagement\\r\\nis announced. If the young man\\'s means permit, it is usually as handsome a\\r\\ndiamond solitaire as he can afford. No womanly girl would wish her fiance\\r\\nto go in debt to purchase her ring. Should it be less handsome than she\\r\\nhad hoped or expected, she should not give the slightest evidence of\\r\\ndisappointment. That would seem mercenary and grasping. Nevertheless, a\\r\\ngirl does doubtless get much more joy out of her engagement ring than she\\r\\ndoes out of her wedding ring.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough a girl may receive from her affianced gifts of jewelry, silver,\\r\\netc., as well as the bonbons, books and flowers she was privileged to\\r\\naccept before her engagement, it is not in good taste for him to offer any\\r\\narticle of wearing apparel to her. He is not to buy clothes for her until\\r\\nafter their marriage. Nothing that cannot be returned to him uninjured in\\r\\ncase the engagement is broken is really correct for her to receive.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe will naturally receive many notes, letters, etc., from her fiance,\\r\\nespecially if he is called out of town often, or resides in another city.\\r\\nThe inexperienced, very-much-in-love girl is quite likely to write very\\r\\nardent and affectionate letters. Leave that to the man. If she knows her\\r\\nThackeray she will remember the rose-colored billet-doux poor Amelia used\\r\\nto write to her George, and which lay unopened day after day, and will\\r\\nmodel her missives upon the style of Lucy Snowe\\'s to the Professor--\"a\\r\\nmorsel of ice, flavored with ever so slight a zest of sweetness.\" Let her\\r\\nmake them bright, chatty, kindly, but not too tender.\\r\\n\\r\\n[MANNERS AND SOCIAL CUSTOMS 731]\\r\\n\\r\\nLength of Engagement.--As for the length of an engagement, it is often\\r\\nargued that if one has made a mistake, it is much better to find it out\\r\\nbefore marriage than after. A prolonged engagement, however, is not\\r\\nadvisable. It embarrasses a girl to be asked \"When is it going to be?\" and\\r\\nbe obliged to make evasive answers. Thc old saying \"Absence makes the\\r\\nheart grow fonder\" often proves untrue. The long engagement is a strain,\\r\\nundoubtedly. A year is quite long enough for the two to demonstrate their\\r\\nfidelity and for all necessary preparations.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBreaking Off.--If the two develop incompatibility, after being convinced\\r\\nit is irreconcilable the only thing to do is to sever the tie. This is\\r\\noften heart-breaking if caused by the infidelity of one party, and always\\r\\nhumiliating, especially to the girl. To spare her as much as possible, the\\r\\nman assumes the breaking-off was her act. He never allows himself to speak\\r\\nof her save in terms of the most perfect respect. The presents, letters,\\r\\npictures, are returned, and Cupid retires discomfited. The girl\\'s mother\\r\\nwrites to her friends and tells them the engagement is broken; no reason\\r\\nis given and no person of tact or knowledge of social forms will inquire\\r\\nwhy or ever allude to the matter to either of the parties to the\\r\\nengagement or their parents.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Being engaged\" does not relax etiquette. It does not justify a journey or\\r\\nan excursion together, nor appearance in public places unchaperoned.\\r\\nLovers refrain from caresses or evidence of their devotion in the presence\\r\\nof others; in short they should conduct themselves with decorum.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Wedding Trousseau.--In case everything goes well when the wedding day\\r\\nis set it is the custom to announce the engagement in the society columns\\r\\nin the newspapers. The trousseau is nearly ready, the linen chest is\\r\\nfilled, the details of the wedding settled. It is not customary now for\\r\\nthe expectant bride to have dozens and dozens of undergarments, to be laid\\r\\naside, turn yellow and go out of style. One dozen of each garment is an\\r\\nample supply for the average bride; even half a dozen new garments of each\\r\\nkind have been known to answer every purpose. She should have a moderate\\r\\nsupply of  shoes, corsets, gloves, petticoats, both silk and cambric, and\\r\\nhandkerchiefs. Fashions change so rapidly now that it is foolish to lay in\\r\\na great stock of gowns. The supply of these must be in accordance with her\\r\\nsocial position and its requirements. After she is married, she will find\\r\\nher table-cloths and napkins, sheets, and pillow slips and towels a much\\r\\ngreater source of satisfaction than a lot of passe gowns and wraps. Her\\r\\nsilver and linen are marked with the initials of her maiden name. These\\r\\ninitials are always embroidered on the latter.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe supply of table and bed-linen will depend upon the size of her house\\r\\nand the style in which she lives. Six sheets and six pillow and bolster\\r\\nslips are allowed to each bed, and twelve towels, half of them bath\\r\\ntowels, to each bedroom. She should have dinner and lunch cloths, with\\r\\nnapkins to match; it is usual to allow a dozen napkins to each cloth. It\\r\\nis good economy to purchase all these in a good quality. The dinner cloths\\r\\nand napkins should be of double damask, so called. The very large dinner\\r\\nnapkins--seven-eighths of a yard square--are less in favor than the\\r\\nmedium, three-quarter size. A fairly ample supply of comforts, down and\\r\\nsilk quilts, and blankets, is often acquired by purchase before marriage.\\r\\n\\r\\n[732  MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nWEDDING FESTIVITIES.\\r\\n\\r\\nVery soon after the wedding invitations are out, the bride\\'s friends\\r\\nbestir themselves and a number of entertainments are planned in her honor.\\r\\nThese are dinners, luncheons, teas, and theatre parties, the latter often\\r\\nprefaced by a dinner at the house of the hostess. Often these include the\\r\\nbridal party--bridesmaids and \"best man.\" To dinners and theatre parties\\r\\nthe bridegroom-to-be is invited; luncheons and teas are given by the\\r\\nbride\\'s friends to her. The bridegroom\\'s bachelor friends frequently give\\r\\na dinner for him--a farewell to the man so soon to rank as \"Benedict, the\\r\\nmarried man.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThese functions in honor of the bride are exclusive, rather than general,\\r\\ninvitations being restricted to familiar friends. The bride\\'s relatives\\r\\nare the entertainers. At such functions the bride expectant may wear one\\r\\nof the gowns of her trousseau. Because of these entertainments, which are\\r\\nreally quite a tax on the girl\\'s strength and vitality, the trousseau\\r\\nshould be complete and the wedding preparations well under way before they\\r\\nbegin. Most of them seem to be crowded into the week or ten days preceding\\r\\nthe ceremony.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEngagement \"Showers.\"--\"The shower\"--an entertainment that is somewhat on\\r\\nthe order of an informal tea at which each guest brings some gift to the\\r\\nbride--has been called \"provincial.\" It has a recognized place in middle\\r\\nclass society, at least, and may be made an enjoyable function. No two\\r\\n\"showers\" are alike, hostesses vieing with each other in the endeavor to\\r\\npresent something original and attractive. The linen shower is one of the\\r\\nmost popular, each guest bringing some contribution to the bride\\'s linen\\r\\nchest. These are the more valued if the handiwork of the giver, and some\\r\\ngirls always have a bit of work in progress which may, when finished, be\\r\\ntheir offering at a linen shower.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnly intimate friends are asked to a linen shower and the occasion is\\r\\nentirely informal. The invitations may be couched in this form:\\r\\n\\r\\n   My Dear Miss Ames--\\r\\n   I am giving a linen shower for our mutual friend, Miss Gray, who is to\\r\\n   be married next month, and would be very glad to have you with us. I am\\r\\n   asking a few friends for luncheon on Thursday, January sixth, at one\\r\\n   o\\'clock, and hope you will be able to come. As the \"shower\" is to be a\\r\\n   surprise to Miss Gray, please do not mention it should you see her.\\r\\n                                          Very cordially,\\r\\n                                                        Helen Brown.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe invitation should be promptly answered. Usually, the nature of the\\r\\nentertainment is not known to the guest of honor until she arrives;\\r\\nsometimes not until she is seated at the table.\\r\\n\\r\\n[MANNERS AND SOCIAL CUSTOMS 733]\\r\\n\\r\\nHow Presented.--The more unique the method of presentation the more\\r\\namusing the surprise of the guest. The gifts are to be neatly wrapped up\\r\\nin white tissue paper, tied with ribbons, the card of the giver being\\r\\nenclosed. Often some sentiment is written on the card, or an original\\r\\nrhyme; this the recipient reads aloud when the gift is unwrapped.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt one long remembered shower, the centerpiece was a white linen parasol,\\r\\nbeautifully embroidered and the gift of the hostess. This, open, was\\r\\nfastened upright, the block of wood which held it being hidden under\\r\\nasparagus plumosus interspersed with pink roses. Under this were arranged\\r\\nthe several packages. Between each course the guest of honor was requested\\r\\nto draw and open a parcel, the remainder being opened before leaving the\\r\\ntable. At another luncheon the gifts were brought in by a boy dressed as a\\r\\nmessenger, one at a time, as if just delivered. The surprise of the guest\\r\\nat the first delivery greatly amused her friends. One guest contributed a\\r\\nhandsome lunch cloth, another the napkins to match, each marked with\\r\\nembroidered initials. An embroidered white linen handbag, for use with a\\r\\nwhite gown, was enclosed in a box about a foot square; within this was\\r\\nanother, neatly wrapped and tied, which, opened, contained another and\\r\\nstill another, keeping expectancy at its height. The \"Jack Horner pie\" has\\r\\nbeen used, and the \"showered\" girl has been handed a white satin ribbon\\r\\nand been bidden to follow where it led her, discovering at the end the\\r\\npile of presents.\\r\\n\\r\\nGifts for a linen shower may include towels of all kinds, the monogrammed\\r\\ndamask and initialed guest towels, embroidered linen pillow slips;\\r\\ncenterpieces, doilies, bureau scarfs and many other textile gifts suggest\\r\\nthemselves. The \"kitchen shower\" suggests the useful; the handkerchief\\r\\nshower is dainty.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRefreshments.--The refreshments at such an entertainment may be as simple\\r\\nas one likes, unless the invitations are for a luncheon; in that case they\\r\\nshould be more elaborate. Chocolate and sandwiches with cake and ices;\\r\\nsandwiches, cake and coffee, are allowable. The guests are seated at a\\r\\ntable, which should be decorated with pink and white flowers. Pink\\r\\ncarnations are beautiful for this use. The guest of honor is seated at the\\r\\nhostess\\'s right hand and is served first. She must thank those who have\\r\\npresented the gifts individually, and express to her hostess her pleasure\\r\\nin the entertainment and her gratitude for the trouble she has taken for\\r\\nher.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWEDDING PREPARATIONS.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Expense of a Wedding.--It may be said at the outset that no wedding\\r\\nshould be more costly than the financial standing of the bride\\'s family\\r\\nwarrants. If the bridegroom\\'s family is wealthy, and that of the bride in\\r\\nvery moderate circumstances, there will be many to intimate that the\\r\\nbridegroom \"put up for it.\" The intimation is a sneer, because the bride\\'s\\r\\nfamily should pay all the expenses of a wedding. If the expense is\\r\\nmanifestly beyond the resources of the bride\\'s father, society lifts its\\r\\neyebrows.\\r\\n\\r\\n[734 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course her wedding is the one pageant in which the girl is the central\\r\\nfigure--the admired of all beholders. It is quite natural for her to wish\\r\\nit to be beautiful, to look lovely herself, and not to go empty-handed to\\r\\nher husband. But no sensible girl will have a grand wedding if its cost\\r\\nwill put her father in debt. If Mary\\'s music lessons must be intermitted,\\r\\nor John\\'s entrance into college postponed because of her trousseau and her\\r\\nwedding, she should assume some of the sacrifice herself and be content\\r\\nwith a more modest outfit and a simple ceremony. Thousands of thoughtless\\r\\ngirls leave their families to recover slowly from the financial strain of\\r\\ntheir wedding. It is selfish and inconsiderate for a girl to say, \"You\\r\\nwill never have to do it again for me,\" or \"I shall be no further expense\\r\\nto you.\" That may be true, but it is no justification.\\r\\n\\r\\nNor is it permissible for the bridegroom to furnish any part of the\\r\\nbride\\'s trousseau. If she is poor, and is to marry into wealth, good taste\\r\\nand public opinion counsel her to confine her wedding preparations to what\\r\\nshe or her family can pay for. Let her make ready a simple wedding dress\\r\\nand going-away gown, or be married in the latter, and take with her to her\\r\\nnew home only her under linen and the treasured keepsakes of her maiden\\r\\ndays. As soon as she is wife, her husband may lavish silks and laces and\\r\\nfurs upon her, but not before.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bride\\'s Privileges.--It is the province of the bride to name the\\r\\nwedding day, subject of course to the insistence of her fiance, who will\\r\\nurge an early date. She decides whether her wedding shall be formal or\\r\\ninformal, at church or at home. She chooses the clergyman who shall\\r\\nperform the ceremony, the bridegroom notifying him of her desire. Her\\r\\nfamily issues--and pays for--the wedding invitations and announcement\\r\\ncards. It is customary to ask the bridegroom to make out a list of those\\r\\nof his relatives and friends to whom he wishes these sent. The bride names\\r\\nher attendants, decides upon their number and if a bridal procession is\\r\\ncontemplated, consults with them as to their gowns and the accessories.\\r\\nHere she is in duty bound to consider the expense to be incurred by those\\r\\ninvited to take part in the affair, unless she is prepared to pay for\\r\\ntheir gowns herself; this however is seldom done. If she desires her\\r\\nattendants to wear some particular adornment which will be of no use to\\r\\nthem afterwards, as a fancy muff or boa, she should pay for it herself.\\r\\nShe may endeavor to arrange with her dressmaker to make their gowns if she\\r\\ncan obtain a reduction on account of their being made alike, or the large\\r\\norder placed. To be invited to serve as bridesmaid is often an expensive\\r\\ncompliment, as it usually involves a new gown and hat, the latter always\\r\\nbeing worn at a church wedding.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the bride decides to have but one attendant, the latter is usually\\r\\nstyled her maid-of-honor, and may be her sister or her most intimate\\r\\nfriend. If she has more than one maid she should include the bridegroom\\'s\\r\\nsister, if he has one. If a matron-of-honor is to participate, she should\\r\\nbe a friend or sister of the bride who has been recently wedded. The\\r\\nbridesmaids are chosen from her unmarried friends.\\r\\n\\r\\n[MANNERS AND SOCIAL CUSTOMS 735]\\r\\n\\r\\nWho Pays?--The question is often asked, \"Who pays, for\" this, that or the\\r\\nother item.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bridegroom provides the marriage certificate, the wedding ring, pays\\r\\nthe clergyman, and for the carriage in which he drives away with the\\r\\nbride. He sends a gift and the bouquet to the bride; usually gives gifts\\r\\nof jewelry to the bridesmaids and the best man, and often includes the\\r\\nushers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bride\\'s family pays for the wedding cards, pays the florist and the\\r\\ncaterer, the expense of opening the church and the service of the sexton;\\r\\nthe music, carriages for the bridal party, in short, the bills are for the\\r\\nfamily to pay. Where a wedding is very elaborate, the details are\\r\\nsometimes turned over to a \"manager,\" who sees to everything, and receives\\r\\na fat fee for his services.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Wedding Gown.--Choice of a wedding gown depends upon the style of the\\r\\nwedding. At a church wedding it is as handsome as the bride can afford.\\r\\nAny girl is excusable for wishing her wedding to be \"an occasion,\" and her\\r\\nbridal attire as beautiful as possible. White is suitable, and there are\\r\\nso many fabrics in that color that all purses can be accommodated. The\\r\\ngown may be of satin, crepe de chine, messaline, lace or chiffon, or of\\r\\nsimple white organdie; all are appropriate for a church wedding. With any\\r\\nof these a veil should be worn. Two and a half yards of tulle will be\\r\\nsufficient; other accessories are white kid gloves, white slippers and\\r\\nwhite silk hose, if white is worn. White is suitable for the most\\r\\nelaborate church wedding and for the simplest ceremony at home. The gown\\r\\nis made en train, as a rule; always so for a church wedding, and always\\r\\nwith high neck and long sleeves.\\r\\n\\r\\nA bride may elect to be married in a traveling dress. For this some pretty\\r\\nlight color, as light gray, champagne, tan or biscuit color is chosen. A\\r\\nhat must be worn with such a costume, and for a young bride is by\\r\\npreference trimmed with flowers. It is correct to carry flowers--not a\\r\\nshower bouquet, however--with such a gown, which is to be changed for a\\r\\nplainer one for actual travel. For this dark blue, brown, or gray are\\r\\nsuitable colors; gloves match, and the hat is inconspicuously trimmed. It\\r\\nis the bride\\'s greatest desire not to look \"just married.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLater Wear of the Wedding Gown.--The wedding gown is worn at the more\\r\\nformal of the post-nuptial entertainments. The trousseau should include an\\r\\nevening dress and wrap. For the former, black lace, chiffon cloth or net\\r\\nwill prove the most serviceable, and almost universally becoming. A\\r\\ntraveling gown, a handsome suit for visiting, receptions, etc., a pretty\\r\\ngown for receiving at home, and several house gowns will be needed.\\r\\nKimonas, bath-robes, dressing-jackets, are included in the less ornamental\\r\\nparts of the trousseau.\\r\\n\\r\\nA girl often invites her intimate friends to inspect her wedding finery,\\r\\nrejoicing in their admiration. The privilege of such a view is highly\\r\\nvalued.\\r\\n\\r\\n[736 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nBridal Flowers.--Orange flowers are reserved for the bride, and she never\\r\\nwears any other in her hair, at least no other that are artificial. She\\r\\nmay carry any flowers, she prefers; the florists make all seasons alike.\\r\\nOften an order is given months in advance for the bride\\'s favorite flower\\r\\nto grace her wedding, and the florist forces it to bloom at the appointed\\r\\ntime. White roses and carnations can be had at almost any season; sweet\\r\\npeas, white lilacs, lilies of the valley, are less easy to procure. The\\r\\n\"shower bouquet\" has many narrow white satin ribbons falling from it to\\r\\nthe foot of the skirt, and knotted at intervals round flower sprays.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rarest of bridal flowers are the orchids, so costly that only the rich\\r\\nmay have them, though a few orchids, two or three, are sometimes put with\\r\\nlilies of the valley, or Roman hyacinths, intermixed with stephanotis or\\r\\nstevia, for the bridal bouquet. Bridesmaids may carry large clusters of\\r\\nflowers tied with ribbons, the flowers suiting their costumes. Or, if they\\r\\nall wear white, American Beauties may be chosen. The usual preference is\\r\\nfor flowers in more delicate hues.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Widow\\'s Bridal Attire.--A widow does not wear white at her second\\r\\nwedding, nor a veil, nor does she have bridesmaids. Her usual choice is to\\r\\nbe married in a handsome traveling gown of some light color, wearing hat\\r\\nand gloves to match. The material may be silk or broadcloth for a church\\r\\nwedding. She wears her wedding ring up to the day of her second marriage.\\r\\nThough she may have no bridesmaids she may have a matron-of-honor, some\\r\\nmarried friend, who wears a street or reception dress, with suitable hat\\r\\nand gloves.\\r\\n\\r\\nA woman who has entered her fourth decade does not, as a rule, wear white\\r\\nwhen married.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is no longer customary for a woman to go into semi-retirement preceding\\r\\nher marriage. She does not parade herself; no lady would do that, but she\\r\\naccepts invitations and appears at all the fetes planned for her up to the\\r\\nwedding day. As a result, she is often very tired and fagged before the\\r\\nevent.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Man\\'s Wedding Garments.--One of the most frequent inquiries made of\\r\\nthe editors of women\\'s departments in magazines relates to the proper\\r\\nattire for the bridegroom. \"When is it correct to wear a dress suit?\" and\\r\\n\"What should the bridegroom wear at a day wedding?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The dress suit,\" so called, is the man\\'s evening clothes. Naturally,\\r\\nthen, he will not don his evening attire until evening--after or for a six\\r\\no\\'clock dinner,\\' This should dispose of the question of \"the dress suit.\"\\r\\nFor a man to wear evening clothes at a noon wedding would be as absurd as\\r\\nfor a woman to appear in a ball dress at that hour.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a day wedding a man wears a black frock coat and gray trousers; his\\r\\nwaistcoat may match the coat or be of white duck or marseilles, white\\r\\nshirt with standing collar, and tie of the fashionable cut in pearl gray\\r\\nor soft white silk. Pearl-colored kid gloves are worn, and a silk hat. The\\r\\novercoat is black. A boutonniere of white flowers is usually worn.\\r\\n\\r\\n[MANNERS AND SOCIAL CUSTOMS 737]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe above is the correct dress for best man and ushers at a day wedding,\\r\\nin church or at home.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a formal evening wedding, full evening dress is worn by bridegroom,\\r\\nbest man and ushers. The suit is of fine black worsted, silk faced as to\\r\\nthe coat. The waistcoat may be of the same material, or white duck or\\r\\nmarseilles may be worn. A fine white linen shirt with standing collar, and\\r\\npearl or white enamel studs, white lawn tie, white or pearl-gray kid\\r\\ngloves stitched in the same color, and patent leather pumps complete the\\r\\nattire. A black overcoat, single breasted, and silk hat are the additions\\r\\nfor out-of-door wear.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bride\\'s Mother.--The bride\\'s mother wears a handsome reception dress.\\r\\nBlack with much jet and lace, pearl gray, mauve and lavender are favorite\\r\\ncolors for her. White gloves are worn. Mourning attire should never be\\r\\nseen at a wedding. If the bride\\'s mother, or any of the family, are in\\r\\nmourning, it must be laid aside for the occasion. Black may be worn, but\\r\\nit must be lightened with white lace, jet, or other accessories that will\\r\\ntake it out of the conventional garb of grief. Guests of course gown\\r\\nthemselves handsomely.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE FORMAL CHURCH WEDDING.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet us suppose that the church has been decorated with flower and palms,\\r\\narranged by experienced hands to form a background for the bridal party.\\r\\nThe seats for the respective families have been roped off with wide white\\r\\nsatin ribbons; those on the right for the bridegroom\\'s family, those of\\r\\nthe left for the bride\\'s. The bridegroom and the best man are with the\\r\\nclergyman in the vestry; the bridesmaids have assembled at the bride\\'s\\r\\nhouse, and have entered their carriages; the relatives, including the\\r\\nbride\\'s mother, and guests are in their seats. The carriages containing\\r\\nthe bridesmaids precede that of the bride to the church; they alight and\\r\\nawait her in the vestibule. The bride, accompanied by her father, arrives.\\r\\nThe bridal procession is quickly formed, the vestibule doors having been\\r\\nclosed by the ushers on the arrival of the wedding party. At the signal\\r\\nthe organ breaks into the familiar strains of the wedding march; the\\r\\nclergyman, followed by the groom and best man, enter from the vestry, and\\r\\nstand on the chancel step facing the guests, awaiting the bride, the\\r\\nbridegroom being slightly, in advance.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ushers, walking two and two, lead the way up the aisle; the\\r\\nbridesmaids follow at a distance of ten or twelve feet, also walking in\\r\\npairs; then comes the maid-of-honor, walking alone. She is followed by the\\r\\nbride, leaning on the arm of her father or nearest male relative. At the\\r\\nchancel the ushers separate to right and left, remaining below the chancel\\r\\nstep; the bridesmaids separate in the same manner, but ascend the chancel\\r\\nstep. The maid-of-honor places herself at the left of the place left for\\r\\nthe bride, in readiness to hold her bouquet and remove her glove. The\\r\\nbridegroom descends the chancel step, meeting the bride. The two place\\r\\nthemselves before the clergyman, the bride standing on the bridegroom\\'s\\r\\nleft; the best man stands at the right of the bridegroom a step or two in\\r\\nthe rear.\\r\\n\\r\\n[738 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bride\\'s Father.--The place of the bride\\'s father is at the left\\r\\nsomewhat in the rear. As the clergyman asks: \"Who giveth this woman to be\\r\\nmarried to this man?\" he steps forward and places the bride\\'s right hand\\r\\nin that of the clergyman, who in turn places it in that of the bridegroom.\\r\\nThe father steps aside, and as the bridal procession forms to retire after\\r\\nthe ceremony, he joins his wife and escorts her from the church.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the proper moment the maid-of-honor removes the bride\\'s glove and takes\\r\\nher bouquet. The best man gives the ring to the bride, who passes it to\\r\\nthe clergyman; the latter gives it to the bridegroom, who places it on the\\r\\nbride\\'s finger, holding it there while repeating the formula, \"With this\\r\\nring I thee wed,\" etc. The significance of this transfer is the forming of\\r\\na circle, to indicate the endlessness of the contract.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother Form.--A form sometimes introduced is for the bridal party to\\r\\nstand below the chancel while the clergyman reads the service up to and\\r\\nincluding the sentence, \"If any man can show just cause,\" etc. After the\\r\\ncustomary moment\\'s pause, there being no unseemly interruption, the party\\r\\nascends the chancel step and the ceremony proceeds.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe order of the procession after the ceremony is this: The just married\\r\\npair lead the way, the wife taking her husband\\'s arm; the maid-of-honor\\r\\nfollows; then the bridesmaids, after them the ushers. Such is the conduct\\r\\nof a church wedding, a thousand times repeated. The ceremony is often\\r\\nrehearsed a night or two previous to the event, to make sure each will be\\r\\nfamiliar with his or her part.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Best Man\\'s Duties.--The best man has charge of the ring. At the\\r\\nconclusion of the ceremony he disappears into the vestry, where he places\\r\\nthe wedding fee, enclosed in an envelope, in the clergyman\\'s hands. He\\r\\nthen hastens to his carriage and is driven to the house, where he assists\\r\\nin the reception of the guests, and takes the maid-of-honor or the\\r\\nbridesmaid to luncheon. Or he may escort the maid-of-honor from the\\r\\nchurch.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe best man also sees to it that the agitated bridegroom\\'s clothes are in\\r\\norder, packs his suitcase, orders the baggage to be called for, buys the\\r\\ntickets for the wedding journey and sees that they are in the bridegroom\\'s\\r\\npossession, and orders the carriage in which the newly wedded pair drive\\r\\nto the station. He takes as many of the details of the affair as possible\\r\\noff his friend\\'s mind and hands, and stands by manfully to the last. The\\r\\nbest man should fully acquaint himself with the duties of his position\\r\\nbefore assuming it The sexton of the church takes the groom\\'s hat from the\\r\\nvestry to the vestibule, and hands it to him at the door.\\r\\n\\r\\n[MANNERS AND SOCIAL CUSTOMS 739]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuties of Ushers.--An usher escorts each lady to her seat, giving her his\\r\\narm. The guests should stand during the ceremony, rising as the procession\\r\\nenters, and remaining in their seats until it has retired. The ushers\\r\\noften pass ribbons along their seats, not removing them until the bridal\\r\\nparty and the relatives have left the church. Having seen the bridal party\\r\\nto their carriages, the ushers return to escort the relatives to theirs,\\r\\nand then hasten to the house, where they meet the guests on arrival and\\r\\nescort them, severally, to the receiving party. The bride\\'s mother\\r\\nwelcomes them first; they are then presented to the newly married pair.\\r\\nThe bride offers her hand; the guest wishes her much happiness,\\r\\ncongratulates the bridegroom, shaking hands the while, greets the\\r\\nmaid-of-honor and the bridesmaids with a smile and bow, and passes on,\\r\\nmaking way for the next.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Wedding Reception.--The wedding reception follows the ceremony, guests\\r\\ncoming at once from church to the house. There should be no undue haste in\\r\\npresenting one\\'s self; the party requires a little time to arrange itself\\r\\nin proper order for receiving. At a day wedding reception women lay aside\\r\\nwraps, retaining their hats. At an evening reception they remove both, and\\r\\nwear full dress.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter greeting the bride and groom, as indicated in the preceding\\r\\nparagraph, the refreshment room is sought. If the reception is a large\\r\\none, a buffet or \"stand-up\" repast is often served, though it is more\\r\\ndesirable to provide small tables seating four people. If these are not\\r\\nfurnished the men may assist the ladies, though the service should be\\r\\nadequate. No tea, coffee, or chocolate is poured at the table.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRefreshments.--The refreshments may be simple or elaborate. The table is\\r\\nlaid in the dining-room, and decorated with flowers. On it are the\\r\\nrefreshments, and plenty of napkins, plates and silver, in piles.\\r\\nBouillon, creamed oysters or oyster patties; salads, cold salmon or\\r\\nlobster with mayonnaise dressing, ices and cake are suitable. Usually one\\r\\nhot dish is passed. Or one may serve a salad, ice cream and cake, with\\r\\npunch. If wine is offered it is always champagne.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wedding cake, neatly packed in white boxes bearing the monogram of the\\r\\nbride and groom and tied with white satin ribbon, is arranged on a table\\r\\nin the hall, and each departing guest takes a box. Wedding cake is no\\r\\nlonger sent.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGoing Away.--When the last guest has been greeted, the bridal party may be\\r\\nserved with refreshments. Their supper is laid in a private room, and they\\r\\nare seated, a most welcome rest after the fatigue of the ceremony and the\\r\\nreception. The bride then retires to change to her traveling dress; the\\r\\nbridegroom, who has had his valise sent to the house in the morning,\\r\\nretires for the same purpose. The maid-of-honor accompanies the bride; the\\r\\nbest man assists the groom, and packs his suit worn during the ceremony,\\r\\neither to be taken with him or to be sent to his home.\\r\\n\\r\\n[740 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the time agreed upon the bridegroom awaits the bride at the head of the\\r\\nstairs. Adieus to the family are said in the bride\\'s room and should be\\r\\nbrief. The bridesmaids and ushers are awaiting the departure in the hall.\\r\\nHalf way down the stairs the bride throws her bouquet. The bridesmaid who\\r\\ncatches it will be married next, according to the old superstition. The\\r\\nbride and groom enter their carriage amid a shower of rice or confetti,\\r\\nthe carriage door bangs; the caterer has removed the debris of the feast;\\r\\nthe maids have restored the house to its wonted order and the wedding is\\r\\nover--all except paying the bills.\\r\\n\\r\\nGuests at a wedding do not remain until the departure of the bride. They\\r\\ncongratulate, partake of refreshments, chat a few minutes with friends,\\r\\nand depart.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt a church wedding it is customary--and usually necessary to keep out the\\r\\nuninvited--to enclose small cards which are presented at the church door\\r\\nto ensure admittance. If the reception is large, the same thing is\\r\\nsometimes done as a measure of protection.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCalls after Wedding.--It is expected that the guests at a wedding\\r\\nbreakfast or reception will call on the mother of the bride within three\\r\\nweeks after the marriage, and upon the bride on one of her \"At Home\" days,\\r\\nor soon after her return from the wedding journey, if no days are\\r\\nspecified.\\r\\n\\r\\nCards bearing the date of the bride\\'s \"At Home\" days, or \"At Home\\r\\nafter\"--a certain date, are enclosed with the announcement cards, or the\\r\\ndate named on the card. If sent they must be ready to mail immediately\\r\\nafter the wedding.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE HOME WEDDING.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the home wedding is modeled in its essentials along the lines of the\\r\\nchurch wedding, much less formality is observed. The invitations to the\\r\\nchurch wedding are always in the third person and engraved. Those for the\\r\\nhome wedding, though often following the same formula, may be informal\\r\\nnotes in the first person, written by the bride\\'s mother.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCorrect Attire.--It is sometimes supposed that a bride married at home may\\r\\nnot wear a veil nor be \"given away.\" On the contrary, if she wears white\\r\\nshe may with perfect propriety wear a veil, and the Episcopal marriage\\r\\nceremony always, and nearly all other forms of the service include the\\r\\ngiving away, as implying parental sanction and consent. The \"giving away,\"\\r\\nthen, is customary, even at the simplest home wedding.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the bride wears a traveling dress she has a maid-of-honor, the one\\r\\nattendant being so-called. The groom is attended by his best man. There\\r\\nare usually two ushers, though these may be omitted, The maid-of-honor\\r\\nwears some pretty costume which is in keeping with that of the bride. If\\r\\nthe latter wears white, the attendant also wears white with colored\\r\\ntrimmings. If the bride wears a veil, the maid wears a hat; the veil being\\r\\nthe head covering of the bride.\\r\\n\\r\\n[MANNERS AND SOCIAL CUSTOMS 741]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bridegroom wears a black frock coat, gray trousers, white waistcoat\\r\\nand tie, silk--not lawn, gray or white gloves, and patent leather shoes at\\r\\na day wedding, The ushers are similarly attired, save that they may wear\\r\\nblack waistcoats. Silk hats are worn.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMinor Particulars.--The bridegroom and best man will require a room. The\\r\\nclergyman expects a room where he may don his surplice or gown. The ushers\\r\\nmay also require a room.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bride\\'s mother receives the guests, her father remaining with his\\r\\ndaughter to conduct her to the room where the ceremony is to be performed.\\r\\nA mother may perform this office if the father is not living. After\\r\\nplacing his daughter\\'s hand in that of the clergyman, the father steps\\r\\nback a pace or two, awaiting the end of the service. Wedding music is\\r\\nplayed when the party is ready to enter, and may be continued, very\\r\\nsoftly, through the ceremony; it must not overpower the voices of the\\r\\nparticipants.\\r\\n\\r\\nGuests should arrive at the hour named, leave wraps in hall or dressing\\r\\nroom, and descend to the parlors. It is not expected that all will be\\r\\nseated, though a few chairs are provided for the elderly. The ushers\\r\\nstretch two lengths of white ribbon from end to end of the room, making an\\r\\naisle for the little procession.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe clergyman, groom, and best man enter and take their places at one end\\r\\nof the room, when the music begins. Then come the ushers, next the\\r\\nmaid-of-honor, walking alone; then the bridesmaids, if any, followed by\\r\\nthe bride on the arm of her father. The groom steps forward to receive her\\r\\nand the two face the clergyman. The best man stands on the bridegroom\\'s\\r\\nright. The maid-of-honor will hold the bride\\'s bouquet and her glove, if\\r\\nthis is removed; the ring is in the custody of the best man.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEtiquette to be Observed.--At the close of the ceremony the clergyman\\r\\ncongratulates the pair and steps aside. They face about and the bride\\'s\\r\\nmother is the next to offer her good wishes, then the groom\\'s parents. The\\r\\nguests then extend felicitations. It is thought in better taste to wish\\r\\nthe bride happiness and congratulate the groom, it being supposed that he\\r\\nis the most fortunate in having been able to secure such a prize.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is no longer customary for everyone to kiss the bride; she is not\\r\\ncompelled to suffer to that extent.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe best man assists the ushers--whose first duty is to remove the white\\r\\nribbons--in escorting guests to the bride and groom. His duties are the\\r\\nsame as those of the best man at a church wedding.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe maid-of-honor stands at the bride\\'s left as she receives.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bride and bridegroom lead the way to the dining room, the best man\\r\\noffering his arm to the maid-of-honor.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bride\\'s father escorts the bridegroom\\'s mother, the guests follow in\\r\\nsuch order as is convenient, and the bride\\'s mother and the bridegroom\\'s\\r\\nfather are the last.\\r\\n\\r\\n[742 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nIf only twenty-five or thirty guests are present the wedding breakfast is\\r\\npreferably served at small tables. The clergyman and his wife, who should\\r\\nalways be invited, are seated at the bride\\'s table. So also the\\r\\nmaid-of-honor, the best man, the ushers, and the parents of the pair, with\\r\\nsisters and brothers if convenient. Or, the bride\\'s table may be reserved\\r\\nstrictly for the bridal party.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bride may cut her own cake if she chooses, or the wedding cake may be\\r\\ndispensed in boxes as at the reception following a church wedding.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe departure of the newly wedded pair is on the order already indicated.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the Wedding.--It may be said here that the \"horse play\"--for it is\\r\\nnothing else--sometimes indulged in as \"an after clap\" to a wedding, in\\r\\nwhich practical jokes are played on the pair, is not only unkind and\\r\\nill-bred, but in most execrable taste. To placard the luggage \"Just\\r\\nmarried;\" to tie white ribbons on it and the carriage in which they are\\r\\ndriven away; to substitute a suitcase packed with the things a man doesn\\'t\\r\\nwant on his journey for one containing what he does, is not at all\\r\\n\"smart.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy should some coarse, ill-bred persons, whether they have or have not\\r\\nbeen favored with invitations, strive to embarrass and make uncomfortable\\r\\nthose to whom the situation is already sufficiently trying? Why, after so\\r\\nmuch pains and expense have been employed to make the occasion beautiful\\r\\nand impressive, should the \"practical joker\" take it upon himself to spoil\\r\\nit all by an ill-timed \"pleasantry\" which is the acme of rudeness and\\r\\ndiscourtesy? It is a curious character that can enjoy perpetrating what\\r\\nare really outrages upon other people\\'s sensibilities.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWedding Gifts.--Very soon after the wedding invitations are out the\\r\\npresents begin to pour in. The fashion of gift giving on such an occasion\\r\\nis not as prevalent as at one time; it was overdone, carried beyond the\\r\\nlimits of good taste, and of course a reaction was inevitable. Some men\\r\\nprofess to share the feeling of the Scandinavian immigrant who was so\\r\\ndeeply affronted at the offerings made by his bride\\'s friends--as if he\\r\\nwere not able to furnish his home with the necessary articles--that in his\\r\\nBerserker rage he was with difficulty restrained from casting gifts and\\r\\ndonors together into the street.\\r\\n\\r\\nGenerally speaking, only relatives and intimate friends send gifts, though\\r\\nthere is no interdict as regards others who may wish to testify to their\\r\\ninterest in the bride in this way. An ostentatious gift from a person not\\r\\nin the family is in bad taste. The words \"No presents\" on wedding\\r\\ninvitations are in the worst possible form.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn invitation to a church wedding and not to the reception precludes the\\r\\nnecessity of making a gift; indeed, it would be thought rather \"pushing\"\\r\\nto send one.\\r\\n\\r\\n[MANNERS AND SOCIAL CUSTOMS 743]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat to Give.--The flat silver is generally given by the bride\\'s family.\\r\\nIn order to avoid duplicates, it is best for the friends and  relatives to\\r\\nconsult together in regard to their gifts. It is not thought good form to\\r\\noffer articles of wearing apparel. Anything the bride\\'s immediate family\\r\\nhas to offer in this line is best included in the trousseau. Cut glass,\\r\\nsilver, bric-a-brac, napery, books, pictures, fans, rugs, clocks, handsome\\r\\nchairs and tables, are things that may be chosen with propriety.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe question of the correct form of marking silver and napery often comes\\r\\nup. The rule is to have it engraved with the initials of the bride\\'s\\r\\nmaiden name--not the single initial of her family name, as is sometimes\\r\\nignorantly done--because it is her own private property. If a wife dies,\\r\\nthe silver bearing her name is packed away for the future use of her\\r\\nchild, especially if it is a girl. The second wife would be forbidden by\\r\\ngood taste and convention, from using the first wife\\'s silver.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAcknowledgments.--Wedding gifts are usually packed where they are bought,\\r\\nand sent direct from the shops. The card of the donor is enclosed, within\\r\\na tiny envelope. It is a rule that the wedding gift must be acknowledged\\r\\nimmediately, before the marriage, and by a personal note from the bride.\\r\\nThis is not always possible, but the note should be written at the\\r\\nearliest moment the bride\\'s engagements will permit. Such notes are always\\r\\nin the first person, and should be pleasant and cordial. The writer must\\r\\nbe careful to render thanks for the article sent. Amusing mistakes\\r\\nsometimes happen; thus a lady who had sent a pair of handsome candlesticks\\r\\nwas mystified by expressions of gratitude for a silver berry spoon she had\\r\\nnot sent.\\r\\n\\r\\nA cordial form of acknowledging a gift is this:\\r\\n\\r\\n                                     12 Canton Avenue.\\r\\n    My Dear Mrs. Bruce:\\r\\n       The beautiful cut glass vase sent by you and Mr. Bruce has just\\r\\n    arrived, and I hasten to thank you most sincerely for your kind\\r\\n    thought of me. It will be a constant reminder of your goodness to Mr.\\r\\n    Waters and myself, and a most lovely ornament to our new home.\\r\\n                               Gratefully yours,\\r\\n                                                Marion Moore.\\r\\n       July tenth, nineteen hundred and nine.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wedding gifts may or may not be displayed, according to the personal\\r\\npreference of the bride. They are commonly shown to intimate friends. A\\r\\nroom is given up to their display. Cards are to be removed.\\r\\n\\r\\n[744 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nWedding Decorations.--At a church wedding it is customary, and wisest, to\\r\\nput the matter of decorating the church and house into the hands of a\\r\\nflorist, who can furnish the palms and others plants required for the\\r\\nchancel, and carry out any color scheme desired. He has the paraphernalia\\r\\nrequisite to effective disposition of flowers. Usually large clusters of\\r\\nfoliage and flowers, ribbon tied, are attached to the pews reserved for\\r\\nthe relatives; often they are arranged the entire length of the aisle, The\\r\\nmantels in the house are banked with flowers, southern smilax is used in\\r\\nprofusion, and flowers are arranged upon the tables at which the supper is\\r\\nserved.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt a church wedding in the country the bride\\'s friends must come to the\\r\\nrescue, and their gardens be robbed to beautify church and home. Flowers\\r\\nmay be sought in the fields. Large jars of daisies, wild ferns, tall\\r\\ngrasses, autumn tinted boughs, or in the blooming season, boughs of fruit\\r\\ntrees, can be used most effectively. At one pretty home wedding the\\r\\ndecorations were boughs of the wild crab-apple in bloom, pink and pretty,\\r\\nand kept so by having the stems inserted in bottles of water, suspended by\\r\\nwires and concealed by other foliage. A large screen sometimes forms a\\r\\nbackground for the bridal party. If covered with wire netting flowers can\\r\\nbe very easily attached.\\r\\n\\r\\nWalls are not festooned; \"wedding bells\" and canopies are out of date. The\\r\\nmost approved setting is tall palms, ferns on standards concealed by a\\r\\nlower grouping, with a few potted plants in bloom to relieve the\\r\\nsombreness of the green. Large flowers like lilies, hydrangeas,\\r\\nchrysanthemums and peonies are most effective. Tulips are often employed\\r\\nat a spring wedding. One little country girl made good use of ordinary\\r\\nfield clover in decorating her home for her marriage.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a wedding, the flowers are often sent to the hospitals, or to those\\r\\nwho are known to be ill, at the request of the bride.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE SIMPLEST OF WEDDINGS.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, although we have told how the church wedding and the ordinary home\\r\\nwedding are conducted, it does not follow that one may not have a much\\r\\nsimpler and yet a pretty wedding, with less \"pomp and circumstance\" and\\r\\nconsequent expense.\\r\\n\\r\\nWherever a girl has a home, she should be married from it. This is her\\r\\ndue, as \"daughter of the house.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe may make the simplest possible preparations; may be married in her\\r\\nbest dress, not new for the occasion. She may omit all attendants, and\\r\\ninvite less than half a dozen of her friends; she may receive them herself\\r\\nand at the appointed hour simply stand up and be married to a blushing\\r\\nyoung man in a business suit, and afterwards cut her own cake, and then\\r\\nproceed to her new home, which may be a little flat or a cottage. But she\\r\\nshould have the ceremony performed by a clergyman in her father\\'s house.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf she has no parents, no home, merely a room in a boarding house, she and\\r\\nher affianced may go to a clergyman\\'s house and be married there. The\\r\\nchurch and the law should sanction the rite; therefore she will not permit\\r\\nherself to be married by a magistrate or a justice of the peace.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for \"sneaking off\" and being married without the knowledge of one\\'s\\r\\nparents, this is both disrespectful and unkind--a poor return for their\\r\\ncare of her.\\r\\n\\r\\n[MANNERS AND SOCIAL CUSTOMS 745]\\r\\n\\r\\nWEDDING ANNIVERSARIES.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fashion of celebrating a succession of wedding anniversaries has\\r\\npassed its high tide and is on the wane. Nevertheless, the custom is not\\r\\nout, by any means. The tenth, twenty-fifth and fiftieth anniversaries,\\r\\nknown as the tin, silver, and golden, are those most frequently observed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first anniversary of the wedding day gives occasion for a paper\\r\\nwedding; the second is cotton; the third leather. The fourth is omitted;\\r\\nthe fifth is the wooden wedding; next to be observed is the tin,\\r\\ncelebrating the close of the first decade. The next skip is to the china,\\r\\nwhen twenty years have elapsed; and the quarter century of wedded\\r\\nhappiness is recognized in the silver wedding.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wooden and tin weddings are occasions of great hilarity, and mean a\\r\\ngeneral frolic. The former began years ago with the gift of a rolling-pin\\r\\nand a step-ladder. The gifts are of those practical, useful articles that\\r\\nreplenish the kitchen, though handsome gifts are of course easily\\r\\nselected. Carved wooden boxes, handsome picture frames, articles of\\r\\nfurniture, are at the service of those who choose to pay their price.\\r\\n\\r\\nInvitations to a wooden wedding are sometimes written or printed on birch\\r\\nbark or thin strips of wood, or are engraved on cards which imitate wood\\r\\nin appearance. The refreshments have been served on wooden plates procured\\r\\nfrom the grocer. So far as possible the wooden idea is carried out.\\r\\n\\r\\nTin Weddings.--Gifts for the tin wedding are of course in that material,\\r\\nand there is a wide range of choice. The tinsmith is often called upon to\\r\\nmanufacture fantastic articles, anything to raise a laugh. Thus one couple\\r\\nwere adorned, the wife with a set of tin curls, the man with a tin hat. A\\r\\ntin purse enclosing a check for \"tin\" was once presented to a tin bride on\\r\\nthe occasion of her tin wedding. The freakish fancy of one\\'s friends is\\r\\ngenerally much in evidence at a tin wedding. As at the wooden wedding, the\\r\\nbride cuts a wedding cake decorated with a monogram formed of the initials\\r\\nof her own and her husband\\'s name, and the year of the wedding and of its\\r\\nanniversary. Refreshments may be served from tin dishes, and the guests\\r\\nprovided with tin plates.\\r\\n\\r\\n[746 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Silver Wedding.--Cards for a silver wedding are printed in silver, or\\r\\nin black on silvered cards--the former being in better taste. The\\r\\nform--which may be used for all with the variation of but one word--that\\r\\ndesignating the nature of the anniversary, is as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n     1885          Mr. and Mrs. Smith             1910\\r\\n          request the pleasure of your company on\\r\\n            Thursday, February the twenty-fourth,\\r\\n                    at eight o\\'clock.\\r\\n                     Silver Wedding.\\r\\n     George Smith                            Anna Hall\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the couple who celebrate are generally in the prime of life, and their\\r\\nfriends of about the same age, a silver wedding is usually a very\\r\\nenjoyable function. The many beautiful articles now made in silver afford\\r\\na wide range of choice in the way of gifts, both valuable and in those\\r\\ninexpensive trifles that please everybody because so artistic. Silverware\\r\\nis marked with the initials of the married pair, often enclosed in a true\\r\\nlover\\'s knot. Toilet articles, pomade jars, silver jewelry, spoons, silver\\r\\nparasol and umbrella handles, picture frames in silver, rings and\\r\\nbracelets, besides the manifold pieces for table use, offer a wide\\r\\nindividual range in choice and price.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe supper at a silver wedding is quite elaborate. The bride that was cuts\\r\\na wedding cake in which a silver piece is baked; the person who gets it\\r\\nbeing expected to live to celebrate his or her silver wedding. Speeches\\r\\nare made, often an original poem read, and not infrequently the health of\\r\\nthe pair pledged in a glass of wine.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGolden Weddings--Occasions for the celebration of fifty years of union are\\r\\nmuch rarer than any other. Nor are they wholly joyful. The aged couple are\\r\\nlooking from \"life\\'s west windows\" at a fast declining sun. A few short\\r\\nyears and it must set for them. The festivities are usually planned and\\r\\ncarried out by their descendants, who so far as possible summon to the\\r\\ncelebration the friends of \"Auld lang syne,\" the clergyman who performed\\r\\nthe ceremony and any of the bridal party yet alive, and the dearest\\r\\nfriends of the present. Invitations in the conventional form are printed\\r\\nin gold letters; often a monogram formed of intertwined initials is placed\\r\\nbetween and a little above the years at the top of the invitation. The\\r\\nwedding cake has a yellow frosting, or if in white, the monogram and the\\r\\nyears--1860-1910--are in yellow to represent gold.\\r\\n\\r\\nGifts in this precious metal are naturally circumscribed, but a gold coin\\r\\nis apropos, particularly if Fortune has been chary of her favors. In the\\r\\nseventh and eighth decade people have small use for bijouterie.\\r\\n\\r\\nA golden wedding must be a sad anniversary to the participants. When they\\r\\nwere wedded, they were looking forward, joyously; now they recall the\\r\\npast, its losses and trials and misfortunes. They remember the children\\r\\nwho are dead, or far away; or the prosperity once theirs, but now fled.\\r\\nFew old folks would care to celebrate their golden wedding; it is usually\\r\\nsome well-meaning grandchild who sees in it \"an occasion.\" Often, too, the\\r\\nexcitement, the fatigue, the unusual strain on mind and body, result in\\r\\nillness which sometimes proves fatal.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Courtesies of the Occasion.--There is no formal etiquette for any of\\r\\nthese anniversaries. Friends, as they arrive, are greeted by members of\\r\\nthe family; then, in the case of the elderly celebrants, are conducted to\\r\\nthem as they sit side by side, and presented. Failing eyesight and dulled\\r\\nears demand this. The congratulations are offered, and good wishes for the\\r\\nfuture. If any speeches are made, they should be brief, that neither the\\r\\nold couple or their guests be over-fatigued. The stay should be brief.\\r\\n\\r\\n[MANNERS AND SOCIAL CUSTOMS 747]\\r\\n\\r\\nGifts.--Gifts for the anniversary wedding are sometimes sent the day\\r\\nprevious, sometimes carried in person. Anything fantastic is generally\\r\\npresented at the gathering, to contribute to its hilarity. The silver\\r\\nwedding gifts are nearly always sent in advance, and are displayed on a\\r\\ntable, the cards of the donor usually being left on them. The recipients\\r\\nare to tender their thanks in person or by note.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery effort should be made to have these festivities joyous. Especially\\r\\nshould the wife subdue her emotion if the review of the years since her\\r\\nbona fide wedding day have seen the loss of beloved children. She must\\r\\nstifle her sad recollections for the sake of her guests.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe members of the bridal party, the more honored guests at the first\\r\\nwedding, the clergyman who officiated, are sought as welcome guests at the\\r\\nanniversary. The bride that was wears something she wore on the first\\r\\noccasion. If the wedding dress and the bridegroom\\'s suit have been\\r\\npreserved they are worn--and wonderfully quaint they often look, so great\\r\\nthe change in fashion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHRISTENING CEREMONIES.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Our birth is nothing but our death begun,\\r\\n as tapers waste the moment they take fire.\"\\r\\n                                 --Young.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe arrival of the stork with the new baby is an event of vast family\\r\\ninterest, especially if it is the first visit of the bird to the domicile.\\r\\nIn America it is not customary to announce a birth in the newspapers, as\\r\\nis often done in England, especially among the nobility. The personal\\r\\nfriends of the parents receive the visiting card of both, or of the mother\\r\\nonly, to which is attached a small card bearing the baby\\'s full name and\\r\\nthe date of his arrival. These are enclosed in an envelope, this again in\\r\\nan outer one, and mailed.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is proper for those thus notified to call at an early date to inquire\\r\\nas to the well-being of mother and babe. As it is not customary for the\\r\\nmother to receive any but a very few of her nearest relatives under at\\r\\nleast three weeks, callers should not be expected to see her, but are to\\r\\nleave cards. A note of congratulation is often sent instead of calling,\\r\\nand offers to the ingenious and witty an excellent chance for the display\\r\\nof delicate pleasantry. Thus it is entirely proper to address the note to\\r\\nthe baby, and congratulate him on having chosen such charming parents, and\\r\\nsuch a lovely home. Flowers are not infrequently sent to the mother, and\\r\\nlittle gifts--soft booties, little gold pins for sleeve and neck, little\\r\\ncrocheted or knitted sacks, or dainty bibs--to the baby.\\r\\n\\r\\n[748 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Ceremony.--The baby is usually christened when it is six or eight\\r\\nweeks old. Clergymen prefer this should be done at the church, and\\r\\ngenerally arrange to perform several baptisms at the same time--Children\\'s\\r\\nDay being a favorite time. Otherwise, the christening usually takes place\\r\\nafter the congregation is dismissed at the conclusion of a service. Only\\r\\nthose interested and a few specially invited friends remain for it. There\\r\\nis no objection, however, to having a child christened at home, when the\\r\\naffair is made one of more festivity.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost young married people prefer to have the clergyman who married them\\r\\nchristen their first baby, when practicable.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSponsors.--The baby\\'s sponsors are chosen, by the parents\\' agreement, from\\r\\namong their relatives and close friends, almost always those of their own\\r\\ncommunion. The request is preferred verbally or by personal notes. A boy\\r\\nhas a godmother and two godfathers; a girl two godmothers and a godfather.\\r\\nOccasionally this rule is broken and a godmother alone chosen for a girl,\\r\\nand one godfather for a boy. Godparents are supposed to stand in a more\\r\\nintimate relation to their godchildren than to others, and to take a more\\r\\npersonal interest in them, especially in case of the parents\\' death. It is\\r\\na serious relation, involving a certain religious responsibility, and is\\r\\nnot to be lightly entered into.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe godparents are expected to make christening gifts to the child on his\\r\\nbaptismal day. They are usually in the form of silver cups, porringers,\\r\\nsilver spoons, forks, etc.; these should be solid, never plated ware. If\\r\\nthe babe is named for one of its godparents, the latter is expected to do\\r\\nsomething handsome in the way of a christening gift. Sometimes a bank\\r\\naccount is opened in the child\\'s name, the sum deposited being left at\\r\\ninterest until he becomes of age.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChurch Christenings.--At a church christening, the babe is dressed in its\\r\\nhandsomest robe and cap. Formerly the robes were very long and miracles of\\r\\nlace and embroidery; at present the finest of linen lawn or batiste, with\\r\\na little real lace at neck and sleeves, and a bit of fine French\\r\\nembroidery, is thought in better taste, even in the case of the very\\r\\nwealthy. And many a blessed baby is given his name in a simple little lawn\\r\\nrobe with no embellishment beyond a little tucking--done by the mother\\'s\\r\\nown hands, perhaps.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe nurse carries the child into the church. Sponsors and parents group\\r\\nthemselves around the font, which is often decorated with white flowers.\\r\\nThe godmother has the privilege of holding the babe until it is time to\\r\\nlay him in the clergyman\\'s arms, the cap having been removed. The parents\\r\\nmake the responses; after the naming the godmother takes the little one\\r\\nagain, holding him until the close of the service. She should not wipe\\r\\naway any of the water placed on the child\\'s head. A good baby is expected\\r\\nnot to cry during the ceremony, and one advantage of an early christening\\r\\nis that the little fellow is less liable to be alarmed at strange\\r\\nsurroundings.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe same forms are observed at a home christening, the hour being usually\\r\\nin the afternoon.\\r\\n\\r\\n[MANNERS AND SOCIAL CUSTOMS 749]\\r\\n\\r\\nA luncheon to which the clergyman and the christening party, and a few\\r\\nfriends if desired, are invited, customarily follows the church\\r\\nceremony--unless several children of other families are baptized at the\\r\\nsame time--and always follows the home christening. It is not unusual to\\r\\nmake some recognition of a clergyman\\'s services at a church christening,\\r\\nand always is in order at the home rite, though it is not expected as a\\r\\nclergyman counts on his wedding fee.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf church or house is decorated for a christening, white flowers only are\\r\\nemployed, in conjunction with palms and ferns to relieve them. White\\r\\nlilies are particularly beautiful. The table is adorned with white\\r\\nflowers; the cakes and bonbons are white. Any desired refreshments may be\\r\\nserved, those for afternoon tea being suitable. That old-fashioned\\r\\nbeverage known as caudle is never served at any other time. It is\\r\\ndispensed in bouillon cups.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMOURNING ETIQUETTE.\\r\\n\\r\\nConduct of Funerals--\\r\\n\\r\\nSo brief the span between our birth and death that the etiquette of burial\\r\\nmay fittingly follow that of the christening ceremony. It might be\\r\\nsupposed that the funeral, especially the private, could be conducted\\r\\nwithout formality. But informality often means disorder, and simplicity\\r\\nwithout order is confusion. There is no time where lack of order and\\r\\nsystem so grate on one\\'s nerves as at a funeral. The less \"fuss\" on such\\r\\nan occasion the better, and for that reason, the routine of meals should\\r\\ngo on as usual, though no one seems to have the heart to eat them. Still,\\r\\nit is in a way a comfort to most people to feel the chain of accustomed\\r\\nhabit; it brings a trifling sense of relief.\\r\\n\\r\\nSave in the case of a person who has been prominent in the public eye,\\r\\nthere is no excuse, or reason, for any but a private funeral. Time was\\r\\nwhen not to hasten to the house of death was thought unkind; not to attend\\r\\nthe funeral of an acquaintance a mark of disrespect. We have changed all\\r\\nthat. We do not expect the uninvited to attend our weddings and\\r\\nreceptions, why should they come at times of much more intimate and\\r\\npersonal emotion--those times when we can hardly endure the words and\\r\\npresence of those we love best? What the sensitive have endured at the\\r\\nhands--or tongues--of well-meaning but clumsy sympathizers--not\\r\\ninfrequently curious as well as sympathetic--only those who have suffered\\r\\ncan relate. In addition to the natural grief experienced, the members of\\r\\nthe family are usually worn out with nights of watching and days of\\r\\nanxiety; it is a fresh strain to be obliged to see people, relate\\r\\nsick-room details and listen to stereotyped condolences.\\r\\n\\r\\n[750 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Undertaker.--Cases are rare where there is not some \"next friend\" who\\r\\nis competent to see the undertaker, and arrange details with him. In fact,\\r\\nthe undertaker may well be put in charge. He should be competent and\\r\\nexperienced. A clumsy, fussy undertaker is an affliction.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe undertaker will obtain the physician\\'s certificate as to the cause of\\r\\ndeath, without which in many cities a burial permit cannot be issued. He\\r\\nwill secure the necessary permit, see to the preparation of the grave, and\\r\\nthe purchase of a lot if necessary, arrange the house for the funeral,\\r\\nfurnish the bearers, and secure the requisite number of carriages; and,\\r\\nbefore the family returns from the cemetery, have the funeral\\r\\nparaphernalia out of the house, so that the maids or whoever is left in\\r\\ncharge can restore the rooms to their wonted order. Everything possible is\\r\\ndone to spare the grief-stricken.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Duties of the Next Friend.--The actual duties devolving upon the\\r\\nperson representing the family include ascertaining their wishes as\\r\\nregards the officiating clergyman and his notification of their desire and\\r\\nthe hour of the funeral; for music, if any is desired; the selection of a\\r\\ncasket, and determining the number of carriages to be ordered. A written\\r\\nlist of relatives and friends who will go to the cemetery, arranged in\\r\\norder of their relationship, four in a carriage, is given the undertaker\\r\\nfor his guidance in assigning those present to their places. The friend of\\r\\nthe family will accompany the undertaker to the cemetery if a lot must be\\r\\npurchased, or he may go alone, the undertaker receiving his instructions\\r\\nfrom the cemetery authorities. If any special position is desired for the\\r\\nnew grave, this will be definitely stated. With this knowledge, an\\r\\nundertaker will conduct a burial so quietly and decorously that as a\\r\\nbereaved wife once remarked, it was \"a real comfort to have John buried.\"\\r\\nShe did not quite mean what she implied, however.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhere means suffice, a black cloth-covered casket with silver mountings is\\r\\nchosen. If the interment is in a vault, a metallic casket is obligatory.\\r\\nThe child\\'s casket is white; that for a young person is white or\\r\\npearl-gray.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is no longer necessary to call on friends and neighbors to bear the\\r\\ndead to their last resting-place, though it may be done. Honorary\\r\\npall-bearers are chosen among the associates of the dead in case he is a\\r\\nprominent personage; the active may be relatives, or undertaker\\'s\\r\\nassistants. A child is sometimes borne by his or her little school\\r\\nfriends, though it seems a pity to call on children for such offices.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe House Funeral.--At the house funeral the family remains upstairs, or\\r\\nis seated in the room with the casket, the former more customary. The\\r\\nclergyman stands at the head of the casket, or in the doorway, that his\\r\\nvoice may be heard. At the conclusion of the service, those not going to\\r\\nthe cemetery quietly disperse; the carriages drive up; the undertaker in a\\r\\nlow voice assigns the relatives to them in proper order, and the cortege\\r\\nmoves off. At the grave, the remainder of the solemn service is read, the\\r\\ncasket lowered, and all is over.\\r\\n\\r\\n[MANNERS AND SOCIAL CUSTOMS 751]\\r\\n\\r\\nThat dreadful custom known as \"viewing the remains,\" by which those\\r\\npresent file past the casket for a last look at the dead, is obsolete. The\\r\\nbereaved take their farewell before any arrivals; those who desire to\\r\\nbehold the face of the dead do so as they enter, then are seated in\\r\\nanother room. Sometimes the casket is closed before the funeral.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChurch Funerals.--The church funeral is more dignified, perhaps, but much\\r\\nless common than a few years ago. Good taste counsels that our leaving,\\r\\nlike our arrival in this world, be a purely family affair. Those who\\r\\nattend a church funeral are in their seats when the cortege arrives. The\\r\\norgan is softly played as the casket is borne up the aisle, the clergyman\\r\\npreceding it; its rests before the chancel, the clergyman reads the burial\\r\\nservice from the step, the mourners, who have followed the casket, being\\r\\nseated in the front pews. The procession retires in the same order, the\\r\\ncongregation dispersing afterwards.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFlowers.--Flowers are usually ordered the day before the funeral, to\\r\\narrive in the morning, that they may be fresh. Cards are removed before\\r\\nthey are taken to the cemetery. Colored flowers, preferably those of pale\\r\\ntints, are admissible, though American Beauties are not infrequently sent.\\r\\nWreaths of galax leaves are often ordered for the funeral of an elderly\\r\\nperson; sometimes half of the wreath is of the leaves and the remainder of\\r\\nflowers. Wreaths and sprays are almost invariably sent by private\\r\\nindividuals, the stereotyped \"emblems\" like \"the broken wheel,\" \"gates\\r\\najar,\" etc., being the offerings of clubs, or other organizations to which\\r\\nthe deceased may have belonged. Where there is a great quantity of\\r\\nflowers, the loose sprays are often sent to the sick in hospitals, only\\r\\nenough to cover the grave being reserved. The visitor to a cemetery could\\r\\nfind it in his heart to wish that when the beauty of these floral\\r\\nofferings has departed, the sodden remnants might be speedily removed.\\r\\nThey speak so forcibly of forgetfulness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMOURNING GARMENTS.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe custom of wearing mourning after a bereavement is almost universal.\\r\\nEven the poorest endeavor to show their grief by donning a few shreds of\\r\\nblack, while among the well-to-do an entire new wardrobe is felt to be\\r\\nobligatory. However our religion bids us look forward to a more perfect\\r\\nexistence in the beyond, however truly death may be a relief from pain and\\r\\nsuffering, custom, that makes cowards of us all, must be followed. Often\\r\\ntoo, mourning garb is but the visible evidence of the gloom that oppresses\\r\\nus spiritually. In spite of our faith, our sense of loss and loneliness is\\r\\nbest expressed in sad raiment and abstinence from pleasures. Often it\\r\\nwould be kindness to the living to go our way as usual, but that is not in\\r\\nharmony with our hearts.\\r\\n\\r\\nMourning is in a manner a protection to a woman. Strangers respect her\\r\\nsorrow and refrain from the jocular. Behind her crepe she may defy\\r\\nintrusion. But it often becomes a hardship to the young.\\r\\n\\r\\n[752 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I missed all my youth,\" complained a middle-aged woman. \"We were a large\\r\\nfamily. A brother died when I was sixteen and we went into mourning and\\r\\nshut ourselves away from entertainments. Then my father died; next a\\r\\nsister, and another brother, so that, looking back, I can remember but one\\r\\ngown I had, between the age of sixteen and thirty-one, that was not\\r\\nblack--and the one exception never had a chance to get worn out.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Expense of Mourning.--Mourning, however, is sometimes a distraction.\\r\\nIn deciding about trimmings and the width of crepe hems many a woman\\r\\nforgets her woe, for a time at least. Mourning wear is expensive, and to\\r\\nclothe a whole family in black totals no inconsiderable sum. Many families\\r\\nhave been financially swamped through the expenses of an illness, a\\r\\nburial, and the conventional mourning. In this instance, as in the case of\\r\\nweddings, all these things should be regulated by common sense. A costly\\r\\ncasket, a profusion of flowers and a long funeral procession merely\\r\\ngratify a foolish and ostentatious pride on the part of the survivors, and\\r\\noften entail a heavy burden on the father or husband.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is quite customary to borrow the black garments worn at the funeral.\\r\\nThese should be returned immediately after the funeral, with a message or\\r\\nnote of thanks.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is well to look over one\\'s wardrobe to see what garments may be colored\\r\\nfor use during the period of mourning. The art of the dyer has made such\\r\\nprogress that very satisfactory results are obtained, and quite wealthy\\r\\npeople do not hesitate to resort to this expedient.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMourning Wear.--Crepe, ugly, expensive and easily ruined by dust and\\r\\ndampness, is no longer indispensable to a mourning outfit. If used at all,\\r\\nit is in the form of hems or narrow bands on face veils and as borders or\\r\\nfacings, on gowns. Even widows, who wear the deepest mourning, no longer\\r\\nwear crepe veils.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll dress materials for mourning wear have a dull finish. Henrietta,\\r\\nimperial serges, tamese cloth and nun\\'s veiling are the standard fabrics.\\r\\nA lusterless silk is sometimes employed, also crepe de chine.\\r\\n\\r\\nCrepe is used as a trimming only during the first period of mourning. Hats\\r\\nhave almost entirely replaced bonnets, except for elderly widows, who\\r\\noften adopt the close-fitting Marie Stuart bonnet, with the white ruche\\r\\ninside the brim. A long veil of fine silk nun\\'s veiling is worn with this,\\r\\nwith a tulle or net face veil with a narrow fold of crepe. Veils of crepe\\r\\nor nun\\'s veiling are not worn over the face except at the funeral.\\r\\n\\r\\nHats with crepe folds and trimmings, with veils arranged to fall in folds\\r\\nin the back are usually selected; with them is worn a plain net face veil.\\r\\nDotted veils are not mourning. Black furs, lynx, fox or Persian lamb are\\r\\nworn.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany women wear narrow lawn turn-over collars and cuffs; they are\\r\\nhemstitched, with no other decoration. Black-bordered handkerchiefs are no\\r\\nlonger carried; if, however, one\\'s woeful trappings must extend to this\\r\\ndetail, the narrower the edge the better.\\r\\n\\r\\n[MANNERS AND SOCIAL CUSTOMS 753]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEither black glace kid or suede gloves are worn. Shoes and slippers must\\r\\nbe in a dull kid finish.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll white may be worn in summer during the later period of mourning, but\\r\\ncombinations of black and white are not mourning; thus a white dress with\\r\\nblack ribbons is not correct.\\r\\n\\r\\nJewelry (in gold), ostrich feathers, velvet, lace, satin, and jet\\r\\ntrimmings, except in dull jet, are barred. One may wear a diamond or pearl\\r\\nring or two, but no colored jewels set in rings. Some women have outer\\r\\nshells made in black enamel to enclose diamond ear-rings they are\\r\\naccustomed to wearing.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf one wears mourning, she should hold to the correct form. If, however,\\r\\nshe elects to wear black, more license is permitted her. Whatever is done,\\r\\nshould be consistent. Thus if she simply adopts black she may have a net\\r\\nor all-over lace yoke in a gown, may wear hats with wings and quills or\\r\\nfancy feathers in black, or black flowers--which are botanical\\r\\nmonstrosities--whereas in correct mourning she could not.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Period of Mourning.--The length of time during which mourning is to be\\r\\nworn has been considerably shortened of recent years. Widows formerly wore\\r\\ndeep mourning-crepe, bombazine, etc., for two years, and \"second\\r\\nmourning\" for another year. Now, even among the most rigid sticklers for\\r\\nform, two years is the limit, and there is a tendency to diminish this\\r\\nperiod. Eighteen months of woe inconsolable; six months of grief assuaged.\\r\\nNor are all recreations debarred the widow, as formerly; she may go to\\r\\nconcerts, small entertainments, even to matinees, after some months have\\r\\nelapsed. This is as it should be. Many women have settled into gloom and\\r\\ndespondency which have darkened their homes because there has been nothing\\r\\nto lift them out of their low frame of mind.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a parent, a grown son or daughter, the conventional period is two\\r\\nyears, one year of deep mourning. For a young child a mother wears black\\r\\nfor a year. The same time suffices for a brother or sister. Six months\\r\\nanswers for grandparents; three for an uncle or aunt. Often one does not\\r\\nwear mourning except for husband, child or parent.\\r\\n\\r\\nYoung girls need not wear mourning as long as an adult does, nor do they\\r\\nwear crepe, unless it be a hat with crepe trimmings, or one with ribbon\\r\\nbows and face veil with crepe border. It seems as unnecessary as it is\\r\\nunkind to put young children into black.\\r\\n\\r\\n[754 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrench Mourning.--The French, with characteristic cheerfulness, greatly\\r\\nabridge the mourning attire, dividing it into three grades, deep, ordinary\\r\\nand half-mourning. For the first only woolen materials in black are\\r\\nemployed; the second, silk and woolen; the third gray and violet. The wife\\r\\nlaments her husband for a year and six weeks,--six months of deep\\r\\nmourning; six of ordinary, and six weeks of gray and violet melancholy.\\r\\nThe bereaved husband, on the other hand, is let off with six months of\\r\\nsorrow, three in deep mourning, three in ordinary; he has not to pass\\r\\nthrough the gray-and-violet stage at all.\\r\\n\\r\\nSix months is also the period for parents, evenly divided between deep and\\r\\nordinary. One gets off with two months for brother, sister or grandparent,\\r\\nand three weeks suffices for a mere uncle or aunt. Good taste decrees\\r\\nmourning should be discarded gradually. From black one may go to quiet\\r\\ncostumes in dark colors, gray being an approved hue.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMourning for Men.--Custom sets more lightly upon men than upon women in\\r\\nthe matter of mourning. Here, as elsewhere, the details of etiquette\\r\\ndevolve upon women. A widow would incur censure if she married within two\\r\\nyears after her husband\\'s death; indeed, if her marriage followed soon\\r\\nafter the expiration of that term, Mrs. Grundy would infer some\\r\\nsurreptitious courting had been going on. A man, however, may marry again\\r\\nafter a year has elapsed. A widower would abstain from society and the\\r\\ntheater for six months. A parent is mourned for a year.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe correct attire for men is a black suit, black gloves and tie of\\r\\ngrosgrain or taffeta silk, and a black band upon his hat. The tailor\\r\\nadjusts this hat band with scrupulous nicety to the depth of his\\r\\naffliction. It is deepest for a wife; it diminishes mathematically through\\r\\nthe gamut of parents, children, brothers or sisters.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe widower is not expected to wear mourning for two years, unless he\\r\\nprefers to do so. If he goes into the niceties of the garb he will wear\\r\\nblack enamel shirt studs and cuff buttons, and a plain black watch fob.\\r\\nAfter a year he may wear a gray suit, retaining the black accessories.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe custom, followed in some circles, of wearing a black band on the left\\r\\ncoat sleeve, is to be emphatically condemned. The place for the band is on\\r\\nthe hat. If not placed there, let it be nowhere. On a gray or tan coat the\\r\\neffect is startling. The custom of wearing such a band as emblem of\\r\\nmourning for a fellow member in a lodge, or any organization, whether worn\\r\\nby man or woman, is more honored in the breach than the observance. Better\\r\\ndrape the departed member\\'s seat in black, or hang crepe on the charter\\r\\nthan follow this foolish fad.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Duties of Friends.--Where there is sickness in a family, friends call\\r\\nto make inquiries or to proffer assistance. Kindness counsels that such\\r\\ncalls should be brief; often duties press heavily upon the well, and the\\r\\ntime spent in receiving visitors may be sadly needed for rest, or for\\r\\nother duties. To stay to a meal or to take children on such a visit is\\r\\ninconsiderate, to say the least. If help is needed, give it quietly,\\r\\nunobtrusively, and as efficiently as possible. A little service rendered\\r\\nby a thoughtful neighbor is always appreciated, whereas the person who\\r\\ngoes \"a-visiting\" where there is sickness comes near being a nuisance.\\r\\n\\r\\n[MANNERS AND SOCIAL CUSTOMS  755]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn town, friends call at the door to make inquiries. Unless very intimate,\\r\\nthey do not expect to see any member of the family. Cards are left, and it\\r\\nis correct to write \"To inquire\" on the card. If death follows, cards are\\r\\nproperly left, either before the funeral or within a week after the event.\\r\\nUpon these may be written \"with deepest sympathy.\" One does not ask to see\\r\\none of the family. Cards of this character are often sent by mail, and are\\r\\nacknowledged within three weeks by sending one\\'s visiting card with narrow\\r\\nblack edge and envelope to match. Across the top of the card is written\\r\\n\"With grateful appreciation of your sympathy,\" or \"It is a comfort to feel\\r\\nthat we have your sympathy in our loss.\" Cards are sometimes especially\\r\\nengraved for this purpose. Such cards have a mourning border and are\\r\\nenclosed in an envelope and mailed. One\\'s visiting card, with narrow black\\r\\nedge and black-bordered envelope, is sent in acknowledgment of invitations\\r\\nto weddings, receptions, etc. If a note is necessary in reply to an\\r\\ninvitation, it is written on note-paper having a narrow mourning border,\\r\\nand follows the customary formula, the border being an indication of the\\r\\nreason it is declined.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn case the request \"Kindly omit flowers\" is made in the obituary notice,\\r\\nthe wish of the family should be observed.\\r\\n\\r\\nLetters of condolence should be written as soon as possible. Friends\\r\\nshould not be afraid to intrude. If they feel a sincere sympathy it should\\r\\nbe allowed expression, for such tributes, coming from the heart, are\\r\\nalways grateful to the stricken. Answers to such letters should not be\\r\\nexpected; it is customary to acknowledge them by a card, as above\\r\\nmentioned.\\r\\n\\r\\nFriends who send flowers should be thanked, either by note, or word of\\r\\nmouth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE ETIQUETTE OF CORRESPONDENCE.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Letters should be easy and natural, and convey to the persons to whom we\\r\\nsend just what we would say if we were with them.\"--Chesterfield.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThey say nobody has time to write letters these days, and yet the post\\r\\noffice department handles millions of them each year. True, they are not\\r\\nthe formal, lengthy, somewhat stilted epistles of a century ago, when a\\r\\nlad began his home letters \"Honoured Parents,\" and your correspondent\\r\\nannounced, \"I take my pen in hand to inform you,\" etc. The letter of\\r\\ntoday, however, is not less the messenger of good-will and remembrance\\r\\nthan it was in those days. It remains largely the bulletin of business and\\r\\nof family affairs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe postman\\'s bag! What may it not contain? News of birth or tidings of\\r\\ndeath, of lover\\'s vows made or broken, of achievements or misfortunes.\\r\\nEvery letter is like a new day; we cannot tell what its message may be.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is no mean accomplishment to be able to write a good letter.\\r\\n\\r\\n[756 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Essentials.--The first essential to letter-writing is to have\\r\\nsomething to say, and the ability to say it well. This is a talent that\\r\\nmay be cultivated. The next requisite is good paper. Better curtail in\\r\\nsome other item and allow yourself good, plain, heavy paper and envelopes.\\r\\nAvoid all fancy papers, whether in tint or design. Plain white or cream\\r\\nlaid paper is always good form. Whatever the vagaries of the stationer,\\r\\nthe plain white, fine quality paper is to be preferred. The intertwined\\r\\ninitials of the writer are often placed at the top of the first page,\\r\\neither in the center or at the left-hand corner where the water-mark used\\r\\nto be. These are done in gold or silver, or some pale tint. Just now, the\\r\\nstreet address of the writer is often engraved across the flap of the\\r\\nenvelope. The form of the latter, whether square or oblong, varies\\r\\naccording to the passing fashion. Whichever is used, the letter sheet is\\r\\nfolded once to fit it. Sealing-wax is little used at present; if at all,\\r\\nthe \"blob\" of wax is small, only large enough to receive the impress of a\\r\\nsingle initial on the seal.\\r\\n\\r\\nUse a good black ink. Violet and purple inks are as passe as colored\\r\\nstationery. There is a certain writing-fluid, bluish when first used, and\\r\\nturning black after a few hours\\' exposure, that is standard.\\r\\n\\r\\nWrite legibly. Handwriting may or may not be an index of character, but it\\r\\ncertainly does indicate certain attributes. A cramped, slovenly, awkward\\r\\nhandwriting is naturally associated with a careless and uneducated person;\\r\\nwhereas a free, graceful and trained hand indicates culture and refinement\\r\\nin the writer. We say again, write legibly. Nothing is more exasperating\\r\\nthan certain examples of modern fad-writing, where one might as well\\r\\nattempt to translate a page of Chinese script. Despite the typewriter, one\\r\\nshould endeavor to be a good penman, because the typed letter or note is\\r\\ninadmissible in polite society, being reserved for the world of business.\\r\\nAvoid also the microscopic calligraphy with a fine pen; it is very trying\\r\\nto your correspondent\\'s eyes, unless she happens to have a reading-glass\\r\\nconveniently near.\\r\\n\\r\\nTake pains to make your signature easily decipherable. Remember that while\\r\\na word may be puzzled out by the context, or by the analogy of its letters\\r\\nto others, the signature has no context, and is often so carelessly\\r\\nwritten that the letters composing it are indistinguishable. One should be\\r\\nparticularly careful in this respect where writing business letters or\\r\\nletters to strangers.\\r\\n\\r\\n[MANNERS AND SOCIAL CUSTOMS 757]\\r\\n\\r\\nLetter Forms--Ceremonious letters, and notes in the first person are\\r\\naddressed to My dear Mrs. Smith. If Mrs. Smith is a friend or an\\r\\nacquaintance, she is addressed as \"Dear Mrs. Smith.\" This is the American\\r\\ncustom, and is an exact reversal of the English. which is, by the way,\\r\\nbeing more generally adopted in our society. \"My dear\" certainly seems to\\r\\nthe uninitiated, at least, more intimate and familiar than \"Dear.\" A\\r\\nbusiness communication to a stranger begins--\\r\\n\\r\\n    Mrs. Joseph Smith,\\r\\n      Dear Madam:--\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are shades of courtesy to be observed in signing letters. \"Sincerely\\r\\nyours\" is a little more formal than \"Yours sincerely;\" \"Yours with much\\r\\nregard\" is more familiar than \"Yours sincerely.\" \"Yours truly\" is for the\\r\\nbusiness letter; \"Yours affectionately\" for the family or those to whom\\r\\nwe are much attached. The rule has been to capitalize all the words of the\\r\\naddress, but only the first word of the conclusion, as \"My Dear Friend\\r\\nMary\" and \"Yours sincerely,\" but of late this rule seems to be broken in\\r\\nregard to the address, which is now often written \"My dear Mrs. Smith.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAbbreviations.--Abbreviations are always incorrect. The month, day and\\r\\ndate must be spelled out; the street number and the year are correctly\\r\\nindicated in numerals. The year is sometimes spelled out on formal\\r\\ninvitations, but is regarded as an affectation in private correspondence.\\r\\nTo indicate a date in numerals, as 3: 18:  \\'12, is bad form. \"Street\" is\\r\\nnot shortened to \"St.\" and \"Avenue\" is to be spelled out. The city and\\r\\nstate should be written in full. \"Cal.\" and \"Col.\" are often wrongly read\\r\\nby busy railway clerks, and your Colorado letter goes to California.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe character and (&) is never to be employed. \"Hon.,\" \"Dr.\" and \"Rev.\"\\r\\nare permissible on an envelope; \"Rev. Father\" is incorrect; write \"Rev.\"\\r\\nWe do not use \"Esq.\" in America as much as it is used in England, where it\\r\\nis always employed in addressing a letter to an equal, \"Mr.\" being\\r\\nreserved for tradesmen. Here we use \"Mr.\" almost entirely. Christian names\\r\\nare not abbreviated in an address; one should write \"George\" or \"Charles\"\\r\\nrather than \"Geo.\" or \"Chas.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat Not to Do.--A woman is never to be addressed by her husband\\'s title,\\r\\neither verbally or in writing. \"Mrs. Dr. Smith\" is \"Mrs. Lewis Smith\";\\r\\n\"Mrs. Judge Morris\" is \"Mrs. Henry Pond Morris.\" Of course she would not\\r\\nthink of signing herself \"Mrs. Dr. Smith.\" She should sign herself by her\\r\\nown name, \"Marion Morris.\" If necessary to convey the information, she\\r\\nmay, in a business note, place Mrs. in brackets, before her name, or after\\r\\nsigning her own name, write below it, \"Mrs. Henry Pond Morris.\" This is\\r\\nnever done in a social note. Often, upon her marriage a woman includes her\\r\\nmaiden name in her signature, thus, \"Marion Ames Morris.\" A hyphen is not\\r\\nused. The four-storied name, as \"Marion Helen Ames Morris,\" is too\\r\\ncumbersome for common use.\\r\\n\\r\\nA woman uses her husband\\'s full name on her cards. The man, in signing\\r\\nhimself, writes his full name \"Henry Pond Morris\" or \"R. P. Morris,\"\\r\\nrather than \"Henry P. Morris.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe postscript has been laughed out of existence. If a few words must be\\r\\nadded the \"P. S.\" is omitted. Dodging about on the pages, from first to\\r\\nthird, then to second and fourth, is to be avoided. Don\\'t write across\\r\\nyour written pages; a plaided letter is so difficult to decipher that one\\r\\nis justified in destroying it unread. One is supposed to have sufficient\\r\\nletter paper on hand. A half sheet should never be used as a means of\\r\\neking out an epistle. Don\\'t send a blotted, smeared letter.\\r\\n\\r\\n[758 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nPlacing the Stamp.--Several years ago silly girls occasionally inquired\\r\\nthrough the newspapers as to \"the significance\" of the postage stamp when\\r\\nplaced in certain positions on the envelope. One paper made reply that to\\r\\nplace it anywhere but on the upper right hand corner of the envelope\\r\\nindicated that the sender was a first-class idiot. The answer was widely\\r\\ncopied and the inquiries ceased. The stamp is placed there for convenience\\r\\nin canceling, that being done by a machine in all but the smaller offices.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe last item to be remembered is, spell correctly, though it is one of\\r\\nmuch importance. A mis-spelled word is a grievous error in a letter--worse\\r\\nthan a blot. Keep a dictionary on the desk; when in doubt look up the\\r\\nword, and then take pains to fix it in mind so as to have no further\\r\\ntrouble with it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen to Write.--Notes of invitation should be promptly answered. So should\\r\\nbusiness letters. As for friendly letters, were they answered at once, by\\r\\nboth parties, the exchange would be so brisk that too much time would be\\r\\nthus occupied. One may let a reasonable time elapse before replying; this\\r\\ndepending upon the intimacy. Friends whose time is much taken up with\\r\\nother cares, but who do not wish to lose touch with each other, not\\r\\ninfrequently agree to exchange letters at certain dates or anniversaries.\\r\\nBoth may write simultaneously, or one write and the other reply.\\r\\n\\r\\nMake it a point to re-read the letter you are about to answer, and take\\r\\npains to reply to any questions your correspondent may have asked. Nothing\\r\\nis more maddening than to make several important inquiries and find them\\r\\nwholly ignored while your friend tells you how busy she is, how many\\r\\nengagements she has in the future, how tired she is, and prefaces these\\r\\nuninteresting details with a long apology for her silence. Who was it said\\r\\n\"An apology is a mistaken explanation\"?\\r\\n\\r\\nPostal cards are not considered in correspondence. They are to be used\\r\\nonly for business, or where one is traveling and wishes to inform her\\r\\nfriends of her whereabouts. The picture or souvenir postals are largely\\r\\nused for this purpose. But the postal card, in correspondence, is like a\\r\\ncall when the lady is out and you do not leave your card--it doesn\\'t\\r\\ncount.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn regard to love-letters, bear in mind what Rousseau says:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To write a good love-letter you ought to begin without knowing what you\\r\\nmean to say, and finish without knowing what you have written.\" Then,\\r\\nhaving unbosomed yourself, don\\'t send it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCare in Writing.--It is well to remember, that once you have dropped a\\r\\nletter into the box, it is no longer yours. It belongs to the person to\\r\\nwhom it is addressed. If you have been indiscreet, the matter is out of\\r\\nyour hands. Therefore, be careful what you write. You cannot tell what use\\r\\nyour correspondent may make of it. Your friend may be trustworthy, but\\r\\ncareless; some one may be dishonest enough to read it; it may be lost. It\\r\\nis a good plan to write nothing you would not be willing to have read\\r\\nbefore a roomful of people who know that you wrote it.\\r\\n\\r\\n[MANNERS AND SOCIAL CUSTOMS 759]\\r\\n\\r\\nAvoid personalities. Don\\'t commit your unflattering opinions of other\\r\\npeople to paper. The letter is a witness whose veracity is unquestioned.\\r\\n\\r\\nDon\\'t read your letters to others, unless they are family letters in which\\r\\nall may rightly have a share. A letter is a private communication.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nKeeping Letters.--It is a bad plan to keep old letters, especially if they\\r\\nare of a personal nature, or if they contain confidences or secrets. When\\r\\nthe owner dies, there is no knowing to what use they may be put. One\\r\\nregrets the publication of the private letters of great men and women,\\r\\nshowing, as they so often do, the foolish, silly, conceited side of a\\r\\ncharacter we have admired. Private letters are often disillusioning, or\\r\\nbetray the presence of the skeleton of the family, unhappiness or\\r\\ndisgrace.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe safest way is to keep a letter till it is answered, then destroy it,\\r\\nThis does away with a lot of useless lumber.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLetters of Congratulation and Condolence.--It is not possible to give\\r\\nforms for letters of this character. They are meaningless unless they come\\r\\nfrom the heart, and should be characterized by sincerity. Nevertheless,\\r\\nthey should be written, and promptly, as also letters of acknowledgment of\\r\\ngifts, favors offered, and the \"bread-and-butter letter\"--the missive you\\r\\nwrite to your hostess after a few days\\' visit. Letters of condolence are\\r\\nespecially difficult to write. One so fears to wound instead of\\r\\ncomforting. If one can offer some quotation that has been a personal help\\r\\nin time of sorrow, it is often gratefully appreciated. But because we\\r\\n\"don\\'t know what to say\" we must not omit writing. The letter is often a\\r\\ngreater kindness than the call, which is a tax upon the strength of the\\r\\nmourner.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The path of sorrow, and that path alone, leads to the land where sorrow\\r\\nis unknown; no traveler ever reached that blessed abode who found not\\r\\nsorrows in his road.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Wherever souls are being tried and ripened in whatever commonplace and\\r\\nhomely way, there God is hewing out the pillars for His temple.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDo not think you must write a long letter. A few well chosen phrases,\\r\\nsincere expressions of feeling, are more grateful to one who grieves. One\\r\\nmay say:\\r\\n\\r\\n   My dearest Friend:--\\r\\n     It is with sincerest sorrow I have just heard of your great\\r\\n   bereavement. I cannot hope to comfort you; God only can do that, but I\\r\\n   want to say how deeply and tenderly I feel for you in your sad\\r\\n   affliction.\\r\\n                   Believe me, most faithfully yours,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[760 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the other hand, if we must congratulate, we may write:\\r\\n\\r\\n  I have just heard of your engagement to Mr. Blank, and wish to be among\\r\\nthe first of your friends to express my sympathy with you in your\\r\\nhappiness. I have known Mr. Blank for some time, and greatly admire his\\r\\nmany good qualities. I am sure you are very happy with him, and will be\\r\\nmore so as you grow together in marriage. Hoping good fortune and joy may\\r\\nalways be your portion in life, and present bliss an earnest of more in\\r\\nstore for you, I am,\\r\\n                              Most sincerely yours,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMANNERS FOR MEN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Politeness and good breeding are absolutely necessary to adorn any or all\\r\\nother good qualities or talents.\"--Chesterfield.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThough what we call society is largely vested in women, and women\\'s\\r\\ncustoms regulate etiquette, men are by no means exempt from the necessity\\r\\nof knowing and practising what we call good manners. A man can have no\\r\\ngreater charm than that easy, unstudied, unconscious compliance with\\r\\nsocial forms which marks what we call \"a man of the world\"--the man who\\r\\nknows what a good manner requires of him in any situation, and does it\\r\\nquietly and with the grace of habit.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere has been no time in the history of the world when good manners\\r\\ncounted for more than at the present. This is true of both men and women.\\r\\nIt is so true that in certain fields it is practically impossible to\\r\\nsucceed without their aid. The value of a pleasing manner can hardly be\\r\\noverestimated. Such a manner is as far from the self-assurance and\\r\\npresumptuous familiarity which some men assume under the idea that these\\r\\nare impressive, as night is from day.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nValue of Courtesy.--Courtesy has a commercial value, and exerts no little\\r\\ninfluence upon a man\\'s success in business. Polite attention and readiness\\r\\nto oblige bring customers again and again, where their lack would send\\r\\npeople to rival houses.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe can forgive, in the intellectually great, or in the man of affairs who\\r\\nhas done things worth doing, a lack of social training that would not be\\r\\nendured in a man with no such claim. Yet this is not saying that the great\\r\\nman would not command more unqualified admiration were he to practise the\\r\\nsocial graces instead of ignoring them. The truth is, the fact that we\\r\\nhave to overlook the absence of these graces induces a more critical\\r\\nattitude toward his achievements. Great though he be in spite of his lack\\r\\nof courtesy, we feel he would have been greater had he known and practised\\r\\nthe art of gentle manners.\\r\\n\\r\\n[MANNERS AND SOCIAL CUSTOMS 761]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Manners of the Gentleman.--These \"gentle-manners,\" that make the\\r\\n\"gentle man\" are an indispensable requisite to success in society. They\\r\\ntestify to a man\\'s good breeding, to his social affiliations; they \"place\\r\\nhim.\" They often bring a man many things that wealth could not.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rich boor is despised in spite of his money. The poor man may be\\r\\npopular because of his pleasing personality and his fine manner.\\r\\n\\r\\nMen sometimes profess to despise those refinements that are associated\\r\\nwith good manners, saying they detest affectations. But these things are\\r\\nnot to be affectations. They should be the outward expression of inward\\r\\nkindness and good-will and unselfishness. The cultivation of good manners\\r\\nis a duty; somebody has said that \"the true spirit of good manners is so\\r\\nnearly allied to that of good morals that they seem almost inseparable.\"\\r\\nJohn G. Holland says somewhere: \"Young men would be thoroughly astonished\\r\\nif they could comprehend at a glance how greatly their personal happiness,\\r\\npopularity, prosperity, and usefulness depend on their manners.\" Emerson\\r\\nremarked that,--\"Manners should bespeak the man, independent of fine\\r\\nclothes. The general does not need a fine coat.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA Matter of Training.--It may be that politeness is instinctive with some,\\r\\nbut with most men (women also), it is a matter of training and habit, and\\r\\ncareful discipline. In process of time courtesy becomes perfectly natural,\\r\\nso gracefully spontaneous it seems to be.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere is where the mother\\'s work in the early training of her sons comes\\r\\nin. Taught from childhood, by example and precept, the observances that\\r\\nmake for good manners, the young man wears them as easily and as\\r\\nunconsciously as he does his clothes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPoliteness an Armor.--There is no better armor against rudeness and\\r\\ndiscourtesy than politeness. The individual is impervious to slights and\\r\\nsnubs who can meet them with the courtesy which at once puts the common\\r\\nperson in his proper place as the inferior.\\r\\n\\r\\nA woman is shocked and repelled by disagreeable manners in a man,\\r\\nmanifested in discourtesy toward her, by an awkward manner, coarse speech,\\r\\nincivility, neglect of the little attentions she expects of a man and\\r\\nwhich men of breeding render as a matter of course. A woman is more likely\\r\\nto fall in love with a homely man of pleasing address than with an Adonis\\r\\nso clad in self-complacency that he thinks politeness unnecessary, or one\\r\\nwho does not know its forms.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE ETIQUETTE OF THE HAT.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first rule a man should observe in regard to his hat is never to wear\\r\\nit in the presence of women, save in the open. If mothers would take the\\r\\ntrouble to train their small sons to rigid observance of the rule of\\r\\nremoving their head covering the moment they enter the house there would,\\r\\nbe fewer adults guilty of this particular discourtesy, which is at once\\r\\nthe greatest and the most common. One occasionally sees a man wearing his\\r\\nhat and preceding a woman down the aisle of a theatre.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe expression, \"tipping the hat,\" is a vulgarism. A man doesn\\'t \"tip\" his\\r\\nhat, he raises it quite off his head.\\r\\n\\r\\n[762 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Coachman\\'s Salute.--The semi-military salute--raising the hand to the\\r\\nhat as if to lift it, but merely approaching the forefinger to the\\r\\nbrim--is a discourtesy to a woman. Such a salute would bring a reproof in\\r\\nmilitary circles; it is objectionable among men. Actually it is the manner\\r\\nin which a man-servant acknowledges an order from his master or mistress,\\r\\nand is not inaptly called \"the coachman\\'s salute.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA man wears his hat on the street, on the deck of the steamboat, in a\\r\\npicture-gallery or promenade concert-room. He removes it in a theatre, the\\r\\nopera-house, and the parlors of a hotel.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen to Raise the Hat.--Men raise their hats to each other on the street.\\r\\nThey extend the same courtesy to all members of their family, of both\\r\\nsexes. A well-bred man raises his hat to his little daughter, as he would\\r\\nto his wife.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the street, a man must wait for a lady to recognize him, but should be\\r\\nready to remove his hat simultaneously with her greeting, raising and\\r\\nreplacing it quickly. The fashion of removing the hat after meeting a lady\\r\\nis absurd. How does she know the courtesy has been extended?\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen a man is with a lady who recognizes an acquaintance, he must raise\\r\\nhis hat, whether he knows the individual or not. He should, however, keep\\r\\nhis eyes straight ahead, not looking at the person.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf he meets a man walking with a lady whom he does not know, he waits the\\r\\nman\\'s recognition.\\r\\n\\r\\nA man removes his hat in an elevator if women enter or are already inside.\\r\\nThis rule is often ignored in large public buildings.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf a woman bows to a man in any place where it is his privilege to wear\\r\\nhis hat, he removes his hat and does not replace it while she is talking\\r\\nwith him. This rule applies everywhere except on the street. \"A gentleman\\r\\nof the old school\" will stand bareheaded on the street if exchanging a\\r\\nword or two with a lady; in such case she may request him to replace his\\r\\nhat.\\r\\n\\r\\nA man when driving or motoring cannot remove his hat. He bends forward\\r\\nslightly and touches his hat brim with his whip, held upright, in the\\r\\nfirst case, and raises his hand to the visor of his cap in the latter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAt Other Times.--When he is able to render some slight service to a woman\\r\\nwhom he does not know, she will thank him with a slight inclination of the\\r\\nhead and a smile, and he should raise his hat. When he relinquishes his\\r\\nseat in the street car, he should give the lady a chance to acknowledge\\r\\nhis courtesy, and then raise his hat.\\r\\n\\r\\nMen raise their hats and stand uncovered as a funeral cortege passes into\\r\\nthe church or from a house, and at the grave.\\r\\n\\r\\n[MANNERS AND SOCIAL CUSTOMS 763]\\r\\n\\r\\nThey also stand uncovered when the United States flag is borne past, or\\r\\nthe national hymn--the \"Star Spangled Banner\"--is played in public, at a\\r\\nmilitary review, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen a man passes a lady in the corridor of a hotel, or on the stairway,\\r\\nhe should raise his hat.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he takes leave of a lady, the same act of deference is expected.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHat and Coat When Calling.--When calling, the man looks after his own hat,\\r\\novercoat and stick. His hostess does not offer to relieve him of them, nor\\r\\nsuggest the removal of his coat. He deposits his hat and stick on table or\\r\\nseat in the hall before entering the drawing-room, and takes off his\\r\\novercoat if his call is to be prolonged. Or, he may take them all with him\\r\\ninto the drawing room if his call is to be brief. In any event, it is his\\r\\nbusiness to dispose of them according to his own pleasure.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRULES FOR PRECEDENCE.\\r\\n\\r\\nA man precedes a woman in going down-stairs and follows her in going up.\\r\\nThis is that he may be in readiness to catch her should she fall.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe allows a woman to precede him on entering or leaving a room, and should\\r\\nopen the door for her.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn entering a hotel dining-room the man may precede the lady to the table\\r\\nassigned them, on the occasion of their first meal, standing until she is\\r\\nseated. Afterwards, he may follow her as the head-waiter leads the way.\\r\\nSometimes he permits her to precede him in the first case.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe question is sometimes asked who should follow the usher on entering\\r\\nchurch or theatre. The rule above stated obtains. The woman follows the\\r\\nusher; the man follows her.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man allows the lady to enter the carriage first, but descends before\\r\\nher that he may assist her to alight. The same rule prevails in regard to\\r\\nentering and leaving a street car, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nABOUT SMOKING.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old rule of good manners: \"A gentleman does not smoke in the presence\\r\\nof ladies,\" is many times violated in these modern times. There is a story\\r\\nof an elderly woman who, being asked if smoke was offensive to her,\\r\\nreplied: \"I do not know. No gentleman has ever smoked in my presence.\" The\\r\\nwoman of today is more likely to answer \"Oh, dear no! I love the odor of a\\r\\ngood cigar.\" The truth is the cigar has become such a constant and\\r\\napparently necessary adjunct to a man that to banish it is in effect to\\r\\nbanish the man. And women prefer to endure the smoke rather than have the\\r\\nman absent himself. There are very few cafes and restaurants where men do\\r\\nnot conclude their repast with a good cigar, even when entertaining\\r\\nladies.\\r\\n\\r\\n[764 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhere Not to Smoke.--Nevertheless, there are times and places when and\\r\\nwhere a man should not smoke. When he is about to meet a lady he knows he\\r\\nremoves his cigar before removing his hat and bowing. If he wishes to join\\r\\nthe lady, walking a short distance with her, he throws away his cigar\\r\\nbefore doing so. He does not smoke, when driving with a lady, unless\\r\\npossibly in the country. He should not smoke when walking with her--but he\\r\\noften does, with her full consent and permission. In fact, women, as has\\r\\nbeen said, are responsible for men\\'s lapses in the way of smoking.\\r\\n\\r\\nA guest does not smoke in his host\\'s house unless especially invited to do\\r\\nso, by his host, not some younger member of the family or another visitor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAt a dinner party at which ladies are present, men do not smoke until the\\r\\nladies have left the dining-room.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is a bad form to smoke when anyone is singing, unless in those\\r\\nfree-and-easy places of amusement where \"everything goes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout Expectoration.--No man should smoke, anywhere or at any time, who\\r\\ncannot smoke without using a cuspidor. It is a practice so much worse than\\r\\nsmoking, so thoroughly abominable in itself, that no man with any claim to\\r\\ngood breeding or good manners permits himself to indulge in it.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn most homes, nowadays, men are permitted to smoke \"all over the house.\"\\r\\nIt is better, wherever possible, to let the man have a \"den\" where he may\\r\\nsmoke with his friends. The practice of smoking in bedrooms is\\r\\nreprehensible; the air one will breathe through the night should not be\\r\\nvitiated.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBACHELOR HOSPITALITY.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A bachelor\\'s life is a splendid breakfast; a tolerably flat dinner;\\r\\nand a most miserable supper.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBeing a bachelor does not excuse a man from certain forms of hospitality.\\r\\nMany \"society men\" live in apartments, at the present time, and may\\r\\nentertain the ladies who have favored them with invitations; in fact, it\\r\\nis expected that a man who has often been entertained will reciprocate in\\r\\nsome fashion.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf a bachelor\\'s quarters are too restricted for any other form of\\r\\nentertaining, he may give a theatre party, followed by a supper at some\\r\\ncafe. Or he may do this without the theatre party. Of course, such an\\r\\nentertainment is expensive, but he must remember that the ladies who have\\r\\nentertained him have spent a good deal of money on their fetes.\\r\\n\\r\\n[MANNERS AND SOCIAL CUSTOMS 765]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bachelor and the Chaperon.--The first thing the bachelor must do is\\r\\nto secure a chaperon. She must be a married woman of unimpeachable\\r\\nreputation. Having done this, he invites the other members of the party,\\r\\nfirst submitting his list to her approval. The usual number is six, three\\r\\nmen and three women, or two men and four ladies. Two men may join forces\\r\\nto entertain a quartet of ladies, or more, and thus halve the expense. The\\r\\ncarriage or taxicab is sent first to the residence of the chaperon; the\\r\\nhost accompanies it or may meet it there. The other ladies are called for,\\r\\nthe other men generally meet the carriages at the theatre. The host sits\\r\\nnext the chaperon at the theatre and at the supper, placing her on his\\r\\nright.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf a supper is to follow, and it almost always does, the host has reserved\\r\\na table at the hotel or cafe and has perhaps ordered flowers and a special\\r\\nmenu in advance. He has also settled the account, so that he has only to\\r\\ncross the waiter\\'s palm with silver at the conclusion of the repast, in\\r\\nacknowledgment of faultless service.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCheaper Ways of Entertaining.--In summer there are cheaper ways in which a\\r\\nbachelor may payoff his social obligations. Most bachelors belong to\\r\\nclubs, where they may give luncheons or suppers. There are roof-gardens\\r\\nand outdoor vaudeville, open-air concerts, etc., that may be made\\r\\npleasurable occasions. He may charter a yacht, in company with several\\r\\nfriends, and entertain a dozen or half score ladies with a sailing party.\\r\\nAt all these, however, he must provide a chaperon.\\r\\n\\r\\nA very pleasant and informal way for a bachelor to entertain is to invite\\r\\nsome of his more intimate women acquaintances to afternoon tea at his\\r\\napartments. For this he writes personal notes or gives verbal invitations.\\r\\nHe asks some married, lady to assist him, placing it in the light of a\\r\\nfavor to himself. She must arrive early, and remain until the last guest\\r\\nhas left. The host pays the chaperon special deference, asking her to pour\\r\\nthe tea, and either escorting her home or ordering a carriage for her.\\r\\n\\r\\nElaborate refreshments are not necessary at such an affair. Sandwiches,\\r\\ncakes, tea, served in the American fashion or a la\\' Russe, are sufficient.\\r\\nThe chaperon presides at the refreshment table. All things needed for the\\r\\nrefreshment of the guests may be ordered from a caterer. If the affair is\\r\\nin the evening, chocolate and coffee may be served instead of tea, or\\r\\ncakes, coffee and ices.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bachelor\\'s Chafing Dish.--If the circumstances of the bachelor permit,\\r\\nhe may give a chafing-dish supper, presiding over the manufacture of a\\r\\nWelsh rarebit or lobster a la Newburg, making the coffee himself in a\\r\\nmachine. This might take the place of the supper at a restaurant after the\\r\\nplay. After such a supper, or a dinner in his rooms, the host escorts the\\r\\nladies to their carriages, and accompanies the chaperon to her home.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf none of these methods of entertaining chance to be within\\r\\nthe man\\'s means--for many poor men of pleasing address are social\\r\\nfavorites--he may fall back on the pretty compliment implied in sending\\r\\nflowers or bonbons, remembering that matrons as well as \"buds\" appreciate\\r\\nsuch attentions.\\r\\n\\r\\n[766 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Village Society.--In small towns and in the country, the young man\\r\\nwould ridicule the idea of having a chaperon along. He seldom considers\\r\\nthe question of repaying social invitations, or paying calls after an\\r\\nentertainment. He should be careful to show courtesy to the host and\\r\\nhostess, to dance with the latter and her daughter at a dancing party, and\\r\\nmay escort mother and daughter or the mother and some one of her friends,\\r\\nto a lecture or concert. Generally he ignores all claims of this\\r\\ncharacter. But he should not.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nShould He Offer His Arm?--A man seldom offers a woman his arm nowadays,\\r\\nunless she is so elderly or infirm that she needs the support. For a\\r\\ncouple to walk arm in arm in daylight is decidedly provincial. For a man\\r\\nto take a woman\\'s arm is a liberty not permissible unless she is a member\\r\\nof his family. He should offer his arm if holding an umbrella over her at\\r\\nnight, on a poorly lighted street or a country road at night. A woman,\\r\\nunless very infirm or ill, should not walk arm-in-arm with a man in\\r\\ndaylight.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Outside of the Walk.--A man usually walks on a woman\\'s right, in order\\r\\nto protect her if necessary, It looks absurd, however, for him to be\\r\\ndodging around her to keep on the outside of the walk unless some danger\\r\\nis to be encountered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMinor Matters of Men\\'s Etiquette.--A man should not carry a girl\\'s\\r\\nparasol; he should however assume any parcel she may be carrying.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen a man escorts a woman to her home it is not correct for him to linger\\r\\nat the door. He should accompany her up the steps, ring the bell and wait\\r\\nuntil she is admitted. If the hour is at all late he should not enter,\\r\\neven though invited.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is extremely bad form for a man to speak of a woman by her Christian\\r\\nname while talking to casual acquaintances. Though long acquaintance may\\r\\nsanction the familiarity at home, or among intimate friends, to all\\r\\noutsiders she should be Miss.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe custom of leaving the theatre between acts is inexcusable. If a man is\\r\\nescorting a lady, he is guilty of great rudeness if he leaves her,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCards and Calls.--If calling on a lady who is visiting a person who is a\\r\\nstranger to him, he must ask for her hostess, sending up a card for her as\\r\\nwell as for his friend. If calling with a lady, he should wait for her to\\r\\ngive the signal for departure.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man who attends an afternoon tea should leave a card for each lady\\r\\nmentioned in the invitation, and for the host, whether the latter was\\r\\npresent or not. He must send the same number of cards if unable to be\\r\\npresent, enclosing them all in an envelope which fits the cards,\\r\\naddressing it to the hostess, and mailing it so that it will be received\\r\\non the day of the function. He must call upon his hostess within two weeks\\r\\nafter an invitation to a dinner or ball.\\r\\n\\r\\n[MANNERS AND SOCIAL CUSTOMS 767]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn attending a tea or afternoon reception, the right-hand glove must be\\r\\nremoved before entering the drawing room, as it is bad form to offer a\\r\\ngloved hand to one\\'s hostess on such occasions.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf, when calling on a lady, another visitor arrives, the first comer must\\r\\nnot attempt to \"sit him out.\" He should make his adieux within a\\r\\nreasonable time after the second arrival, even though a friend in more\\r\\nintimate standing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBad Habits.--A man should carefully avoid mannerisms, such as twisting his\\r\\nmustache, fussing with his tie, fidgeting with some little article taken\\r\\nfrom a table, as a paper knife, etc. These awkwardnesses are the outcome\\r\\nof nervousness. He should strive at all times to be simple, at ease, and\\r\\nunconscious of himself. If he tries to \"show off\" he makes himself\\r\\nobnoxious.\\r\\n\\r\\nPicking the teeth, chewing a toothpick, cleaning the finger nails in\\r\\ncompany, are gross violations of propriety.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Car Fare Question.--A girl occasionally appeals to writers on social\\r\\nforms to find out when she should permit a man to pay her car fare. It is\\r\\nexpected that he will pay for her if he is escorting her, and she should\\r\\nallow him to do so without comment. If they happen on the same car by\\r\\nchance she should pay her own fare. If the man anticipates her, handing\\r\\nthe change to the conductor and saying \"For two,\" she should thank him\\r\\nsimply and let the matter pass. Really, it is not entirely good form for a\\r\\nman to pay a woman\\'s fare under such circumstances, unless she has\\r\\ndifficulty in finding her purse, or her change. Then he may say \"Allow me\"\\r\\nand pay for her. If she finds her money she may return the amount, and he\\r\\nshould take it without protest.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE ETIQUETTE OF DRESS.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The best possible impression that you can make with your dress is to make\\r\\nno impression at all; but so to harmonize its material and shape with your\\r\\npersonality that it becomes tributary in the general effect, and so\\r\\nexclusively tributary that people cannot tell after seeing you what kind\\r\\nof clothes you wear.\"--Holland.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMEN\\'S DRESS.\\r\\n\\r\\nA man--lucky creature--is not expected to change his clothes as frequently\\r\\nas a woman must. He wears morning dress until dinner, unless he is to\\r\\nattend some afternoon function, like a wedding or a reception. Dinner is\\r\\nnow almost universally at six or half after six o\\'clock. Before that hour,\\r\\nsave in the exception noted above, he wears a business suit, a derby or\\r\\n\"soft\" hat, tan shoes if he prefers them, or laced calf-skin shoes with\\r\\nheavy soles. The coat may be sack or cutaway. Such an outfit is correct\\r\\nfor traveling wear. A white shirt, or one of striped madras, is worn, with\\r\\na white linen collar. The tie is usually a four-in-hand in some dark\\r\\nshade.\\r\\n\\r\\n[768 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cutaway coat is correct for church wear. In summer it largely takes\\r\\nthe place of the frock coat, which, with the silk hat, is usually \"out of\\r\\nseason,\" so to speak, from about the middle of May until about the same\\r\\ntime in September. Straw or felt hats are worn.\\r\\n\\r\\nTweed flannel and cheviot suits are favorite summer wear for men, Flannel\\r\\ntrousers, white with flannel shirt and leather belt, constitute the usual\\r\\nwear for tennis, golf, etc., and blue cheviot or serge for yachting.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAfternoon Wear.--For formal afternoon wear the double-breasted frock coat\\r\\nof black worsted, with waistcoat of the same or of white duck, is\\r\\nreserved, dark gray pin-stripe trousers are worn with it, patent leather\\r\\nshoes, gray gloves, silk hat and standing linen collar. The standing\\r\\ncollar is for formal wear. This attire is suitable for all social affairs\\r\\nbetween noon and evening.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter dinner evening clothes--the \"dress suit\"--are worn. This has been\\r\\nfully described in the chapter on wedding etiquette, under the head of\\r\\ncorrect dress.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIncongruity in Dress.--A man must avoid incongruities in dress. Tan shoes\\r\\nare inadmissible with formal afternoon dress. They do not accompany a silk\\r\\nhat. A lawn tie is never worn save with evening clothes, nor a turn-down\\r\\ncollar with them. Gloves should be inconspicuous. A man\\'s hands encased in\\r\\nbright tan gloves make one think of sugar-cured hams.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Tuxedo is a dinner coat, hence never seen before six o\\'clock; it must\\r\\nnot be worn at a theatre party, or if a man escorts ladies. It may be worn\\r\\nin summer at informal dinners, and at summer hotels. Silk hat, white\\r\\nwaistcoat, or white lawn tie are not correct wear with a Tuxedo.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAPPROPRIATE DRESS FOR WOMEN.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe real beauty of dress resides in being suitably gowned. Suit the attire\\r\\nto the time and place. Fashion prescribes and regulates styles; etiquette\\r\\nsettles the appropriate garb for the occasion. Every detail, from shoes to\\r\\nhat, should be harmonious and suited to the occasion and consequently to\\r\\nthe hour of the day. But how many, many violations of this rule we see!\\r\\nOstrich feathers worn with shirtwaists; low shoes on the street; dressy\\r\\nhats in the morning; jewels at breakfast--all inappropriate and unrelated!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe correct street wear in the morning in the winter is a tailored suit\\r\\nwith medium sized hat in felt or beaver, walking shoes, and rather heavy\\r\\ngloves in glace kid. More elaborate suits or gowns in fine smooth cloth or\\r\\nvelvet are worn at afternoon functions, for calling and receptions. One\\r\\ndoes not choose light or showy colors for these if she must walk or take a\\r\\nstreet car. Ostrich feathers can be worn on the velvet or satin hat that\\r\\naccompanies this costume, which is completed by patent leather shoes and\\r\\nwhite or pearl-gray gloves.\\r\\n\\r\\n[MANNERS AND SOCIAL CUSTOMS 769]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Decollete Gowns are Worn.--High-necked and long-sleeved gowns are\\r\\nworn at every daytime function.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt balls, cotillions, formal dinners, evening parties, and in the large\\r\\ncities in opera boxes, decollete gowns may be worn.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo \"nice\" woman wears a low gown when dining at restaurant or hotel. The\\r\\nneck may be cut low, under a lace yoke, unlined, and the sleeves finished\\r\\nfrom the elbow with lace. Hats are worn.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne chooses a handsome velvet or other dressy material for a dinner dress,\\r\\nand wears with it her rarest jewels. Good taste and modesty forbid too\\r\\nlavish a display of shoulders. As a rule, in our average social life, the\\r\\nunlined lace yoke and collar and lace sleeves are preferred for dinner\\r\\nwear, the decollete gown being reserved for balls and cotillions.\\r\\n\\r\\nYoung girls\\' dancing gowns are never cut very low; the \"Dutch\" neck and\\r\\nthe slightly low round cut being preferred. A string of pearls, a fine\\r\\ngold chain and locket, or gold beads, which have been restored to favor,\\r\\nare the usual ornament.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor theatre wear, where one is not to occupy a box, one may wear a\\r\\nhandsome reception gown, or a handsome bodice and skirt. Shirt and\\r\\nlingerie waists are not appropriate theatre wear, unless one patronizes\\r\\nsome second-class house of amusement.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWearing the Hat.--The rule to bear in mind as to the wearing of hats is\\r\\nthis: At all daytime affairs, hats are kept on. At all evening\\r\\naffairs--musicales, concerts, receptions, the play, they are removed.\\r\\n\\r\\nTea-gowns and negligees are for the boudoir; the kimona is for the\\r\\nbedroom.\\r\\n\\r\\nGloves are removed at a luncheon or dinner. Of course they would not be\\r\\nkept on at a card-party or a tea. One may retain them at a stand-up\\r\\nsupper.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOrnaments.--An abundance of ornament is in bad taste. Don\\'t be one of the\\r\\nSee-me-with-\\'em-all-on type. A cheap ornament spoils a handsome costume,\\r\\nbetter none at all; too many ornaments, even if good, look tawdry.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt a certain fashionable summer hotel a young woman was seen dancing in\\r\\nhigh shoes and wearing a demi-trained lingerie gown over a petticoat of\\r\\nordinary walking length. She was certainly \"the observed of all\\r\\nobservers,\" but hardly the object of admiration.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Debutante\\'s Dress.--The debutante usually wears white on the occasion\\r\\nof her introduction to society. The material should be light and\\r\\nyouthful--crepe de chine, some soft white silk like messaline, chiffon or\\r\\norgandie being the usual choice, made with high neck and long sleeves if\\r\\nthe affair takes the form of an afternoon reception. Only a ball or\\r\\ncotillion permits a low gown, and then the gown is not \"low\" in the usual\\r\\nsense: it is merely cut out modestly in the neck and the sleeves are\\r\\nshort. In the afternoon her mother, who presents her, wears a handsome\\r\\nreception gown; her young friends, who \"assist,\" wear light colored,\\r\\ndressy gowns of chiffon, net, etc. At such an affair guests remove wraps\\r\\nbut retain hat and gloves.\\r\\n\\r\\n[770 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nDressing on a Modest Allowance.--The woman who wishes to be well dressed\\r\\nbut must produce that effect on a moderate allowance, must be particularly\\r\\ncareful in her purchases. She should confine herself to two colors, of\\r\\nwhich black will be one. She must choose conservative styles as well as\\r\\ncolors, and above all, she must study very closely the relationship of her\\r\\npurchases in order to avoid incongruities. A hat may be beautiful and\\r\\nbecoming and within her means, yet a very unwise purchase because it will\\r\\nnot harmonize with or be suited to the costume with which it is to be\\r\\nworn.\\r\\n\\r\\nNeat gloves and good shoes are items of dress not to be disregarded by the\\r\\nwoman who wishes to look well dressed. Shabby gloves are ruinous to a\\r\\nwell-dressed appearance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDRESS FOR ELDERLY WOMEN.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe woman who has been \"dressy\" in her youth must curb her fancy as she\\r\\ngrows older, and carefully avoid things that are \"too young\" for her. She\\r\\nmay \"love pink\" or pale blue, and because she could wear it when a girl,\\r\\nunwisely clings to it in her fifth and sixth decades. A bedizened old\\r\\nwoman dressed in a fashion suitable for one twenty years younger, is a\\r\\nsight more pitable than admirable. She must not permit the milliner or\\r\\ncostumer to convince her that she is still young enough to \"wear anything\"\\r\\nbut must try to have sense enough to distinguish what is suitable from\\r\\nwhat appeals to her because she would have looked well in it in her youth.\\r\\n\\r\\nErmine furs, for instance, are absurd on a woman of forty-five or fifty.\\r\\nThe dead white brings out the yellow in her complexion and the faded color\\r\\nof eyes and hair. A very light \"dressy\" hat makes the wrinkles more\\r\\nobvious.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Suitable.--Dark, unobtrusive colors, relieved by white lace at throat\\r\\nand wrists, hats modest in size and coloring, set off gray hair and\\r\\nmatronly figure far better than showy and more youthful garb. No elderly\\r\\nwoman should attempt to wear brown; somehow it kills her complexion if she\\r\\nis sallow. Black, very dark blue, the softer shades of gray, are generally\\r\\nbecoming if relieved with white. Lavender and mauve can be becomingly worn\\r\\nby those dear old white-haired ladies who have pretty complexions. The\\r\\nlemon-colored lady must avoid them. We must remember Joubert\\'s saying: \"In\\r\\nclothes fresh and clean there is a kind of youth with which age should\\r\\nsurround itself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMaterials must be as handsome as can be afforded; soft wool materials may\\r\\nbe chosen, cashmere, henrietta, voile, make up suitably. In summer most\\r\\nold ladies can wear white to advantage.\\r\\n\\r\\nSimplicity should be the guide as to styles. Leave the fussy and elaborate\\r\\nto younger women, and adopt a dignified simplicity.\\r\\n\\r\\n[MANNERS AND SOCIAL CUSTOMS 771]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDUTIES OF A CHAPERON.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The art of not hearing should be learned by all.\" Young America flouts\\r\\nthe chaperon. The young girl of the middle class guesses she can \"look out\\r\\nfor herself,\" and knows \"how to behave.\" Very often she doesn\\'t know, and\\r\\nsadly demonstrates her lack of the knowledge of life and good sense that\\r\\nwould enable her to avoid situations that create gossip. In European\\r\\nsociety the chaperon is indispensable and has an acknowledged and honored\\r\\nposition. In America, young women ridicule the idea and young men are\\r\\ndecidedly impatient of her presence. And yet in our more conventional\\r\\ncircles it is understood that she is a protection to the girls in her\\r\\ncharge, and an oft-needed restraint on young men who are inclined to be\\r\\ntoo free and familiar.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMothers as Chaperons.--A mother is her daughter\\'s best chaperon. Very\\r\\noften her health, her home duties and her own lack of social experience\\r\\nunfit her for such a duty. In that case, she should be glad to put her\\r\\ngirls in charge of some more experienced woman. If all young men were\\r\\nhonest and honorable and temperate, the unchaperoned girl would meet with\\r\\nfewer embarrassments. Think of the awkward plight of a girl should the\\r\\ncarriage or the taxicab break down as she is returning home, or the\\r\\nmiserable state of the girl whose escort at play or party has taken too\\r\\nmuch wine! These things don\\'t often happen, some one says. They do\\r\\nhappen--far more frequently than the world at large is aware.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChaperon\\'s Lot Not Easy.--The duties of a chaperon are so onerous that she\\r\\ndeserves much gratitude, rather than revilement, for undertaking them. She\\r\\nmust stay at balls and parties when she would infinitely prefer her bed;\\r\\nshe must frequent places of amusement that are tiresome to her but\\r\\nagreeable to her young charges; she must remain in the parlor, or in the\\r\\nadjacent room separated only by draperies from it, while the girt\\r\\nentertains men callers, and no woman enjoys being \"gooseberry;\" she must\\r\\ncheck too high spirits and prevent \"loud\" behavior. And she will many\\r\\ntimes know that her presence is resented, and sad to say, endure slights\\r\\nin the discharge of her duties.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChaperons a Social Help.--Nevertheless, if girls only knew it, the\\r\\nchaperon may be very helpful and aid them materially in having a good\\r\\ntime. She should be a woman of wide acquaintance, accustomed to good\\r\\nsociety. Then she will introduce the girls under her charge to nice men\\r\\nwhom they should know, and to partners for the dance; see that they are\\r\\ninvited to nice places, and that they are correctly dressed. She must have\\r\\ntact combined with dignity, and be able to reprove little lapses in\\r\\ndecorum so tactfully that youth will not take umbrage. She must make her\\r\\ncharges like her, and win and hold their respect. And it is very important\\r\\nthat she should know what not to see--\"the art of not hearing\"--yet she\\r\\nshould never overlook anything vital, It will be seen that she should be a\\r\\nperson of infinite tact, good nature and courage.\\r\\n\\r\\n[772 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chaperon of the Motherless Girl.--Nowdays, the wealthy widower,\\r\\ninstead of putting his young daughter at the head of the household,\\r\\nsecures some woman of good reputation and social standing as his\\r\\ndaughter\\'s chaperon. She is, practically, the feminine head of the house,\\r\\nand in so far as possible, takes a mother\\'s place with the girl. She sees\\r\\nto it that the girl has proper companionship and does not make undesirable\\r\\nacquaintances. She accompanies her on shopping expeditions, travels with\\r\\nher, attends theatres and parties with her, takes the head of the table if\\r\\nthe girl gives a luncheon, and everywhere strives to make life pleasant\\r\\nfor her young charge, giving up her own pleasure and convenience for that\\r\\npurpose.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven the young woman of twenty-five or twenty-seven, at the head of her\\r\\nfather\\'s household, or living in a hotel, should have a companion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAvoid Espionage.--And yet, with all this responsibility, the chaperon must\\r\\navoid anything like espionage. She must not open letters; she must not be\\r\\nprying and inquisitive; she must not give reasons for the girl she\\r\\nchaperons to regard her as \"a dragon.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA giddy, flirtatious chaperon is a disadvantage to a girl. She is so\\r\\ndesirous of securing attention and having a good time herself that she\\r\\nneglects her charge. Often she undertakes chaperonage chiefly or entirely\\r\\nin order to go about herself. Such a chaperon is worse than none at all.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Girl and the Chaperon.--A girl should remember that her chaperon\\r\\nstands in the relation of a mother to her for the time being, therefore\\r\\nany disregard of her chaperon\\'s suggestions or wishes is the same as\\r\\ndisregarding her mother\\'s. No well-bred girl ever does this--well, at\\r\\nleast not publicly. If her chaperon gently intimates that it is time to go\\r\\nhome, that she is dancing too many times with the same man, or \"sitting\\r\\nout\" too long, she should cheerfully comply with the hint. She should not\\r\\nvanish with an escort, leaving her chaperon and others--to wonder at her\\r\\nabsence, but at the close of every few dances, before the beginning of\\r\\nanother, ask to be taken to her chaperon. There her next partner will\\r\\nnaturally look for her.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe must at all times treat her chaperon with the utmost respect and\\r\\ndeference, remembering the lady is bestowing a favor by taking charge of\\r\\nher, and that it is often at her parents\\' request.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt a theatre party, bachelor\\'s tea, sailing party, excursion, etc., one\\r\\nmarried woman is sufficient chaperon.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe girl who works, the art and music student, may look after herself, but\\r\\nthe society girl must submit to the thralldom of the chaperon.\\r\\n\\r\\n[MANNERS AND SOCIAL CUSTOMS 773]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chaperon in Middle Class Society.--While the rules of etiquette are\\r\\nintended to be of general application, there are certain relaxations in\\r\\nmiddle class society not permissible in more fashionable circles. This is\\r\\nthe case as regard the chaperon. Many young men on moderate salary would\\r\\nnot feel they could afford to buy a ticket to the theatre or concert for a\\r\\nchaperon, or order a carriage. But is a girl then to be denied permission\\r\\nto accept the invitation? Under such circumstances middle class etiquette\\r\\nrequires that the young man shall be well known to the family as a person\\r\\nof good habits and reputation. The girl, however, is not supposed to\\r\\naccept an invitation to a supper afterwards. She may go to a dancing party\\r\\nat a private house or a club in case proper chaperons are provided for the\\r\\naffair and they almost invariably are. But it is better taste for a party\\r\\nof young people to go together under the care of a chaperon.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen a girl receives a young man visitor, her mother should always meet\\r\\nhim. She should enter the parlor, be introduced if he is a stranger,\\r\\nconverse for fifteen or twenty minutes, and excuse herself, leaving the\\r\\nyoung people to their tete-a-tete. No girl ever loses a young man\\'s\\r\\nestimation through being properly looked after.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder no circumstances should the young girl be allowed to accompany a\\r\\nyoung man on an excursion without a chaperon. She should not motor with\\r\\nhim alone; another pair of young people should go with them unless a\\r\\nchaperon is included.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGOOD FORM IN SPEECH.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It isn\\'t so much what you do; it is how you do it. Not so much what you\\r\\nthink as how you clothe your thoughts that enables you to make a pleasant\\r\\nimpression.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nGood breeding is shown in the use of words, quite as much as in manners.\\r\\nCorrect use is evidence of culture and personal refinement.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nUse of Slang and Colloquialisms.--Slang, we are often reminded, is\\r\\ncommon--meaning vulgar. And yet, there are some slang phrases that are so\\r\\nexpressive, and convey so much meaning in few words that the temptation to\\r\\nuse them is irresistible. Much use of slang, however, is very undesirable,\\r\\nindicating lack of refinement. We may be colloquial, but must eschew the\\r\\nvulgar.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong the words that are bad form we find \"folks,\" used instead of\\r\\n\"family\" or \"relatives.\" \"Ain\\'t\" is one of the most common improprieties\\r\\nof speech and one that has no standing whatever in good language.\\r\\n\"Gentlemen friend.\" \"lady friend,\" are vulgarisms. We should not speak of\\r\\nyoung men as \"fellows.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWe should say \"shops\" instead of \"stores,\" and \"station\" instead of\\r\\n\"depot.\" A depot is a place where provisions and stores are accumulated.\\r\\nJust how it came to be applied to a railway station is an etymological\\r\\npuzzle. The use of \"learn\" for \"teach\" is incorrect. \"Pupil,\" \"student\"\\r\\nand \"scholar\" are often used interchangeably, but incorrectly so. \"Pupil\"\\r\\nrefers to the younger classes in a school.\\r\\n\\r\\n[774 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nThose in the most advanced grade of a high school, and those in college\\r\\nare students; while scholar signifies those who are learned and out of\\r\\nschool. \"Dresser,\" \"bureau\" and \"dressing case\" are incorrectly applied to\\r\\na chest of drawers. \"Vest\" for \"waistcoat,\" and \"dress suit\" for \"evening\\r\\nclothes\" are incorrect. \"Visitors\" is in better taste than \"guests.\" \"Got\"\\r\\nis a word often used superfluously and always inelegantly. \"I have it\"\\r\\nsounds much better than \"I have got it\"; leave out \"got\" wherever you can.\\r\\nAs for \"gotten\"--it ought to be unspeakable.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t\" for \"doesn\\'t\" is, perhaps the most common grammatical error. \"I\\r\\ndon\\'t,\" \"you don\\'t,\" \"they don\\'t,\\' are correct. \"Don\\'t\" is a contraction\\r\\nof \"do not.\" You wouldn\\'t say \"he do not,\" \"she do not,\" would you? Then\\r\\ndon\\'t say \"he don\\'t,\" or \"she don\\'t.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a rule the simpler the speech the better. \"Residence\" for \"house,\"\\r\\n\"peruse\" for \"read,\" \"retire\" for \"going to bed\"--all these and their like\\r\\nsound stilted.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe use of French words and phrases is to be avoided, both in writing and\\r\\nspeaking. Generally they are mispronounced--as in the case of the very\\r\\naffected lady who spoke of \"Mrs. Brown, nee Smith,\" pronouncing \"nee\" as\\r\\nif spelled \"knee.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nForm of Address.--To acquaintances, a woman speaks of \"my husband\"; to\\r\\nfriends, she calls him by his Christian name. To servants, he is \"Mr.\\r\\nSmith.\" This is a rule often violated, so often in fact, that few are\\r\\naware of the impropriety of saying \"Mr. Smith\" to friends and\\r\\nacquaintances. The man employs the converse of the rule; it is \"my wife\"\\r\\nto acquaintances, etc. To speak of a daughter as \"Miss Mary\" or \"Miss\\r\\nJane\" to anyone but a servant is insulting, placing the person thus spoken\\r\\nto on a par with an inferior. If formality is desirable one should say \"my\\r\\ndaughter Mary.\" The same rule applies to a son.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt has already been said that we do not address a wife by her husband\\'s\\r\\ntitle. He is Dr. Brown; she is Mrs. Brown. Mrs. General, Mrs. Judge, are\\r\\nnot current in polite circles.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe do not use \"Sir\" in addressing equals. Children no longer say \"sir\" or\\r\\n\"ma\\'am\" to their parents, but \"Yes, father,\" or \"No mother.\" Ma\\'am is\\r\\nseldom heard now except from old-fashioned servants. Maids and\\r\\nmen-servants say \"yes, Mrs. Smith,\" or sometimes, \"No, madam.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCourtesy in Conversation.--\"Things said for conversation are chalk eggs,\"\\r\\nsaid Emerson. There are many chalk eggs on the market. Most of us feel\\r\\nthat to \"be sociable\" we must talk incessantly. True, there are sometimes\\r\\ndreadful pauses in conversation when no one seems able to think of\\r\\nanything to say, and the longer the pause the more vacuous one\\'s mind.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat passes for conversation at receptions, dinners, ordinary social\\r\\naffairs, is merely chatter made up, of persiflage and repartee. One must\\r\\nbe able to furnish it, however, for small talk is conversational \"small\\r\\nchange,\" without which it is not easy to \"do business.\" Lacking it, one is\\r\\nlike Mark Twain\\'s man with the million dollar check and not change enough\\r\\nto buy a postage stamp.\\r\\n\\r\\n[MANNERS AND SOCIAL CUSTOMS 775]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSUBJECTS OF CONVERSATION.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo one can tell another person what to talk about. Advice on that subject\\r\\nis valueless. There are some things we may do, however, to make ourselves\\r\\nagreeable in conversation. We may study the art of expressing ourselves\\r\\nclearly,--saying what we wish to say without circumlocution. Some people\\r\\nseem to begin in the middle of a subject and talk both ways.\\r\\n\\r\\nAvoid personalities in your conversation. Don\\'t talk about yourself;\\r\\nnobody is interested in your personal perplexities and troubles. Don\\'t\\r\\nrecite your \"symptoms\" nor tell what the doctor says, nor what diet he has\\r\\nprescribed. Nothing, positively nothing, is so tiresome. Don\\'t indulge in\\r\\nanimadversions upon the absent, nor make sarcastic remarks about them.\\r\\n\\r\\nTry to discover some subject in which your companion is interested, and\\r\\nget him to talking. Then show yourself a good listener. A woman may get\\r\\nthe reputation of being bright and clever if she will simply show herself\\r\\na good listener. To do this, she must give her attention to the person who\\r\\nis talking. She must seem interested. Her eyes must not wander around the\\r\\nroom; she must not take up picture or book and glance over it; her\\r\\nquestions must be intelligent and to the point. Then, unless the speaker\\r\\nis a well-known bore, she need never suffer under the imputation of being\\r\\nneglected in society, and she will be thought courteous and intelligent.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDiscourtesies.--To interrupt a speaker, to take the words out of his mouth\\r\\nand finish the sentence for him, to broach a new topic, irrelevant to that\\r\\nin hand, unless the latter is in danger of leading to thin conversational\\r\\nice,--all these are discourtesies.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo yawn while listening to anyone; to show lack of interest in a story or\\r\\nanecdote that is being told, or let the attention wander, is marked\\r\\nimpoliteness. We are not to remind a speaker that his story is an old one,\\r\\nor that he has told it before.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSome Things to Avoid.--A man should avoid raving over the perfections, the\\r\\nbeauty or chic of one woman to another. He shouldn\\'t talk golf to one who\\r\\ndoesn\\'t know the language of the game, nor discourse on music to the\\r\\nunmusical. Above all, he shouldn\\'t undertake to entertain the whole\\r\\ncompany, nor introduce a topic in which he only is interested or informed.\\r\\nThe more serious questions of life are barred in society; people wish to\\r\\nbe amused, not instructed. An inveterate talker, especially one of a\\r\\ndidactic turn, is a bore. So is the man who puts a hobby through its\\r\\npaces. Avoid exaggerations in conversation, also extravagances, such as\\r\\n\"beastly this\" or \"awfully that,\" also avoid over emphasis. Don\\'t talk in\\r\\nitalics.\\r\\n\\r\\n[776 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Speaking Voice.--A clear, distinct enunciation should be cultivated.\\r\\nThe voice need not--should not--be raised above the ordinary\\r\\nconversational level to make one perfectly understood, if only one speaks\\r\\nclearly. This is something that can be cultivated. So also a\\r\\ndiscrimination in the use of words, so that which most nearly expresses\\r\\nthe meaning of the speaker comes to him readily.\\r\\n\\r\\nA pleasant voice is a charm, either in man or woman. A noted teacher of\\r\\nsinging once remarked that the cultivation of the speaking voice is a\\r\\npositive duty, and possible to almost everyone. Certainly a harsh,\\r\\nsqueaky, shrill or affected tone of voice may be improved by care and\\r\\nendeavor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHURCH ETIQUETTE.\\r\\n\\r\\nSurely the church is the place where one day\\'s truce ought to be allowed\\r\\nto the vanities, the dissensions and animosities of mankind.--Burke.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe church is sometimes sarcastically referred to as \"the social\\r\\nstepping-stone.\" It is a fact that the newly made rich and the vulgar\\r\\noften choose a church attended by the people of fashion whose acquaintance\\r\\nthey most desire, rent a high-priced pew, and become prominent through\\r\\ntheir benefactions and their services in church work. They are \"taken up,\"\\r\\nafter a time, in a fashion, and unless too socially impossible through\\r\\nlack of good breeding, may, from \"fringers,\" become \"climbers.\" \"I might\\r\\ngo to that church for a hundred years and no one would notice me,\"\\r\\nbitterly complained a woman who had undertaken the social uplift via the\\r\\nchurch. The woman in question defeated her own object. She dressed in the\\r\\nextreme of style; she always came in late, with much rustle of silk and\\r\\nrattle of bangles; her hair was \"touched up\" and her face rouged. The\\r\\nwell-bred and refined members condemned her on these grounds.\\r\\nNevertheless, where a stranger comes who bears the hall-mark of culture\\r\\nand refinement, the church connection is often an aid to social\\r\\nhabilitation, though it should never be sought as such.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFriendly Advances.--Friendly advances generally come from pew neighbors.\\r\\nRespond to them courteously but without undue eagerness. Do not expect\\r\\nyour pastor to become your social sponsor with his congregation, and\\r\\nremember that though he will probably call after letters of church\\r\\nmembership are presented, you have no claim upon his family, nor the\\r\\nfamilies of any of the church officers through acquaintance in business\\r\\nlife. This is often a grievance to people from smaller towns who, moving\\r\\nto a city, expect the families of their business associates to assist them\\r\\nsocially. Two men may be partners for ten years without their wives\\r\\nknowing each other by sight, if they chance to move in different social\\r\\ncircles.\\r\\n\\r\\nDemeanor.--One should dress quietly at church, give attention to the\\r\\nservice and the clergyman, and not linger unduly in the vestibule to\\r\\ngossip or greet friends. To notify the usher if one\\'s pew will not be\\r\\noccupied is a courtesy if the preacher is popular and the church crowded.\\r\\nTo be disagreeable in case strangers are shown to one\\'s pew, or mistakenly\\r\\nseated there, is unkind and unchristian. Giggling, smiles, exchange of\\r\\nsmiles or bows in the church proper are regarded as bad form.\\r\\n\\r\\n[MANNERS AND SOCIAL CUSTOMS 777]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNEIGHBORHOOD ETIQUETTE.\\r\\n\\r\\nNeighborliness is a quality little exercised in cities, where one may live\\r\\nnext door to people for years and merely know their names. Some people\\r\\nprefer not to know their neighbors, fearing undue familiarity on their\\r\\npart. The relationship may be a very pleasant one if both parties observe\\r\\ncertain restraints. It is not well to become too intimate. Nobody wants a\\r\\nneighbor running in at all hours, with or without an errand. Sometimes to\\r\\nsit on the back porch with a book or paper seems to invite a neighbor to\\r\\n\"run over\" and the hour\\'s rest or mental recreation is given over to small\\r\\ntalk.\\r\\n\\r\\nA neighbor has no more right to enter without knocking than any other\\r\\ncaller, whether by kitchen or front door. It is an intrusion, a disregard\\r\\nof the reserve that should characterize neighborly intercourse. No matter\\r\\nhow friendly, friendship will last longer where the forms of decorum are\\r\\nobserved.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBorrowing.--The exchange of \"kitchen-kindnesses\" should be ventured upon\\r\\nrarely. By these is meant the plate of cookies or biscuit or doughnuts we\\r\\nsend our neighbor on baking-day. Some families prefer their own cooking. A\\r\\nwoman who had been annoyed by many unsolicited donations of this kind,\\r\\npersisted in though unreciprocated, finally piled the sent-in biscuit\\r\\nrather ostentatiously on the garbage can in full sight of her neighbor\\'s\\r\\nwindow. Other hints had failed, this was effective--a rather violent\\r\\nremedy, but after all not undeserved. In case of illness, where one has no\\r\\nmaid, or the family must care for the sick, a fresh cake or a tasty\\r\\ndessert may be offered, and will seldom fail of appreciation. Knowing the\\r\\ncircumstances, one need not hesitate over the proffer of a neighborly\\r\\nkindness.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is little excuse in the city for the borrowing of kitchen staples\\r\\nwhich is the bane of some country neighborhoods. A borrowing neighbor is\\r\\nan affliction--a nuisance which unfortunately doesn\\'t come under the\\r\\njurisdiction of the Board of Health.\\r\\n\\r\\n[778 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nCARRIAGE ETIQUETTE.\\r\\n\\r\\nA story is told of a certain great lady who visited at the court of a\\r\\nreigning monarch on a secret matrimonial mission. The monarch had three\\r\\ndaughters; the emperor of her own country had a marriageable son. Before\\r\\novertures were made for an alliance, the lady was to see the three\\r\\nprincesses and decide which one should be honored by the proposal. It was\\r\\nher whim to rely upon \"the carriage test.\" She watched the young\\r\\nprincesses as they alighted from the royal carriage. The oldest one\\r\\ndescended clumsily, displaying too much of the royal lingerie. The second\\r\\nskipped out, disdaining the step. The third descended gracefully and with\\r\\ndignity, and Cupid\\'s ambassador decided she would make the most fitting\\r\\nempress.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt certain finishing schools, lessons in deportment include training in\\r\\nhow to enter and leave a vehicle gracefully. Stepping out on the\\r\\nright-hand side, the right foot is placed on the step, the left naturally\\r\\nfalls on the ground. Entering, the left foot is first advanced. In this\\r\\nway the other foot clears the body of the carriage without awkwardness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMinor Items.--The rule that the owner of the carriage occupies the\\r\\nright-hand seat even when accompanied by a guest, is almost universally\\r\\nobserved. The only exception seems to be when the guest is a person of\\r\\nunusual distinction.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo place one\\'s carriage at the disposal of a friend is a great courtesy,\\r\\nand should never be abused by the recipient. In case of accident the\\r\\noccupant should pay the bills for repairs, or at least urge that she be\\r\\nallowed to do so.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf a lady invites a friend to pay calls with her, dropping her companion\\r\\nto call on some acquaintance while she goes on to see a friend of her own,\\r\\nthe lady thus favored must not keep her waiting on her return, more than\\r\\nthe few moments necessary to make her adieux.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCIVILITY IN PUBLIC.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne is shocked, often, at the prevalence of rudeness in human intercourse.\\r\\nPeople who are courteous in the drawing-room are sometimes horribly\\r\\nuncivil in public. They crowd and jostle and elbow in thc endeavor to\\r\\nsecure better places for themselves, violating every canon of politeness.\\r\\nWomen have fainted, gowns have been ruined and valuable articles lost in\\r\\n\"crushes\" incident to gatherings in \"our best society.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMany people carry an umbrella with utter disregard of the eyes and\\r\\nheadgear of the passing crowd. Closed, it is tucked under the arm, the\\r\\nferrule projecting behind on a level with the face of a pedestrian. They\\r\\ngo through a heavy door, pushing it open for themselves and letting it\\r\\nswing back against the next comer. They step in advance of those who have\\r\\nprior claim to be shown to seats, and accept civilities and service\\r\\nwithout so much as a \"Thank you.\" They endeavor to obtain \"something for\\r\\nnothing\" by piling their luggage into seats they have not paid for on the\\r\\ntrain; on the boat they fortify themselves in a circle of chairs that are\\r\\n\"engaged\"--generally to hold their wraps and lunch-boxes, while others\\r\\nlook in vain for seats.\\r\\n\\r\\n[MANNERS AND SOCIAL CUSTOMS 779]\\r\\n\\r\\nRude Tourists.--Tourists have a reputation for a disregard of the rights\\r\\nof others, which makes them obnoxiously uncivil. They enter a church where\\r\\nworshipers are kneeling and audibly criticise the architecture and\\r\\ndecorations, or the faith to which it is consecrated. They comment\\r\\nflippantly on great pictures in art galleries, and snicker over undraped\\r\\nstatues, evincing the commonness of their minds and their lack of\\r\\nknowledge of art. But one of the worst lapses of decorum is to sit in a\\r\\ntheatre and anticipate the action of the play, or the development of a\\r\\nmusical number, by explanations to a companion. To do so may show\\r\\nfamiliarity with the play or the score, but it also shows a painful lack\\r\\nof good breeding, and a disregard of others\\' rights to peaceful enjoyment.\\r\\nOn a par with this is the incivility of a person who undertakes to\\r\\naccompany a soloist with his (or her) own little pipe, to the annoyance of\\r\\nthose who prefer to listen to professional rather than amateur efforts.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course all these rude people excuse themselves by saying they \"get\\r\\nleft\" if they don\\'t \"rush,\" and that they \"paid for their seats,\" as if\\r\\nthis atoned for their disregard of those who, equally with themselves,\\r\\nhave paid for a pleasure spoiled for them by the greed or impertinence of\\r\\ntheir fellow men--and women.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTelephone Etiquette.--\"Central\" could disclose how discourteous many women\\r\\nwho pique themselves on their good manners can be when they are \"calling\\r\\ndown\" the tradesman who has made a mistake in filling their order. And how\\r\\noften a party line is held for a lengthy \"telephone visit\" while others\\r\\nwait their really important affairs because the \"line\\'s busy!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe manners of the public need reforming. Civility is a public good.\\r\\nWithout it, we would be barbarians. It is the practical application of the\\r\\nGolden Rule to everyday life. To lay aside our own courtesy because we are\\r\\nin a crowd, or among people who do not know us, reduces us below the level\\r\\nof those who are not versed in the social requirements, because we know\\r\\nthem and should practise them, whereas they do not know.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDUTIES AND DRESS OF SERVANTS.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn many large and well-to-do households in this country only one maid, the\\r\\n\"girl for general housework\" is engaged, the mistress and her daughters\\r\\nassisting with the lighter parts of the work. In such case each must have\\r\\na certain definite portion of the daily duties and be responsible for its\\r\\nperformance. Very few maids are capable enough to do all the work of a\\r\\ngood sized family without assistance, even though the linen be sent to the\\r\\nlaundry.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe One Maid.--Where but one maid is kept she must rise early and put in a\\r\\ncouple of hours\\' work before breakfast, airing the house and perhaps\\r\\nputting in order and dusting the living rooms, then preparing breakfast.\\r\\nShe will probably serve it unless everything is put on the table, in which\\r\\ncase she may busy herself in the kitchen, washing the rougher dishes used\\r\\nin preparing the meal. The mistress of each household must make out her\\r\\nown schedule for the week, according to the convenience of the family.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe maid is supposed to have her dress changed by three o\\'clock. She will\\r\\nwear a simple but neat cotton gown about her work, mornings; in the\\r\\nafternoon she will put on a black dress with white apron, collar and\\r\\ncuffs. She is expected to keep a clean apron in the kitchen to slip on if\\r\\nsummoned to the door before luncheon. She should never answer the bell\\r\\nwith her sleeves rolled up. The mistress provides the white apron with\\r\\nshoulder pieces, the linen cuffs and collar worn by the maid of all work\\r\\nin the afternoon and evening. These are the mistress\\'s property, remaining\\r\\nin the family through the changes of servants. So many girls object to the\\r\\ncap that it is seldom seen save in very formal establishments. If worn,\\r\\nthe mistress furnishes it.\\r\\n\\r\\n[780 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nInstructing the Maid.--If the mistress finds her maid\\'s education in her\\r\\nduties is deficient, she should teach her to open the door wide, as if the\\r\\nvisitor were welcome; to have her tray ready to receive cards; to be\\r\\ninformed as to whether the mistress is at home or not that she may answer\\r\\nthe visitor\\'s inquiry at once. She is to usher the visitor into the\\r\\ndrawing room or parlor, take the card to her mistress and return to say\\r\\nthat \"Mrs. Blank will be down in a few minutes,\" never alluding to her\\r\\nmistress as \"she,\" as some ill-trained girls do.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf a lady who keeps but one maid entertains at all she must instruct the\\r\\ngirl in the proper serving of meals. In the first place, everything that\\r\\nis necessary for the service must be ready; there must be no getting out\\r\\nof extra silver or china at the last moment, with its upsetting confusion.\\r\\nThe menu must be so carefully planned that most of the food to be served\\r\\ncan be prepared beforehand. For a six o\\'clock company dinner, the soup may\\r\\nbe hot in the kettle; the fowl or joint in the oven; the entree waiting\\r\\nthe finishing touches on the back of the range, the vegetables in the\\r\\nwarmer, and the dessert in the ice-box. All the china and silver being in\\r\\nreadiness and the table properly laid, the maid slips into her black dress\\r\\nand apron, and presents herself at the drawing-room door, announcing\\r\\n\"Dinner\\' is served.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Maid\\'s Serving.--The guests being seated, she brings in the soup\\r\\ntureen, uncovers it, taking the cover to the pantry as she goes for the\\r\\nhot soup plates. She then stands at the left of the mistress with a tray,\\r\\ncovered with a doily, in her left hand, a folded napkin under the tray;\\r\\ntakes the soup plates as they are filled, passing them to the left of each\\r\\nguest, taking the plate from the tray with the right hand. She then\\r\\nremoves the tureen. Removing the plates she takes them from the left side\\r\\nof the guest. The roast is brought in and served in the same manner as the\\r\\nsoup; the vegetables are passed, each guest helping himself from the dish.\\r\\nThe salad is usually served on the plates upon which it has been arranged.\\r\\nAfter the salad the table is cleared and the crumbs brushed with a napkin\\r\\nupon a plate or tray, and the dessert brought on for the hostess to serve,\\r\\nThe latter starts the little dishes of bonbons or salted nuts on their\\r\\ntravels, guests passing them along.\\r\\n\\r\\nChocolate is a good beverage to serve on such occasions; it can be made in\\r\\nthe morning, or even the day before, and heated without in the least\\r\\nimpairing its quality.\\r\\n\\r\\nGiven a capable, willing girl, one anxious to learn and not too\\r\\nself-conscious, a woman may entertain two or three or four guests very\\r\\nadequately if she will plan her menu carefully and see, personally, that\\r\\neverything is in readiness. She should, however, avoid any\\r\\noverelaboration. Better a simple meal well prepared and served than a more\\r\\npretentious one that fails in these particulars.\\r\\n\\r\\n[MANNERS AND SOCIAL CUSTOMS 781]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuties of Waitress and Cook.--Where two maids are kept they are waitress--\\r\\n\"second girl\" or \"housemaid,\" sometimes so-called--and cook. The\\r\\nhousemaid--we will so style her--opens and airs the house and dusts and\\r\\narranges the rooms before breakfast. She serves the breakfast, clears the\\r\\ntable and washes the dishes taken from it. She then proceeds to the\\r\\nbedrooms, putting them in order, dusting, making beds, etc. She will\\r\\nprobably have fine lingerie waists, etc., to wash and iron on certain\\r\\nmornings. She does the sweeping, unless there is a man to take out and\\r\\nbeat the rugs, and wipes up hardwood floors. She must clean the silver\\r\\nonce a week and rub up brass; keep the pantries in order, clean the\\r\\nbathrooms, wait on table, answer the bell, both the door bell and her\\r\\nmistress\\'s bell, and usually assist the latter in dressing. She is\\r\\nexpected to do part of the family mending, keeping table linen and bed\\r\\nlinen in good condition, and in some households is expected to wash and\\r\\niron the napkins and dish-towels, unless a laundress is employed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Cook\\'s Work.--The cook must prepare the meals, and put the food into\\r\\nthe proper dishes and these in the pantry, ready for the waitress, who is\\r\\nnot expected to enter the kitchen during the service of a meal. She washes\\r\\nthe dishes used in the kitchen and the meat dishes from the table; she\\r\\nmust keep the kitchen and its adjuncts, including back stairs,\\r\\nrefrigerator, back porch and closet in order. Her mistress plans the meals\\r\\nwith her, and she is expected to make good and economical use of\\r\\nleft-overs. She often does the ordering by telephone, and sees to the\\r\\nmilk, ice, etc., as they are delivered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nShould Understand Duties.--Most of the difficulties between servants arise\\r\\nfrom misunderstanding of and friction about their respective duties. It is\\r\\nbest to have a definite and thorough understanding as to the work expected\\r\\nof each before engaging her. Both cook and housemaid have one afternoon\\r\\nand one evening each week and every other Sunday afternoon. When one is\\r\\noff duty the other must necessarily assume part of her work. Some\\r\\nmistresses allow a girl the afternoon and evening of one day; others give\\r\\none afternoon, and the evening of another day, requiring the cook to\\r\\nreturn to prepare dinner on her \"day\" and the maid to come back to serve\\r\\nit on hers. If afternoon and evening go together the cook is expected to\\r\\nleave everything in readiness for the evening meal; the cook, on the\\r\\nhousemaid\\'s day out, must wait upon the table.\\r\\n\\r\\nServants always respect a mistress who knows her rights, exacts them, and\\r\\nrespects her servant\\'s rights. She should permit no familiarities; at the\\r\\nsame time she must not regard her household assistants as mere machines,\\r\\nbeyond her sympathy, Good mistresses make good servants.\\r\\n\\r\\n[782 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Nurse.--The nurse must wash and dress the children; keep their clothes\\r\\nin order, washing and ironing the finer articles; eat with them, keep the\\r\\nnursery in order; sleep in the room, or in a room adjoining them with the\\r\\ndoor open, and take care of them when they are ill. A nursery governess\\r\\nteaches them, and is excused from the laundry work and from keeping the\\r\\nnursery in order.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mistress who can conduct her domestic menage with two servants only is\\r\\nusually better served and with less friction than where more are employed.\\r\\nRarely can three servants get on harmoniously. The more servants there\\r\\nare, unless there is a housekeeper, the more shirking there is, and the\\r\\nmore waste and extravagance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSUMMARY.\\r\\n\\r\\nRemember--\\r\\n\\r\\nThat, in introducing people the man must always be introduced to the\\r\\nwoman.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat the younger woman, the unmarried, the less socially prominent, are\\r\\nintroduced to the older, the married and the more renowned..\\r\\n\\r\\nThat to pronounce names distinctly avoids much awkwardness to those\\r\\nintroduced.\\r\\n\\r\\nA casual meeting on the street does not necessitate an introduction.\\r\\n\\r\\nNever present yourself with a letter of introduction. Leave it at the\\r\\ndoor.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat a card represents a visit, and that leaving your name in this way\\r\\nmakes your friend your debtor.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat after dinners, luncheons, theatre and card parties a call is\\r\\nrequired, whether the invitation is accepted or not.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn invitation to a wedding must be acknowledged by sending cards to those\\r\\nin whose name the invitation was issued, and may, if she so pleases, call\\r\\non the bride on her return from her wedding journey.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne should send announcement cards rather than invitations to those with\\r\\nwhom acquaintance is slight.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn invitation to afternoon tea does not require reply. Leave cards if\\r\\npresent.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe etiquette of calling on an \"at home\" day does not differ from that of\\r\\nan ordinary call, save that some light refreshment is offered, as a rule.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat the bachelor and the widower should respond to every invitation\\r\\nwhether accepted or declined, by calling and leaving cards, whereas the\\r\\nmarried man\\'s wife may leave his cards with her own. Men ignore this rule\\r\\na great deal, however.\\r\\n\\r\\n[MANNERS AND SOCIAL CUSTOMS 783]\\r\\n\\r\\nCards must be engraved, never written or printed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat a married woman uses her husband\\'s full name on her cards; that a\\r\\nman\\'s name always has the prefix Mr., and an unmarried woman\\'s or young\\r\\ngirl\\'s that of Miss, and that \"pet\" names are not \"good form\" on cards.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe extreme limit of a call is twenty minutes, and the first caller to\\r\\narrive should be the first to depart.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat you should not prolong your leave-taking.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat the lady invites the man to call, and being thus complimented he\\r\\nshould soon avail himself of the permission.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is the mother\\'s place to invite young men to call, not the daughter\\'s,\\r\\nthough she may say \"My mother would be pleased to have you call on us,\"\\r\\nThe mother must then meet and assist, for a time at least, in entertaining\\r\\nhim.\\r\\n\\r\\nA first call must always be returned. Afterwards the acquaintance need not\\r\\nbe continued.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not at home\" is no discourtesy to a caller if she is so informed when the\\r\\nmaid opens the door. The maid should know whether her mistress wishes to\\r\\nsee callers or not.\\r\\n\\r\\nP. p. c. on a card means \"To take leave,\" and intimates your friend is\\r\\nleaving town for a season.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is customary for mother and daughter to use a card on which hath names\\r\\nappear when calling together. A debutante, in our most conventional\\r\\nsociety, has no separate card of her own. If she calls without her mother,\\r\\nshe uses this double card, running a pencil mark lightly through her\\r\\nmother\\'s name.\\r\\n\\r\\nSisters may use a card in common; it should be engraved \"The Misses\\r\\nJones,\" and used when calling together or sending gifts.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe divorced woman, if she drops her husband\\'s name by permission of the\\r\\ncourt, uses her maiden name on her cards, with the prefix Mrs. If she\\r\\nretains her husband\\'s name, she usually combines her family name with it,\\r\\nas Mrs. Jones Brown.\\r\\n\\r\\nA card should never be handed to a hostess or any member of the family.\\r\\nLay it on the table. If a member of the family opens the door, a card need\\r\\nnot be used, though one is often left as above.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt afternoon teas, receptions and \"At Homes\" the visitor leaves a card for\\r\\nthe hostess on the tray in the hall, and one for the guest of honor, or\\r\\nthe debutante if one is being introduced.\\r\\n\\r\\nA card to an \"At Home\" or an afternoon reception does not require either\\r\\nacceptance or regret. If the person invited attends she leaves her card;\\r\\nif not, she sends it by mail to reach the home on the day of the\\r\\nreception.\\r\\n\\r\\n[784 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nAn invitation to a dinner must be answered immediately, and\\r\\nunconditionally accepted or declined.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf, having accepted, it becomes absolutely impossible to keep the\\r\\nengagement, the earliest possible notice must be given to the hostess.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is unpardonable to be late at a dinner party. Arrivals are expected\\r\\nwithin ten minutes of the hour named.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne wears the best she has that is suitable for a dinner party.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe reply to an invitation must follow the style of the invitation. If\\r\\nformal, that is, in the third person, the reply must also be in the third\\r\\nperson. If informal, the personal form being employed, the reply is also\\r\\ninformal.\\r\\n\\r\\nDo not send your card with \"Regrets\" written upon it, in response to any\\r\\ninvitation, formal or informal.\\r\\n\\r\\nTelephone invitations are admissible only for informal affairs. General\\r\\ninvitations, given verbally, have no social footing. \"Do come and dine\\r\\nwith us some day,\" unless followed by a definite date or note of\\r\\ninvitation, means nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn invitation given by a man to dine or visit, or to a home entertainment,\\r\\nis not to be accepted unless seconded by his wife.\\r\\n\\r\\nA girl, sending invitations to commencement exercises, encloses her card.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is bad form to show that one feels slighted or affronted at not having\\r\\nbeen invited to any function, or not given the precedence one feels\\r\\nherself entitles to. The hostess, in her own home, obeys such rules as she\\r\\nbelieves correct.\\r\\n\\r\\nA visitor is expected to contribute her share to the pleasure of the\\r\\noccasion by being conversationally agreeable.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf hostess, one must overlook every awkwardness on the part of the guest\\r\\nor servant, and any accident to one\\'s belongings, but be deeply solicitous\\r\\nand apologetic if an accident happens to a guest,\\r\\n\\r\\nThe guest of honor at a dinner party should take leave first. Other\\r\\ndepartures follow speedily.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRemember--\\r\\n\\r\\nThat an invitation to spend a few days with a friend requires a speedy\\r\\nreply. It is not allowable to say one will come either earlier or later\\r\\nthan the time specified.\\r\\n\\r\\nA visitor should adapt herself to the ways of the household, be punctual\\r\\nat meals, and make no plans or arrangements without consulting her\\r\\nhostess.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe may not invite a friend of her own to a meal without requesting\\r\\npermission of her hostess.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe should be careful not to infringe upon the privileges and prerogatives\\r\\nof the man of the house.\\r\\n\\r\\n      MANNERS AND SOCIAL CUSTOMS       785\\r\\n\\r\\nShe may accept invitations in which the hostess is not included, but never\\r\\nwithout due consultation with her hostess.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe should show herself pleased with the efforts made to entertain her and\\r\\nenter into them readily.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe should leave promptly at the expiration of the time set for her visit.\\r\\nIt is almost invariably a mistake to outstay the limit. If no limit was\\r\\nnamed in the invitation, she should, within a day or two of her arrival,\\r\\nstate the date on which she will leave.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn her return home, her first duty is to write her hostess, announcing her\\r\\narrival and expressing her pleasure in the visit. To omit this is a grave\\r\\ndiscourtesy. A hostess once said of a woman who failed in this particular:\\r\\n\"We don\\'t know whether she reached home or not; we never heard from her\\r\\nafter she left.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOn departure, maids or servants who have attended one should receive a\\r\\ngratuity, proportioned to the means of the visitor and the style of the\\r\\nestablishment.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hostess should arrange to have the visitor met, either meeting her in\\r\\nperson at the station or being first to greet her on her arrival at the\\r\\nhouse.\\r\\n\\r\\nGuest rooms should be in perfect order and equipped with every possible\\r\\nconvenience for the comfort of visitors.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hostess arranges whatever pleasures are possible for her guest\\'s\\r\\nenjoyment, invites her friends to call on her, and probably gives a tea or\\r\\nreception in her honor.\\r\\n\\r\\nDo not forget that it is ill-bred as well as unkind to discuss the family\\r\\naffairs of one\\'s hostess with others; to criticise or complain of her\\r\\narrangements; or gossip about her or her family.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRemember--\\r\\n\\r\\nThe announcement of an engagement comes from the family of the girl.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe parents and relatives of the bridegroom-elect should call on the girl\\r\\nand her mother, or if living in another city write cordial letters without\\r\\ndelay.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bride-elect should respond to these advances with cordiality.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe should try to make her future husband\\'s family like her.\\r\\n\\r\\nEtiquette is not relaxed in the case of an engaged couple. They do not\\r\\nmake calls together except on relatives or very close friends. They may\\r\\nnot make journeys together unchaperoned.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cost of a wedding, whether at church or at home, is borne by the\\r\\nbride\\'s family, the bridegroom paying for the wedding ring, the\\r\\nclergyman\\'s fee, and the carriage in which the pair leave the church after\\r\\nthe ceremony.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough it may be necessary to limit the number of invitations to a\\r\\nwedding, announcement cards should be sent to all the friends and\\r\\nacquaintances of the two families.\\r\\n\\r\\n[786 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe \"giving away\" of a bride by her father is no mere form; it is a\\r\\nrecognition of family authority, the claim of a father upon his daughter.\\r\\nIt should therefore be a part of the ceremony.\\r\\n\\r\\nInvitations to the church ceremony do not necessitate a wedding gift.\\r\\nThose invited to the reception may send gifts if they so desire.\\r\\n\\r\\nCards are usually removed from gifts, but in some cases are left on.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll gifts should be acknowledged before the ceremony if possible, by the\\r\\nbride herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the bridegroom\\'s parents live out of town, it is customary for the\\r\\nparents of the bride to invite them to their home as guests of the\\r\\noccasion. If this is not practicable, they may engage rooms for them at a\\r\\nhotel, paying the bill in advance.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is thought unlucky to postpone a wedding. Better withdraw the\\r\\ninvitations in case of severe illness or death, and have a quiet home\\r\\nceremony with few present.\\r\\n\\r\\nA bridal procession always moves up the central aisle of the church. In\\r\\ncase there is no center aisle, it moves up one aisle and retires down the\\r\\nother. The relatives of the bridegroom are seated in the body of the\\r\\nchurch on the right; those of the bride are similarly placed on the left.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hats of the father and ushers are left with the sexton in the\\r\\nvestibule and handed to them as they leave.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt a church wedding a bride almost invariably wears a veil. Her attendants\\r\\nwear hats. The maid-of-honor may wear a short veil.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dress of the bridal party has already been fully described in a\\r\\npreceding chapter.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is the custom for the bridegroom to give a gift, almost invariably a\\r\\npiece of jewelry, to his bride; and a small gift of silver or jewelry to\\r\\neach of the ushers and to the best man. The bride generally gives some\\r\\nsouvenir of the same character to each of her attendants.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bridegroom sends the bride her bouquet, and often one of violets or\\r\\nher favorite flower to the bride\\'s mother.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bride\\'s father seems a rather subordinate figure at the fashionable\\r\\nwedding. After he has given away the bride, he retires into the\\r\\nbackground, escorting his wife to her carriage at the conclusion of the\\r\\nceremony. He does not assist her in receiving the guests at the house, but\\r\\ncirculates among them after congratulations have been tendered the newly\\r\\nwedded pair.\\r\\n\\r\\nFormal afternoon dress is necessary for men who attend a day wedding, at\\r\\nchurch or at home. At an evening wedding they wear evening clothes.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a wedding, the members of the bridal party are expected to call on\\r\\nthe bride\\'s mother within ten days or two weeks.\\r\\n\\r\\n[MANNERS AND SOCIAL CUSTOMS 787]\\r\\n\\r\\nA bridal party always stand with their backs to the audience, the\\r\\nclergyman facing it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRemember--\\r\\n\\r\\nThat men\\'s evening clothes are not worn before six o\\'clock.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat women wear their hats at afternoon functions, teas, luncheons, bridge\\r\\nparties, etc., and remove them at evening affairs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat in society, personal affairs, servants, dress, household\\r\\ndifficulties, \"symptoms,\" illnesses and bereavements, are not to be made a\\r\\nsubject of conversation.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is not good form to talk of the cost of articles or mention money\\r\\naffairs in company.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe social aspirant should cultivate the art of saying polite nothings\\r\\nacceptably.

Though she have none,\\r\\nshe yet persuadeth herself that she possesses some charm upon which men\\'s\\r\\neyes rest admiringly.\"--Johnson.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There is no wound a woman will not more willingly forget than a blow to\\r\\nher vanity.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough woman\\'s chief desire is to be beautiful, it is a historical fact\\r\\nthat nearly every woman whose beauty has been renowned has either led an\\r\\nunhappy life or met a tragic fate. Strangely, too, the most famous\\r\\nattachments of which we have record have been inspired by women who were\\r\\nnot only not beautiful, but who had some noticeable defect. So to be\\r\\nattractive, and to charm, it is not necessary to be beautiful. Beauty\\r\\ngives a woman a start in the race; her other qualities must enable her to\\r\\nkeep her advantage.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE FACE-HEALTH AS AN AID TO BEAUTY.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first essential to good looks is good health. The clear complexion,\\r\\nthe bright eyes, the lustrous hair that are such helps are born of good\\r\\nhealth rather than of creams and hair tonics. Health depends a good deal\\r\\non wholesome diet and out-door exercise, which make pure blood. Pure air\\r\\nis invaluable. Country girls often have exquisite complexions because of\\r\\nthe pure air they breathe--unless they eat too much heavy, greasy food.\\r\\n\\r\\nStudy hygiene, then, instead of relying upon \"Bloom of Youth\" and \"Cream\\r\\nof Roses\" as aids to a good complexion. Such things deceive no one, and by\\r\\nuse ruin the skin, wrinkling and withering it. It is a good thing to drink\\r\\nplenty of water. A glass on retiring, another on rising, and a third an\\r\\nhour before the noon meal is little enough. Keep the stomach and bowels in\\r\\ngood order.\\r\\n\\r\\nBLACKHEADS.--The most frequent inquiry in the \"beauty pages\" of the papers\\r\\nis what to do for blackheads. In the first place, don\\'t allow yourself to\\r\\nget them. Keep your face clean. A blackhead is simply a pore that is\\r\\nfilled with oil and dirt. Sometimes they are as large as the head of a\\r\\npin. When taken out they leave an enlargement known as a coarse pore. Do\\r\\nnot steam the face to remove them. Wash the face well with soap and hot\\r\\nwater; wring cloths out of hot water and hold to the face then massage\\r\\nwith cold cream. Several treatments will soften them so they may be\\r\\npinched out between the thumbs. Never attempt this treatment before going\\r\\nout; do it at night, before retiring.\\r\\n\\r\\nBlackheads are a reflection upon one\\'s personal cleanliness, therefore\\r\\nbathe the whole body often.\\r\\n\\r\\n[BEAUTY AND THE TOILET 791]\\r\\n\\r\\nPIMPLES.--Pimples are due to an impure condition of the blood, for which\\r\\nsulphur is a good remedy, taken internally and applied externally. One\\r\\ndram each of camphor and flowers of sulphur in four ounces of rose-water\\r\\nis a good lotion for external use. Do not pick or squeeze pimples, unless\\r\\npus has formed in them. Nothing is more disgusting than a face broken out\\r\\nin pus-filled pimples. See a physician if thus afflicted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFRECKLES.--These have been poetically called \"the kisses of the sun,\" but\\r\\nno girl cares for evidences of that sort of affection. Prevention is\\r\\neasier than cure. Simple home remedies are lemon juice and glycerin, sour\\r\\nbuttermilk, and elderflower soap used in bathing.\\r\\n\\r\\nA well-known application is six grains of bichloride of mercury in one\\r\\nounce each of glycerin and alcohol, and a few drops, say ten or twelve, of\\r\\noil of lavender. The trouble is that after using these remedies the skin\\r\\nis delicate and freckles more easily.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fad for going bareheaded has ruined many a girl\\'s complexion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSUNBURN.--Avoid it when possible. If going on the water, apply magnesia to\\r\\nthe face rather thickly. If sunburned, rub the skin with cold cream,\\r\\nleaving it on as long as you can before using water on it. A wash that is\\r\\ngood for tan and sunburn requires half an ounce of borax and an ounce of\\r\\nlemon juice in a pint of rose water.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPPED HANDS AND FACE.--Many cases of \"chaps\" may be avoided by the\\r\\nsimple precaution of wiping the face and hands perfectly dry. If the skin\\r\\nchaps easily keep at hand a bottle of glycerin and lemon juice mixed in\\r\\nabout equal proportions, and after wiping rub a little on the hands.\\r\\nBefore going out in the cold, rub a little cold cream or oil of sweet\\r\\nalmonds over the face; leave it on a few minutes, rub off lightly with a\\r\\ndry towel and dust with rice powder. Camphor ice is good for chapped lips.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA PURE FACE CREAM.--Set a bowl in a basin of hot water over the fire. In\\r\\nit put a quarter of an ounce of white wax and two and a half ounces of\\r\\nspermaceti, and the same quantity of oil of sweet almonds. When melted and\\r\\nhot, add a pinch of borax and an ounce and a half of rose-water. Beat\\r\\nthese ingredients with a silver fork, briskly, till the cream is cold.\\r\\nWarm the jar before filling it and keep in a cool place.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nANOTHER GOOD CREAM.--One ounce each of white wax and spermaceti; two\\r\\nounces each of lanolin and cocoanut oil and four ounces of sweet almond\\r\\noil. Melt in a double-boiler or a bowl set in hot water, and stir in two\\r\\nounces of orange flower water and thirty drops of tincture of benzoin.\\r\\nStir briskly till cold, and of the consistency of a thick paste. This is\\r\\nto be used at night, after thoroughly washing the face. It is a good\\r\\ncleansing cream also.\\r\\n\\r\\n[792 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nWRINKLES.--It is a great deal easier to prevent wrinkles than it is to get\\r\\nrid of them after one has acquired them. A little study of women\\'s faces\\r\\nwill show how wrinkles, that no amount of massage will obliterate, are\\r\\nbeing made. They make perpendicular wrinkles between the eyes by drawing\\r\\nthe brows together when sewing or reading, sometimes through habit and\\r\\nsometimes because of insufficient light. Some wrinkles are born of\\r\\nin-temper, of fretfulness, or sorrow. As the skin loses its elasticity,\\r\\nthrough age or ill-health, wrinkles come more and more easily. The best\\r\\nremedy for wrinkles is a light heart and a contented mind. Assist these\\r\\nwith good, wholesome food that makes pure blood to feed the body, and\\r\\nrender external aid through gentle massage and some good face cream and\\r\\nyou have done the best you can. It is a good plan to some day take your\\r\\nhand-mirror with you as you go about your daily duties and watch the\\r\\nprocess of wrinkle-making. Say you are sewing and note the glass. Without\\r\\nchanging your expression, take a look at yourself. The chance is it will\\r\\nbe a revelation. You will realize why wrinkles come.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMASSAGE.--Unless properly done, massage may do more harm than good. If one\\r\\ncan afford a few treatments by a scientific masseur and study her methods,\\r\\nit is a great help. The thing is not to rub in more than you rub out, by\\r\\nimproper manipulation. Rub the face up, not down. This is because of the\\r\\ntendency of the muscles to sag.\\r\\n\\r\\nRub across, not with, the lines. Rub the \"parentheses\" around the month up\\r\\nand out, and give a rotary motion to the rubs given the checks, gently\\r\\npinching and pulling them out.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut after all, there\\'s nothing like good temper and steady nerves to\\r\\nprevent the tell-tale lines.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWRINKLED HANDS.--Wrinkled hands belong to age, and are due to loss of oil\\r\\nin the skin. After washing and wiping them, rub with a little cold cream\\r\\nor olive oil. Rub well into the skin. At night, use the cream or oil\\r\\nfreely and put on a pair of old gloves.\\r\\n\\r\\nCamphor is a good whitening agent for the hands, and a teaspoonful of\\r\\nspirits of camphor beaten into any greasy, cold cream will be beneficial.\\r\\nA piece of the gum camphor melted with the ointment blends more readily. A\\r\\npiece of camphor size of a walnut to two tablespoonfuls of the cream is\\r\\nabout right proportions.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRED HANDS AND NOSE.--Sometimes a too tight corset, impeding the\\r\\ncirculation of the blood, is responsible for the blemishes; sometimes poor\\r\\ncirculation due to poor health. Cold feet may send the blood to the nose.\\r\\nFind out what is the cause and remove it. Local applications are\\r\\nineffective.\\r\\n\\r\\n[BEAUTY AND THE TOILET 793]\\r\\n\\r\\nCOLD OR FEVER SORES.--These unpleasant afflictions may be cured if taken\\r\\nat the first indication of what is coming--a smarting or burning\\r\\nsensation--by frequent applications of dilute spirits of camphor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFACE POWDERS.--There are few women who do not at times have occasion to\\r\\nuse face powder. A woman once remarked: \"It isn\\'t decent not to in\\r\\nsummer--one looks so greasy without.\" There are many face powders on the\\r\\nmarket, some of which are comparatively harmless, while others are\\r\\ndeleterious. The injury done by powder is that it fills the pores,\\r\\nstopping them up and thus clogging the skin. Many powders contain lead or\\r\\nbismuth, both of which are very injurious. Magnesia is drying. Rice powder\\r\\nis most harmless, but does not adhere. The most innocent powder is\\r\\nprobably a preparation of French chalk. Weigh a box of powder in your hand\\r\\nbefore purchasing. If heavy, it doubtless contains lead, and should be\\r\\nrefused. Find some powder that agrees with your skin and then buy that\\r\\nbrand. Suit the color of the powder to your complexion. Don\\'t use flesh\\r\\ntint if you are sallow, the \"outlying regions\" of neck and ears betray\\r\\nyou.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTO USE POWDER.--Wash the face; rub a little cold cream over it, rubbing it\\r\\nin well, wipe with a dry towel, gently, then apply the powder with a\\r\\nchamois--a clean one. Do not keep it on unnecessarily. Remove by rubbing\\r\\nwith the cleansing cream, then wash the face. Never go to bed with powder\\r\\non your face.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLIQUID WHITENERS.--Avoid these. They are \"whitewashes\" that wither and\\r\\nwrinkle the skin and make it prematurely old. Almost without exception\\r\\nthey contain lead in some form. Constant use may produce a facial\\r\\nparalysis due to lead poisoning. Moreover they deceive no one, and give an\\r\\nunpleasing impression as regards one\\'s good sense.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nROUGE.--Well, don\\'t do it. There may be a few who can have a rouge\\r\\nespecially prepared that is the exact tint that harmonizes with the skin,\\r\\nthe hair, the eyes, and can apply it so carefully as to look \"natural.\"\\r\\nBut ordinarily the deception is evident, and rouge in conjunction with\\r\\nliquid washes and penciled eyes and brows, suggest the aids employed by\\r\\nwomen of the demi-monde.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf any rouge is used, let it be the \"Spanish lady\\'s rouge\" or\\r\\ncrepons--bits of white woolen crepe dyed with an ammoniacal solution of\\r\\ncarmine. These are gently rubbed on the skin to produce the required glow.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE HAIR.--Beautiful hair is woman\\'s crown of glory. Thousands of the sex\\r\\nwear it unbecomingly. They follow the latest fashion in arrangement\\r\\nwithout reference to whether it suits the lines of the face and head or\\r\\notherwise. One should never be satisfied with a front view alone. Study\\r\\nthe back, the sides, the lines produced, just as you study the\\r\\nbecomingness of a hat from all angles. If a new fashion is unbecoming,\\r\\neither avoid it, or modify it into becomingness if you can. So many women\\r\\nmake guys of themselves by a slavish devotion to the freaks of fashion.\\r\\n\\r\\n[794 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nCARE OF THE HAIR.--The hair is kept in order by frequent brushings, which\\r\\nexcite the natural oil by which it is fed, and by washing it. Dr. Leonard,\\r\\nan authority on the hair, says once a month is as often as the hair needs\\r\\nwashing. As a shampoo, he advises yolk of egg, well rubbed into the scalp\\r\\nand roots of the hair, then washed out with tepid water and castile soap.\\r\\nA brisk rubbing with dry towels excites the blood-vessels of the scalp.\\r\\nThere is no doubt that this simple shampoo is more beneficial than many\\r\\nnew-fangled ones.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hair should be taken down and well brushed every night, This removes\\r\\ndirt and makes it glossy. Use a brush with bristles as stiff as you can\\r\\nuse without irritating the scalp too much, and keep it clean. Don\\'t drag a\\r\\nfine comb through the hair. The proper comb has regular and even teeth,\\r\\nrounded, not sharp. If a tooth becomes split, remove it; it will break the\\r\\nhair. Wire brushes are nothing more or less than combs, and are not as\\r\\ngood for the hair as good bristle brushes. Keep combs and brushes clean.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nUSE OF POMADES.--Hair that is dry and brittle really requires some\\r\\noleaginous preparation, used in moderation. Yellow vaselin is good. Part\\r\\nthe hair and rub it into the scalp with the tips of the fingers. A\\r\\nsufficient amount will find its way to the hair itself to relieve the\\r\\ndryness. Cocoanut oil is also good. Never apply anything of this kind to\\r\\nthe hair itself, which is simply made greasy. The benefit should be to the\\r\\nroots. The application of vaselin may be made a couple of days before the\\r\\nmonthly washing, or if the hair is very dry, may follow it. Remember not\\r\\nto overdo the matter. It does not follow that because a little is good,\\r\\nmore is better.\\r\\n\\r\\nA specialist on the hair who makes biennial trips abroad to advise himself\\r\\nas to the most recent methods and treatment, in a moment of confidence\\r\\nadmitted to a customer that after all pure cold water was as good a hair\\r\\ntonic as he knew of. \"Do not wet the hair.\" he said. \"Dip the tips of your\\r\\nfingers in cold water and rub the scalp, wetting it and at the same time\\r\\nmassaging it. Do this as faithfully as you would apply a tonic, and in all\\r\\nbut certain exceptional cases it will be as beneficial.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCLIPPING THE HAIR.--It is a good plan to clip the ends of the hair once a\\r\\nmonth to keep the growth even. If the hair splits, trim to a point above\\r\\nit, as the tendency is for the split to extend further up the hair-shaft.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDANDRUFF.--Dandruff is the scaling off of dead cuticle. In excess, it\\r\\nbecomes a disease, forming so thick a scale as to kill the roots of the\\r\\nhair and cause it to fall out. It is rightly called \"itch dirt.\"\\r\\nCleanliness therefore helps a cure.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn old-fashioned recipe for dandruff calls for five ounces of bay rum, one\\r\\nounce of olive oil, one ounce tincture of cantharides. Dr. Leonard advises\\r\\nfree applications of sweet oil for the purpose of softening the scales,\\r\\nthen a washing with warm water and castile soap, or the \"green soap\" of\\r\\nthe pharmacy. If the disease is bad, or obstinate, apply a little oxide of\\r\\nzinc ointment.\\r\\n\\r\\n[BEAUTY AND THE TOILET 795]\\r\\n\\r\\nWASHING THE HAIR.--One suspects that those who advise washing the hair\\r\\nonce a week have more of all eye to the increase of their business than to\\r\\nthe welfare of their customers\\' hair. The egg shampoo has been advised.\\r\\nUse a soap made of vegetable oil if possible. Never rub soap in the hair,\\r\\nand be very careful to rinse thoroughly, to get all the soap out using hot\\r\\nwater for washing, then graduating the temperature till the final douche\\r\\nof cold. Do not use ammonia, soda or borax on the hair.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCOLOR OF THE HAIR.--Nature has suited the hair to the complexion in every\\r\\ncase, and we cannot improve upon her idea of harmony. That is why any\\r\\nattempt to change the color is so unsatisfactory. The \"bleached blonde\" is\\r\\nalways recognizable; so is the woman who dyes her faded locks in vain\\r\\neffort to retain her \"youth.\" As the hair changes by natural processes the\\r\\ncomplexion changes to match it, so that we never get a chance to improve\\r\\nupon nature\\'s handiwork.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Elizabethan days, wigs were worn to harmonize or match with the\\r\\ncostume. Queen Elizabeth had over eighty. Think of purple hair? Yet some\\r\\ndyes give a purple tinge to the locks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDYED HAIR.--Dyed hair is a sorry makeshift at best. Far better let nature\\r\\nhave her way. There is but one hair-dye that is not positively harmful,\\r\\nthis is henna, and its use entails no end of trouble because it must be\\r\\nfrequently renewed,--some use it every day.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo prepare the dye, get a quarter pound of henna leaves; to this add two\\r\\nquarts of cold water. Let stand on the back of the range where it will\\r\\nsteep slowly for four or five hours. Add three ounces of alcohol and\\r\\nbottle. Apply with a tooth-brush. It gives a sort of reddish-brown color.\\r\\nWomen whose hair is prematurely gray often use this, declaring their white\\r\\nhair prevents them from obtaining or holding business positions. But where\\r\\nhair has whitened prematurely there is always a freshness and vitality\\r\\nabout eyes and complexion that bespeaks youth.\\r\\n\\r\\nPhysicians strongly deprecate the use of hair dyes. No matter how\\r\\nstrenuously the label insists on \"absolute harmlessness,\" the dye relies\\r\\nfor its effectiveness upon the presence of lead in some chemical\\r\\ncombination. The frequent application of lead to the scalp induces a\\r\\ncertain dangerous form of poisoning, which results in paralysis. If \"dye\\r\\nyou must,\" pin your faith to henna.\\r\\n\\r\\n[796 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nGRAY HAIR.--\"The only thing to do with gray hair is to admire it.\" This is\\r\\ntrue. Nothing so sets off an aged face like the crown of silver. To color\\r\\nit is a great mistake. There is absolutely no cure for it; the one thing\\r\\nwe can do is to make it a beauty. Gray hair is due to the exhaustion of\\r\\nthe pigment or coloring cells of the hair, supposed to be occasioned by\\r\\nthe lack of a regular supply of blood.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the progressive whitening of the hair due to the advance of age,\\r\\ncurative agents are rarely of any avail, especially if the trouble is\\r\\nhereditary. Not that gray hair and baldness are handed down from father to\\r\\nson, but that the peculiarities of constitution which produce them are\\r\\ninherent in both. Nervousness, neuralgia, a low physical condition, aid\\r\\nthe falling and blanching of the hair, and the victim should build up the\\r\\ngeneral system. Preparations of iron and sulphur, taken internally, are\\r\\nsupposed to supply certain elements of growth and pigment-forming power to\\r\\nthe hair.\\r\\n\\r\\nA solution of iron for external application to the hair, calls for two\\r\\ndrams each of citrate of iron and tincture of nux vomica, and one and\\r\\none-half ounces each of cocoanut oil and bay rum. It may be mentioned\\r\\nhere, that faithfulness in treatment means even more than the tonic\\r\\napplied. To gain any real benefit, one must be persistent in application.\\r\\n\\r\\nHair often turns gray \"in streaks\" to the chagrin of the victim. Or it\\r\\nwhitens above the forehead and temples and remains dark at the back.\\r\\nNothing can be done for this.\\r\\n\\r\\nGray hair should be kept scrupulously clean, and requires more frequent\\r\\nwashing than hair that holds its color. A very little blueing in the\\r\\nrinsing water gives a purer, clearer white. For this use indigo, not the\\r\\nusual washing fluid which is made of Prussian blue. Five cents worth of\\r\\nindigo will last a lifetime.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA HAIR TONIC.--A lotion Dr. Leonard recommends for the hair, especially\\r\\nwhere it is coming out calls for two drams tincture cantharides, half an\\r\\nounce nux vomica, one dram tincture capsicum, one and a half ounces castor\\r\\noil, and two ounces of cologne. Apply with a bit of sponge twice a day.\\r\\n\\r\\nA preparation which is tonic in its properties and is also said to darken\\r\\ngray hair, and which certainly contains nothing injurious, calls for one\\r\\nounce of sage and a pint of boiling water, allowed to stand twenty-four\\r\\nhours in an iron pot, and then filtered through filtering papers.\\r\\n\\r\\nDigest half an ounce of pine tar in a pint of water for forty-eight hours,\\r\\nstirring occasionally; filter, and put with the other fluid, then add one\\r\\npint of bay rum, one ounce each of cologne and tincture of cantharides,\\r\\ntwo ounces of glycerin and ten ounces of distilled water. Apply daily,\\r\\nusing a tonic brush.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE HAIR AND HEALTH.--The condition of the hair is largely predicated on\\r\\nthe condition of the general health. In health, it should be abundant,\\r\\nglossy and bright--\"live\"--in color. A low physical condition may make it\\r\\nlook dry and dead, and induce falling out. Take care of the general health\\r\\nfor the sake of the hair as well as for the sake of the complexion.\\r\\n\\r\\n[BEAUTY AND THE TOILET 797]\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE HANDS.--One of the woman\\'s continuous tasks is trying to keep her\\r\\nhands clean, and one thing that militates against their good looks is\\r\\ncareless washing. They are washed indiscriminately in hot or cold water,\\r\\nthe soap not properly rinsed off, nor the drying complete. To keep them\\r\\nsoft and white, wash in soft, tepid water, dry thoroughly, then rub in a\\r\\nlittle cold cream or compound of glycerin, or fine cornmeal. Use rubber\\r\\ngloves in dish washing, and if you must have your hands in soapy water for\\r\\na long time, after washing them in pure water rub over with a few drops of\\r\\nlemon juice or cider vinegar. This kills the potash in the soap that has\\r\\nbeen used.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCARE OF THE NAILS.--It is a luxury to have one\\'s nails done by a manicure,\\r\\nand if one can not afford this, always, it is profitable to have it done a\\r\\nfew times and carefully observe the process, because the nails are a very\\r\\nimportant part of the care of the hands.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinger Nail Powder, Old Tried Remedy for--\\r\\n\\r\\n    \"Violet Talcum Powder     1/2 ounce\\r\\n    Pulverized Boric Acid     1/2 ounce\\r\\n    Powdered Starch           1/2 ounce\\r\\n    Tincture of Carmine        15 drops\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the nails become hard or brittle, immerse them in warm olive oil every\\r\\nnight or rub vaselin into them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIMPLEMENTS.--The tools required are a pair of manicure scissors, which\\r\\nhave small curved blades; get a good pair of steel scissors, the silver\\r\\nare not so good; a package of emery boards, an orange-wood stick, a\\r\\nflexible nail file, a small bottle of peroxide of hydrogen for bleaching,\\r\\na bit of pumice stone, a cake of polishing powder, a chamois covered\\r\\n\"buffer\" and a box of rosaline or other paste.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PROCESS.--The nails are to be shortened by filing, as cutting thickens\\r\\nthem. The orange-wood stick is then dipped in peroxide and run under the\\r\\nnail to bleach, then the pumice stone, powdered, is used in the same way\\r\\nto cleanse. During this the left hand is soaking in tepid, soapy water. Of\\r\\ncourse, if you do your own manicuring you will go on with the right hand,\\r\\nwaiting while the cuticle at the base of the nail softens. This is then\\r\\nanointed with a little cold cream or vaselin; the cuticle is loosened and\\r\\ntrimmed if necessary,--do not trim if you can avoid it, as cutting\\r\\nthickens it. When both hands have been thus treated, they are again soaked\\r\\na few minutes, then a little of the rosaline paste--a very little--is put\\r\\non each nail, the buffer dipped in the polishing powder and the nails\\r\\npolished. The hands are then washed, rubbed dry, and the fingers gone over\\r\\na second time in search of roughness of nail or cuticle; they are then\\r\\npolished again with a clean buffer, and may be sprayed with perfume from\\r\\nan atomizer.\\r\\n\\r\\nMOUTH AND TEETH.--Many young people owe their homely mouths to infantile\\r\\nhabits. Sucking the thumb, and these horrible \"pacificators\" or \"baby\\r\\ncomforters\" are responsible for some ill-shaped mouths. A large mouth, if\\r\\nnot malformed, is not ugly unless filled with bad teeth or set in a\\r\\ndisagreeable expression. Thus, in a way, we mould this feature ourselves,\\r\\nto a considerable degree.\\r\\n\\r\\n[798 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nCLEANSING THE TEETH.--A good brushing twice a day, using cold water and\\r\\nsome pleasant antiseptic wash, like listerine, does much to keep the mouth\\r\\nand teeth clean. Particles of food lodged between the teeth should be\\r\\nremoved with a bit of dental floss.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nVISITS TO THE DENTIST.--Pain and expense are saved by consulting the\\r\\ndentist in good season. The smallest cavity should be filled as soon as\\r\\ndiscovered. At least once a year the teeth should be carefully examined by\\r\\none\\'s dentist; it would be better to go every six months. Let the dentist\\r\\nclean them and remove the tartar, if any, as commercial preparations often\\r\\ninjure. Most dentists will save a tooth wherever possible. There is little\\r\\nexcuse for bad teeth these days, since modern dentistry can work marvels.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHILDREN\\'S TEETH.--On no account let a child\\'s second teeth come in\\r\\ncrowded, irregular or projecting. A good dentist can remedy all these\\r\\nmalformations and though it may be troublesome at the time, the child,\\r\\nwhen grown, will blame you for not having relieved him of them. From\\r\\nbabyhood, the child should be taught that cleansing the teeth is as\\r\\nimportant a part of the toilet as washing the hands.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE EYES.--No gift is more precious than sight. Therefore take care of\\r\\nyour eyes. Don\\'t overstrain them, don\\'t put anything in them, don\\'t follow\\r\\nany casual prescription, nor use belladonna to brighten them. Consult an\\r\\noculist, not an optician, if there is anything the matter with them. Bathe\\r\\nthem in hot water when they feel tired and drawn. Eyesight is too precious\\r\\nto be tampered with. If a child is cross-eyed, a simple operation will\\r\\nstraighten them, and it is a crime not to have it done.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEYELASHES AND EYEBROWS.--The best application for these is the simplest.\\r\\nJust a little yellow vaselin, which encourages growth. Don\\'t clip, either.\\r\\nFrequent brushing will generally train the brows into a shapely line. A\\r\\nheavy, coarse hair may be pulled out with the fingers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE FEET.--The three most frequent evils to which the feet are heir are\\r\\ncorns, bunions or enlarged joints, and chilblains. Ingrowing nails are\\r\\nmuch less common, but make up in painfulness.\\r\\n\\r\\nCORNS.--Corns are of three kinds: callous spots, soft corns, and corns.\\r\\nCallous spots may be rubbed or pared down and rubbed with cocoa butter.\\r\\nSoft corns come between the toes and are very painful. Soak absorbent\\r\\ncotton in a little turpentine and put between the toes; or sprinkle the\\r\\ncotton with powdered alum. These corns are supposed to be due to moisture\\r\\nbetween the toes and are sometimes cured and often prevented by keeping\\r\\nabsorbent cotton between the toes. Prevention saves a lot of suffering.\\r\\n\"Just corns\" are calloused spots with hard center; pressure on this causes\\r\\npain. Soaking in hot water, and shaving off as much of the hardened skin\\r\\nas can be removed with safety, affords relief. The little hard core should\\r\\nbe taken out.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrecautions.--Be sure that your knife, razor, or whatever implement is\\r\\nused is perfectly clean (sterilized) and avoid drawing blood. If this\\r\\nhappens, use some antiseptic. Cases of blood-poisoning that have resulted\\r\\nfatally have been caused by such wounds. If you wear colored hose, have\\r\\nthem washed before wearing, as the dye may be injurious.\\r\\n\\r\\n[BEAUTY AND THE TOILET 799]\\r\\n\\r\\nBUNIONS.--These painful enlargements are due to a too short shoe, or one\\r\\nthat does not fit well. Better discard such footwear; it will be cheaper\\r\\nin the end. Paint the sore joint with a mixture of equal parts of\\r\\nglycerin, tincture of iodine and carbolic acid; using a camel\\'s hair\\r\\nbrush. Stockings that are too short may produce the same affliction.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHILBLAINS.--People who have, or do not want chilblains should avoid\\r\\nwoolen stockings. Neither should they \"toast their toes\" at the fire, wear\\r\\nbed-socks, or take a hot water-bottle to bed with them. Warm the feet by\\r\\nexercise, or vigorous rubbing. If very painful, try ice-cold applications,\\r\\ntincture of iodine, camphor, and tincture of chloride of iron are healing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nINGROWING NAILS.--A bad case should be taken to the chiropodist. Shaving\\r\\nthe nail thin on the top, or cutting a V-shaped piece out of it, tend to\\r\\nrelieve. Raise up the nail and put a bit of absorbent cotton under it. The\\r\\nbest way is to avoid foot troubles by wearing well fitting shoes which are\\r\\nsufficiently large.\\r\\n\\r\\n[800 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nNURSERY HINTS AND FIRESIDE GEMS\\r\\n\\r\\nFor Mother and Her Little Family\\r\\n\\r\\nTEN COMMANDMENTS FOR RAISING CHILDREN.\\r\\n\\r\\n1.

The hours are\\r\\nlong and holidays and vacations are few and far between. Mother gets a\\r\\ngreat deal of maudlin sympathy and not enough tangible aid, says a writer\\r\\nin the Housekeeper. Our poetic conception of the true mother is that her\\r\\nwhole life is bound up in the welfare of her children and her family. At\\r\\nwhat age are her children not, for her, a matter of serious concern? She\\r\\nhas ever had plenty of material which she can manufacture into worry and\\r\\nheartaches.

The buttercup, which is harmless enough\\r\\nto handle, contains an acid poison that will produce sore mouth, and taken\\r\\ninto the stomach worse effects might result. It also contains a narcotic\\r\\nprinciple, anemonin, which has the property of diminishing the respiration\\r\\nand heart action.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFlowers.--It is with flowers as with moral qualities, the bright are\\r\\nsometimes poisonous, but I believe never the sweet.--Hare.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nReasoning versus Punishment.--There is one great point that all mothers\\r\\nshould observe and that is not to punish children when reasoning would\\r\\nbring the same results. For needless correction blunts a child\\'s\\r\\nsensitiveness. To state that it brutalizes him is putting it too\\r\\npositively, but it tends to develop indifference and hardness that one\\r\\ndoes not want a child to possess,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDiscipline.--Be ever gentle with the children God has given you.--Watch\\r\\nover them constantly; reprove them earnestly, but not in anger.--In the\\r\\nforcible language of Scripture, \"Be not bitter against them.\" \"Yes, they\\r\\nare good boys,\" said a kind father. \"I talk to them much, but I do not\\r\\nbeat my children: the world will beat them.\" It was a beautiful thought,\\r\\nthough not elegantly expressed.--Burritt.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBaby\\'s Kimono.--The little flannel kimonos or wrappers, so convenient to\\r\\nslip on the baby before the morning bath, or if the room is at all chilly,\\r\\nmay be made up in pretty styles, in delicate colors, bound with silk, and\\r\\ntied with tiny bows to match.\\r\\n\\r\\n[NURSERY HINTS AND FIRESIDE GEMS 803]\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly Schooling.--Of ten infants destined for different vocations, I\\r\\nshould prefer that the one who is to study through life should be the\\r\\nleast learned at the age of twelve.\\r\\n                                                          --Tissot.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBaby\\'s Fine Dresses.--If the baby\\'s dress is not made of the finest of\\r\\nhandkerchief linen, French nainsook or a very fine batiste is usually\\r\\nchosen. These are the soft materials, soft as well as sheer. They are the\\r\\nmaterials on which embroidery is done most successfully and the baby dress\\r\\nde luxe is always hand embroidered. It may have on it the merest touch of\\r\\nhand work--scarcely more than a few eyelets and a tiny blossom and stem\\r\\nand yet follow the prescribed lines.

The next to\\r\\nthe heaviest is quite warm enough for winter, and for summer the lightest\\r\\nweight obtainable, preferably of a mixture of silk and wool; cotton and\\r\\nwool should not be used. In hot weather shirts of cotton gauze or a soft\\r\\nporous cotton stockinet are satisfactory.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTraining.--The education of our children is never out of my mind. Train\\r\\nthem to virtue, habituate them to industry, activity, and spirit. Make\\r\\nthem consider every vice as shameful and unmanly. Fire them with ambition\\r\\nto be useful. Make them disdain to be destitute of any useful\\r\\nknowledge.--John Adams to his wife.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBaby\\'s Nerves.--Never try to entertain a baby too vigorously. Little\\r\\nbabies especially, but also children somewhat older, should never be\\r\\nsubjected to unnecessary excitement. Older people seldom realize how\\r\\nexceedingly undeveloped the nervous system of a little child is, and any\\r\\nundue shock to it is apt to cause the direst consequence. Do not take very\\r\\nsmall children to the theatre or the circus. They don\\'t understand it, and\\r\\nthey can\\'t enjoy it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIntemperance.--Violent excitement exhausts the mind, and leaves it\\r\\nwithered and sterile.--Fenelon.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSecond Teeth.--When the baby\\'s second teeth are cut there are often\\r\\ninjurious influences to be combated. There is more or less chance for the\\r\\nformation of caries or tartar; care must be taken and counsel sought, and\\r\\nevery effort made to prevent the aggravation of the evil.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTears.--Tears are the safety-valves of the heart when too much pressure is\\r\\nlaid on it.--Albert Smith.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGoing Barefoot.--The careful mother does not let her child run barefoot,\\r\\nno matter how they clamor to do it. If they wish to go shoeless, let them\\r\\nwear bathing sandals without stockings, is the advice of the writer, who\\r\\nadds, the germ of tetanus, better known as lockjaw, is frequently found in\\r\\nthe soil and a child with even a small scratch or cut takes big risks. For\\r\\ngirls, especially, running barefoot should be a forbidden pleasure as it\\r\\nmakes the feet broad and flat.\\r\\n\\r\\n[804 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFROM JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER\\'S \"BAREFOOT BOY.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n   Blessings on thee, little man,\\r\\n   Barefoot boy, with cheek of tan!\\r\\n   With thy turned-up pantaloons,\\r\\n   And thy merry whistled tunes;\\r\\n   With thy red lip, redder still\\r\\n   Kissed by strawberries on the hill;\\r\\n   With the sunshine on thy face,\\r\\n   Through thy torn brim\\'s jaunty grace;\\r\\n   From my heart I give thee joy,\\r\\n  I was once a barefoot boy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Children\\'s Sunday.--What can we do with the children on Sundays? Do\\r\\nnot attempt to do anything unusual or make yourself miserable over their\\r\\nnatural antics. Send them to the Sabbath School, never deny a child this\\r\\nprivilege or be too negligent to give him the privilege, says the Woman\\'s\\r\\nNational Daily. A walk during the day to the park, woods or some place\\r\\nwhere the recreation is pleasant, is advisable. But do not get so modern\\r\\nin your views that you will permit them the riotous amusements in which\\r\\nthey must usually indulge through the week. One cannot do wrong in\\r\\nimpressing the sacredness of the day upon the children, for it is one of\\r\\nthe deplorable features of modern life that the sacredness is sadly\\r\\nabused, and mostly by the young folk.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIdleness.--Idleness among children, as among men, is the root of all evil,\\r\\nand leads to no other evil more certain than ill-temper.--Hannah More.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLearning to Sew.--Every reasonable mother knows that it is wise to teach\\r\\nher little daughter to sew. Let her begin on the tiny garment of her doll.\\r\\nShe will easily form the habit of mending torn places in dolly\\'s clothes\\r\\nand replace absent buttons. With this experience, it will not be long\\r\\nbefore she will begin to take an interest in her own clothes, and so will\\r\\nnot need to be warned that a button is coming off or that the hem of her\\r\\nskirt is coming out. But, of course, she could not begin by sewing or\\r\\npatching her own clothes, nor by mending intricate tears. First see that\\r\\nshe sews on buttons correctly and then let her do some basting.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA Good Rule.--St. Edmund of Canterbury was right when he said to somebody.\\r\\n\"Work as though you would live forever; but live as though you would die\\r\\ntoday.\"\\r\\n                                                       --Henry Giles.\\r\\n\\r\\nDouble Duties.--Children should never be required to do housework to the\\r\\nextent a housekeeper must do it, for the strength of a growing child\\r\\nshould be applied almost wholly to duties at school. A growing child\\r\\ncannot do mental and hard physical labor at the same time. Wiping dishes\\r\\nand assisting in the dusting do not interfere with school work, and are\\r\\nreally good exercises. But the young girl who is compelled to rise early\\r\\nin the morning, prepare breakfast, assist with the family washing or\\r\\nironing and prepare herself for school will lose out somewhere.\\r\\n\\r\\n[NURSERY HINTS AND FIRESIDE GEMS 805]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE BABY-CLASS TREE.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe little folks planted a wee, wee, tree,\\r\\n      The tiniest tree of all;\\r\\nRight here by the school-house door it stands\\r\\nWith two little leaves like baby\\'s hands,\\r\\n      So crumpled and soft and small.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd I really believe it is ever so glad\\r\\n     That we planted it there to grow,\\r\\nAnd knows us and loves us and understands,\\r\\nFor it claps them just like two little hands,\\r\\n     Whenever the west winds blow.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Flannel Binder.--The flannel binders for baby should be cut from the\\r\\nsoftest kind of flannel and on the bias to increase their elasticity. They\\r\\nshould be about five inches wide and twenty inches long, with the edges\\r\\nraw, or pinked, perhaps, but not hemmed. After the first six or eight\\r\\nweeks the knitted, circular band which can be bought ready made or may be\\r\\ncrocheted at home, is substituted for the flannel binder.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLOVE.\\r\\n\\r\\nOver and over and over\\r\\n  These truths I will say and sing--\\r\\nThat Love is mightier far than Hate;\\r\\nThat a man\\'s own Thought is a man\\'s own Fate,\\r\\n  And that life is a goodly thing.\\r\\n                   --Ella Wheeler Wilcox.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWholesome Pleasures.--Pleasures for the little ones should be wholesome\\r\\nand sensible, and the dangers of excitement cannot be overestimated. Their\\r\\nminds so ready to receive impressions should receive only the best and\\r\\nmost beneficial, the wholesome air play in the park, or the country, not\\r\\ntoo much company, nor too much noise, nor too many toys.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFROM \"THE CHILDREN\\'S HOUR\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween the dark and the daylight.\\r\\n   When the night is beginning to lower,\\r\\nComes a pause in the day\\'s occupations,\\r\\n   That is known as the Children\\'s Hour.\\r\\n\\r\\nI hear in the chamber above me,\\r\\n   The patter of little feet,\\r\\nThe sound of a door that is opened,\\r\\n   And voices soft and sweet.\\r\\n                             --Longfellow.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nScrubbing Tender Faces.--Children have tender skins as a rule, and yet\\r\\nmothers are very apt to scrub the little faces with soap and water and\\r\\nsend them out to play. Think of such treatment in connection with your own\\r\\nskin. If the children are going out at once after the washing, use warm\\r\\nwater with plain unscented soap, then rub a little good cold cream into\\r\\nthe skin.\\r\\n\\r\\n[806 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nFROM LONGFELLOW\\'S \"VILLAGE BLACKSMITH\"\\r\\n\\r\\nToiling.--rejoicing,--sorrowing,\\r\\n   Onward through life he goes;\\r\\nEach morning sees some task begun,\\r\\n   Each evening sees it close;\\r\\nSomething attempted, something done,\\r\\n   He has earned a night\\'s repose.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSaving the Coverlet.--It is discouraging to the mother to find the\\r\\neiderdown coverlets becoming soiled where the children rub their hands\\r\\nover them. This can be avoided by making a tiny sham of swiss or other\\r\\nsimilar material and basting it across the top of the coverlet. It can be\\r\\npinned into place at the corners with tiny baby pins or caught with a few\\r\\nstitches. These shams edged with narrow lace add a really attractive touch\\r\\nto the coverlet, and they can be quickly removed and easily laundered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Greatness of Love.--There are no little events with the heart; it\\r\\nmagnifies everything. It places in the same scale the falling of an empire\\r\\nand the dropping of a woman\\'s glove; and the glove generally weighs more\\r\\nthan the empire.\\r\\n                                                      --Honore De Balzac.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOranges as Medicine.--One of the most valuable adjuncts in acquiring a\\r\\ngenerally good complexion in youth is that of eating oranges in\\r\\nquantities. Let the mother give her children two or three oranges every\\r\\nday, as they possess many virtues, especially upon the action of the\\r\\nliver. The mother who buys plenty of oranges for the children will note\\r\\nthe reduction in her medicine bill.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE HUMAN FACE.\\r\\n\\r\\n   When I meet a human face,\\r\\n   Lit for me with light divine,\\r\\n   I recall all loving eyes,\\r\\n   That have ever answered mine.\\r\\n                   --Phoebe Cary.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Art of Entertaining Children.--Entertaining convalescent children is\\r\\nquite an art in itself. Nurses who expect to make a specialty of caring\\r\\nfor children sometimes take a brief course in kindergarten work, and\\r\\ncertainly such knowledge is a valuable asset. Quiet games that do not call\\r\\nfor too much exertion, paper-doll plays, the ever-delightful \"cutting out\"\\r\\nof pictures or fashion book people, making scrap books for children\\'s\\r\\nhospitals and simple knitting or crocheting all help to amuse the little\\r\\nfolk. Almost all children enjoy being read to, but care must be taken not\\r\\nto select stories that will depress the child or so excite him as to keep\\r\\nhim awake at night or cause unpleasant dreams.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTireless Talkers.--A sick man that gets talking about himself, a woman\\r\\nthat gets talking about her baby, and an author that begins reading out of\\r\\nhis own book, never know when to stop.--O. W. Holmes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nUnselfishness.--Unselfishness is the key of a happy and beautiful life,\\r\\nand this is one of the first things that should be taught to the little\\r\\none, says a writer in The Woman Beautiful. Insist upon her sharing her\\r\\npleasures, even at a great sacrifice with other children. One mother whom\\r\\nI know has trained her baby to extend an entire box of bon-bons to her\\r\\nlittle friends with the words \"Hop yourself,\" and she does this with a\\r\\ncharm and spontaneity which makes her irresistible.\\r\\n\\r\\n[NURSERY HINTS AND FIRESIDE GEMS 807]\\r\\n\\r\\nA Cheerful Giver.--We should give as we would receive, cheerfully,\\r\\nquickly, and without hesitation; for there is no grace in a benefit that\\r\\nsticks to the fingers.--Seneca.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIndulgence.--It takes far more than the mere mother love to bring up\\r\\nchildren. It takes training, study, knowledge, says the New York Tribune.\\r\\nIt takes self-control in the parents themselves. The mother who spoils a\\r\\nchild through weak indulgence does not truly love her child. She loves her\\r\\nown pleasures in going along the line of least resistance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSelfishness.--When parents spoil their children, it is less to please them\\r\\nthan to please themselves. It is the egotism of parental love.--Carlyle.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMethod.--Now that school days are here, mark umbrellas by writing name on\\r\\nmuslin with ink and sewing to inside of top with black thread; overshoes\\r\\nand rubbers by writing name on the lining, and handkerchiefs by writing\\r\\nname across the center with ink.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSystem.--Marshal thy notions into a handsome method. One will carry twice\\r\\nmore weight packed up in bundles, than when it lies flapping and hanging\\r\\nabout his shoulders.--Fuller.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBaby\\'s Meals.--To make a healthy baby of eighteen or twenty months wait\\r\\nfor the meal times of adults before feeding, is putting too great a strain\\r\\non the little system. Its diet should be adapted to its needs, says a\\r\\ncareful mother. Five light feedings are much more scientific, the first at\\r\\nabout six-thirty in the morning since baby keeps early hours. Milk and\\r\\ntoast should be given at this time. At ten-thirty a. m., well cooked and\\r\\nwell strained cereal might be served with rich milk. Cream is for older\\r\\nchildren. Stewed prunes, baked apples, and oranges are also good. Dinner\\r\\nat one-thirty might include meat broth, or soft boiled eggs, and bread and\\r\\ntoast. Soups must be free from grease. Crackers or toast with a cup of\\r\\nmilk should be served for the five o\\'clock supper, and another cup of milk\\r\\nat bedtime.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nForbearance.--There is a limit at which forbearance ceases to be a\\r\\nvirtue.--Burke.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Romper.--The romper has become an essential part of the young child\\'s\\r\\nwardrobe. They are developed mostly in linen, galatea, and less\\r\\nexpensively still in chambray. The best colors are dark blue, brown,\\r\\ngreen, tan and natural colored linen; green perhaps is best for summer. It\\r\\nis cool looking and it does not show grass stains.

But that does not mean that any of it is to be given\\r\\nto him.

CHAFING DISHES.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy EDNA GERTRUDE THOMPSON,\\r\\n\\r\\nDirector of Domestic Science Department, Thomas Normal Training School,\\r\\nDetroit, Michigan.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTheory and Practice of Domestic Science.--Domestic Science has come to be\\r\\nconsidered one of the most important factors in our public school\\r\\neducation of today. We have just awakened to the fact that our daughters\\r\\nshould receive training in those things which will best fit them for\\r\\nhousewives and mothers. While many of our girls are earning their own\\r\\nlivelihood, the majority ultimately settle into homes of their own. Many\\r\\ngirls have an excellent opportunity to get the training they need as\\r\\nhomemakers from their mothers, but many of the children in this country\\r\\nlack this home training. There are two reasons for this neglect on the\\r\\npart of the mothers: first, the mother may not know how to do these things\\r\\nherself; and, second, she may be a wage-earner and of necessity cannot\\r\\ntrain her daughter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIts Moral Influence.--In the early life of the child it is susceptible to\\r\\ninfluences which may be brought to bear upon it, and if the homemaking\\r\\ninstinct is instilled early much is done toward moral growth of the child.\\r\\nThe public school is expected to develop the child along these lines and\\r\\nconsequently the cookery class, together with the class in housekeeping,\\r\\nhas a mighty influence toward developing noble women. All the home duties\\r\\nare developed and made a pleasure and not a duty to the child, so that the\\r\\nhome is looked upon with favorable eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is an old saying that \"the way to a man\\'s heart is through his\\r\\nstomach.\" This contains much more truth than it would seem on the surface.\\r\\nInvestigators who have made careful research into the divorce question,\\r\\nwhich has assumed such large proportions, state that if women knew more of\\r\\nthe science of home making there would be fewer homes broken up. What man\\r\\nor woman either would not be utterly discouraged to come home day after\\r\\nday to poor meals and untidiness everywhere, conditions which in time\\r\\nbring poor health and disease. The public school aims through domestic\\r\\nscience to teach the importance and dignity of being a good housewife.\\r\\n\\r\\n[818 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nEconomy of Domestic Science.--Then again, domestic science makes a plea\\r\\nfor recognition on the ground of economy. Many times debt and trouble come\\r\\nto homes, not through lack of sufficient funds, but through lack of\\r\\nknowledge on the part of the dispenser of the funds. One of the principles\\r\\nwhich domestic science emphasizes in its teaching is to show how some of\\r\\nour cheaper foods furnish more nutriment to our systems than do some of\\r\\nour more expensive articles of diet. With this fact thoroughly established\\r\\nand understood domestic science tries to develop new and simple methods of\\r\\ncooking such foods and of making them attractive and appetizing. It is a\\r\\nwell-known fact that it is not the amount of food we eat but the amount\\r\\nthat we digest that gives nourishment to our bodies, and it has been\\r\\nproven that food that is not attractive and palatable to us gives only\\r\\none-half the value to our bodies as when it is made attractive and\\r\\npalatable.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGreatest Food Value from Proper Cooking.--Then also students along this\\r\\nline of study have discovered that some of our common foods lose much of\\r\\ntheir value to us through improper cooking and preparation.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf we are going to prepare food and use it as part of our diet, why should\\r\\nwe not obtain the most of its value? Is that not true economy? For an\\r\\nexample of this fact let us take eggs, one of our most common articles of\\r\\ndiet. We commonly cook eggs to harden the white, or albumen, so as to make\\r\\nthem more palatable. One common method of doing this has been to boil\\r\\nthem. Through experiments it has been proven that boiling makes this\\r\\nalbumen so hard to digest that our bodies get practically no value from\\r\\nit. The newer method advanced proves that the same results can be obtained\\r\\nby cooking eggs in water which is kept just below the boiling point, and\\r\\neggs cooked this way are easily and readily assimilated by our bodies. Why\\r\\nshould we not endeavor then to give to our bodies food so prepared that it\\r\\ngives the most nourishment. To take another example,--when salt is added\\r\\nto vegetables it draws out from them into the water their mineral salts\\r\\nand any proteid which will build tissue for us. In most vegetables the\\r\\ncooking water is thrown away so that much of the value of the vegetable is\\r\\nlost. Why should we not try to devise a method of cooking which will save\\r\\nfor us this food value? Salt is added for flavor only, so why cannot the\\r\\nsalt be added a short time before the cooking is finished so that it will\\r\\nnot have time to draw out the food value?\\r\\n\\r\\n[DOMESTIC SCIENCE 819]\\r\\n\\r\\nHow to Save in Cooking Meats.--Again we cook different kinds of meats in\\r\\ndifferent ways. Perhaps you think these different kinds of methods have\\r\\nsimply come down to us through the ages. It is, however, interesting to\\r\\nknow that our mothers probably developed these methods through thought.\\r\\nTough meats, we know, require long  cooking, but do we know why? The\\r\\nfibers and tissues have become strong through constant use on the part of\\r\\nthe animal, and to be of use to us must be softened, so we cook tough\\r\\nmeats long and usually with moisture to accomplish the softening. Tough\\r\\nmeats are our cheap meats, but have you stopped to consider that they\\r\\ncontain more nourishment than our tender meats. As has been stated, the\\r\\ntough meats are the parts of the body of the animal most used and\\r\\nconsequently have been developed and nourished. Why not learn how to cook\\r\\nthese pieces which give us more nourishment, and which are cheaper, in\\r\\nsuch a way as to be attractive and palatable? This is what the Domestic\\r\\nScience Course in our public school aims to teach our girls so that as\\r\\nhousewives they can get the most value for the least money and be\\r\\neconomical and intelligent buyers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOur Winter Supply.--From an instinct, which ought to be common to all of\\r\\nus, in time of plenty we lay something aside for the time of need. As\\r\\nhousewives this truth comes home to us, especially in the summer when we\\r\\nhave an abundance of fruit which, without care, would soon become\\r\\nworthless. By reason of which fact we have developed methods of canning,\\r\\npreserving, etc., which at the present time have become so advanced that\\r\\nwe can retain a very large share of the original color, flavor and shape\\r\\nof the fruit.\\r\\n\\r\\nPreserving Foods.--All food products, on exposure to air, undergo certain\\r\\nchanges which unfit them for use as food. It was once thought that these\\r\\nchanges were due to oxidation, but they are now known to be caused by\\r\\nminute living organisms present in the air, in the water, in the ground\\r\\nand in the food itself. To preserve food two things are necessary; first,\\r\\nto either kill or render harmless those organisms already present; and\\r\\nsecond, to exclude others from entering. The first we usually accomplish\\r\\nby cooking, and the second by sealing. In order to live these organisms\\r\\nrequire three conditions; first, a particular temperature; second, a\\r\\ncertain amount of moisture; third, the right kind of food. By taking away\\r\\nall or anyone of these requirements we may stop the growth or, in other\\r\\nwords, we may preserve the food. For example: with the familiar method of\\r\\ncold storage the factor of temperature is removed; in the drying of the\\r\\nfruits and vegetables the factor of moisture is removed; by salting the\\r\\nfactor of food is taken away.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fruits and vegetables, commonly preserved in the home, are divided\\r\\ninto five classes:\\r\\n\\r\\n  l.--Canning.\\r\\n  2.--Jellies.\\r\\n  3.--Jams.\\r\\n  4.--Marmalades and Butters.\\r\\n  5.--Pickles.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[820 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nCANNING.--Under this head there are four common methods:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Steaming.--By this method the fruit is put into the sterilized jars,\\r\\nthe jars filled with boiling water and the covers loosely set on. Then the\\r\\njars are set on small blocks of wood in a pan of cold water. Cover this\\r\\npan and let the water come to a boil and boil for 15 minutes. Remove the\\r\\njars and fill them with boiling water, if necessary. Seal tightly. Small\\r\\nberries, such as strawberries and raspberries, retain their color and are\\r\\nespecially good done in this manner. Whole tomatoes done in this way are\\r\\nespecially attractive for winter salads, and corn will keep indefinitely.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Boiling in Syrup.--This is the common household method of preserving\\r\\nfruits, such as peaches and pears. A syrup is prepared of sugar and water,\\r\\ninto this the fruit is dropped and cooked until soft; it is then put into\\r\\nsterile jars, sufficient syrup added to fill jar and the jar then sealed.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Preserving.--This is the same as boiling in syrup, except that equal\\r\\nquantities of sugar and fruit are used. Small fruits such as berries are\\r\\nusually done in this way.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Cold Water Process.--This is a simple and easy method to use, and is\\r\\nespecially desirable for vegetables such as rhubarb. Great care must be\\r\\ntaken to use only perfect fruit, because in this method of canning\\r\\nbacteria are merely excluded, not destroyed, and if any are present in the\\r\\nfood there is nothing to prevent it from spoiling. If fruit is over-ripe,\\r\\nor not perfectly fresh one of the other methods, such as boiling or\\r\\nsteaming, is preferable.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Can by the Cold Water Process.--Pack the fruit in a sterilized jar;\\r\\npour over it water which has been boiled and cooled, seal your jar and\\r\\nkeep in a cool place. Sometimes a solution of salt and water is used in\\r\\nplace of pure water. When salt water is used food will need to be\\r\\nfreshened by being allowed to stand in cold water for some time before\\r\\nusing. Vegetables, such as beans, put up in this way are very similar to\\r\\nthe fresh product.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nUtensils.--Among the utensils most necessary for use in preserving foods\\r\\nin the home are scales, measuring cups, porcelain or agate ware sauce\\r\\npans; earthen or agate ware bowls; silver, agate or wooden spoons; an\\r\\nagate colander; small dipper and funnel; new rubbers and perfect covers\\r\\nfor the jars.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Sterilize Jars.--Wash the jars, fill with cold water, place them on\\r\\nrests, such as small blocks of wood on the bottom of the kettle or boiler\\r\\nand surround them with cold water. If blocks of wood are not obtainable\\r\\nthe jars may be wrapped in brown paper to prevent them knocking against\\r\\neach other. Be sure the mouths of the jars are uncovered. Heat gradually\\r\\nuntil the water boils, boil 15 minutes or until ready to fill them.\\r\\nSterilize the covers of the jars also, and dip the rubber bands in boiling\\r\\nwater just before using.\\r\\n\\r\\n[DOMESTIC SCIENCE 821]\\r\\n\\r\\nDirections for Filling Jars.--Remove the jars from the boiling water--the\\r\\nhandle of a wooden spoon is good to use in removing them. Wring a cloth\\r\\nout of hot water and place it on a plate, put the jar to be filled on the\\r\\nhot cloth, put a silver spoon in it,--silver being a good conductor of\\r\\nheat absorbs the heat from the fruit and lessens the danger of breakage.\\r\\nFill the jar with fruit and then add enough syrup or boiling water, as the\\r\\ncase may be, to fill the jar to overflowing. Run a silver knife or spoon\\r\\ndown the sides of the jar to allow any enclosed air to escape; add more\\r\\nsyrup or water, if necessary. Put on the sterilized rubber and seal\\r\\ntightly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTomatoes Canned Whole by Steaming.--Select medium sized, firm, ripe\\r\\ntomatoes. Wash and peel. Pour boiling water over the tomatoes and they\\r\\nwill peel easily. Pack in sterilized jars, fill with boiling water and put\\r\\non the lid lightly. Set in cold water on rests and let boil about fifteen\\r\\nminutes. If necessary, fill the jar with boiling water to overflowing. Put\\r\\non the sterilized rubbers and seal tightly. These tomatoes are especially\\r\\ngood for winter salads.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCanned Corn.--Cut the corn from the cob while fresh, pack in sterilized\\r\\njars, and fill with boiling water. Put the cover on lightly and set on a\\r\\nrest, such as small blocks of wood, pieces of thick paper or the corn\\r\\nhusks, in a pan of cold water. Let boil from two to three hours. Remove\\r\\nthe can, fill to overflowing with boiling water and seal tightly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCanned String Beans.--Select medium sized beans and string. Pack in a\\r\\nsterilized jar, fill to overflowing with a brine and seal tightly. This\\r\\nbrine may be made in two ways: First, by mixing cold water and salt;\\r\\nsecond, by mixing salt and boiling water and then letting it cool before\\r\\npouring over the beans. This method is best as the salt dissolves more\\r\\nreadily in boiling water than in cold water. One part salt to two parts\\r\\nwater makes a strong brine. Keep in a cold place and freshen before using\\r\\nby letting the beans stand in cold water for an hour. In winter these\\r\\nbeans make an acceptable substitute for fresh ones.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCanned Rhubarb.--Select medium stalks, skin and cut either into one-inch\\r\\npieces, or eight-inch lengths. Pack in sterilized jars, fill to\\r\\noverflowing with cold water and seal. Rhubarb put up in this way has been\\r\\nknown to keep for over a year, and is especially good for pies and sauce.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSteamed Strawberries.--Wash and hull the strawberries, and for every quart\\r\\nof strawberries use one cup of sugar. Pack the berries in a sterilized\\r\\njar, cover with sugar and fill with boiling water. Cover the jar lightly,\\r\\nput in a pan of cold water, on a rest and let the water boil for about\\r\\nfifteen minutes. Remove, seal tightly, and keep in a cool place.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCanned Strawberries.--Wash and hull the berries. Make a syrup of sugar and\\r\\nwater, using one cup of sugar to every three of water. Boil 10 minutes.\\r\\nDrop the berries in the boiling syrup and cook until soft. This will\\r\\nrequire only several minutes. Fill the jars to overflowing with fruit and\\r\\nsyrup, then seal.\\r\\n\\r\\n[822 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nCanned Cherries.--Follow the method for strawberries. Cherries can be\\r\\npitted or not, as desired. If pitted, add a few stones for flavor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCanning Raspberries.--Use the same method as for strawberries. The large\\r\\nnumber of seeds in raspberries are objectionable, and the berries are more\\r\\noften made into jam than canned.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCanned Pears.--The pears should be ripe and of fine flavor. Wipe and pare\\r\\nthe fruit. If the pears are large they may be cut in halves. Make a syrup\\r\\nof sugar and water, using one cup of sugar to one cup of water. Boil 10\\r\\nminutes. Put in the pears, cook until soft. Fill sterilized jars and seal.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCanned Peaches.--Follow the directions for pears. Peaches may be canned by\\r\\nthe steaming method by cutting them in two and removing the stones.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nStrawberry Preserves.--Wash and hull the berries, then weigh. Make a syrup\\r\\nby boiling three-quarters of their weight in sugar with water, allowing\\r\\none cup of water to each pound of sugar. Cook syrup 15 minutes, fill glass\\r\\njars with the berries, add the syrup to overflow the jars. Let stand 15\\r\\nminutes. By this time the fruit will have shrunk; add enough more fruit to\\r\\nfill the jar. Put on a cover; set on a rest in a pan of cold water, heat\\r\\nto the boiling point, and keep just below boiling for one hour.\\r\\nRaspberries may be done in the same way.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRaspberry and Currant Preserves.--\\r\\n\\r\\n      3 lbs. Currants.       3 lbs. Sugar.       4 qts. Raspberries.\\r\\n\\r\\nPick over, wash and drain the currants. Put into a preserving kettle and\\r\\nmash. Cook one hour and strain through cheesecloth. Return to the kettle,\\r\\nadd the sugar, heat to the boiling point, cook 20 minutes. Add the\\r\\nraspberries and cook until soft. Fill jars to over-flowing and seal. If\\r\\nthe seeds of the currants are not objectionable the mixture need not be\\r\\nstrained.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nJELLIES.--Fruits to be used in making jelly should be underripe, rather\\r\\nthan over-ripe. Green fruit contains two substances, called \"pectase\" and\\r\\n\"pectose\" and, by the action of the sun in ripening, these substances\\r\\nchange into pectin which makes fruit jelly. If the fruit is over-ripe the\\r\\npectin breaks down into pectosic acid which has not the power of jellying;\\r\\nand as a result the fruit does not jell. If the fruit is a little\\r\\nunder-ripe pectin is formed through cooking, and it is often advisable to\\r\\nadd some green fruit to the ripe fruit in making jelly. Nearly all\\r\\nfailures in jelly making are due either to over-ripe fruit or to the use\\r\\nof too much heat, because in both cases the pectin is lost.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Prepare Glasses for Jelly.--Wash the glasses, put in a kettle of cold\\r\\nwater, heat the water gradually to the boiling point, and boil for fifteen\\r\\nminutes. Remove the glasses and drain; place, while filling, on a cloth\\r\\nwrung out of hot water. If the glasses are wrapped in brown paper with the\\r\\nmouths uncovered they will not break.\\r\\n\\r\\n[DOMESTIC SCIENCE 823]\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Cover Jelly Glasses.--First: with paraffin. Melt the paraffin over hot\\r\\nwater and pour over the jelly when cold about one-fourth inch thick. Be\\r\\nsure to use hot water in melting the paraffin, as it is apt to explode if\\r\\nheated to too high a degree.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSecond.--Cut two pieces of white paper, one just the size of the glass and\\r\\nthe other larger; dip the first cover in brandy or alcohol and press down\\r\\ntightly over the jelly. White of egg or water may be used, but it is not\\r\\nso good. Then cover with the second paper, sealing edges with white of\\r\\negg. A tin cover could be used in place of the last paper.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Make a Jelly Bag.--Take a piece of flannel about three quarters of a\\r\\nyard long, fold the opposite corners together and sew in the shape of a\\r\\ncornucopia, rounding at the end; if the seam is felled it will be more\\r\\nsecure. Bind the top with tape and finish with two or three heavy loops by\\r\\nwhich it may be hung.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGood Fruits for Making Jelly.--Crab apples, snow apples, early summer\\r\\napples, grapes, currants, blackberries, raspberries, quinces, barberries\\r\\nare the fruits most commonly used for making jellies.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral Directions for Making Jelly.--Wash the fruit, remove the stems and\\r\\nimperfections. Cut large fruit into pieces. With fruit such as apples or\\r\\nquinces add enough water to cover them, but with watery fruits, such as\\r\\ngrapes and currants, omit any water. Cook the fruit, until the juice\\r\\nflows, keeping it just below the boiling point. Remove from the fire and\\r\\nstrain through a pointed bag, hung at some height. Allow all the juice\\r\\npossible to drip through before squeezing the bag and keep this juice by\\r\\nitself. Then squeeze the bag and use the juice thus obtained for second\\r\\ngrade jelly, which, while it is not as clear as the first lot, can be used\\r\\nfor jelly cakes, etc. Measure the juice, bring to the boiling point, boil\\r\\nslowly two or three minutes, then add an equal quantity of heated sugar.\\r\\nBoil until the jelly thickens when dropped upon a cold plate. Pour slowly\\r\\ninto sterilized jelly glasses and set away to harden. The jelly bags\\r\\nshould be sterilized before using.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nApple Jelly.--Wipe the apples, remove the stem and blossom ends and cut\\r\\ninto quarters. Put into granite or, porcelain lined preserving kettle and\\r\\nadd enough cold water to come nearly to the top of the apples. Cook slowly\\r\\nuntil the apples are soft. Mash and strain through a coarse sieve. Allow\\r\\nthe juice to drip through a jelly bag. Boil slowly for about 20 minutes,\\r\\nadd an equal quantity of heated sugar, cook for about five minutes or\\r\\nuntil the jelly will harden when dropped on a cold saucer. Pour into\\r\\nsterilized jelly glasses and seal when cold. If the apples are pared a\\r\\nvery light colored jelly is obtained.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCrab Apple Jelly.--Follow the recipe for apple jelly and use red cheeked\\r\\ncrab apples, if possible.\\r\\n\\r\\n[824 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nQuince Jelly.--Follow the recipe for apple jelly, substituting quinces for\\r\\napples. Remove the seeds from the fruit. Sometimes apples and quinces are\\r\\nused in combination and make an excellent jelly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGrape Jelly.--Pick over the grapes, wash and remove stems. Heat to the\\r\\nboiling point, mash and boil 30 minutes. Strain through a jelly bag,\\r\\nreturn the juice to the kettle and boil slowly for about five minutes. Add\\r\\nan equal quantity of heated sugar. Boil three minutes or until it hardens\\r\\non a cold plate. Skim if necessary. Pour into sterilized jelly glasses;\\r\\nseal when cold. Be very sure the grapes are not over-ripe. It is very\\r\\ndesirable to add a few green grapes. Wild grapes make excellent jelly to\\r\\nserve with game.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBarberry Jelly.--This is considered quite a delicacy, and is made the same\\r\\nas grape jelly, except that a very little water,--about one cup to one\\r\\npeck of berries--is sometimes added.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCurrant Jelly.--Pick over the currants but do not remove the stems, wash\\r\\nand drain. Put into a preserving kettle and mash. Cook slowly for about 20\\r\\nto 30 minutes. Strain through a coarse strainer and then through a jelly\\r\\nbag. Follow directions for grape jelly.\\r\\n\\r\\nA combination of currants and raspberries makes a good jelly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRaspberry Jelly.--Follow the directions for grape jelly. Raspberry jelly\\r\\nis hard to make and should not be tried if the fruit is not perfectly\\r\\nfresh or if it is at all over-ripe.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nJAMS.--The pulp, seeds and skins are all retained in jams; often material\\r\\nthat is left from jellies, and so on, can be used in this way by adding\\r\\nspices and nuts to give flavor. Sterilization and the exclusion of air are\\r\\nnot quite so important in this class of preserving on account of the large\\r\\namount of sugar used which takes away food from the bacteria. Equal\\r\\namounts of sugar and fruits are used in making jams.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRaspberry Jam.--Pick over the raspberries, mash in a preserving kettle\\r\\nwith a wooden masher. Heat slowly to the boiling point, and add an equal\\r\\nquantity of heated sugar. Cook slowly for about 45 minutes. Put into\\r\\nsterilized jars.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nStrawberry Jam.--Wash and hull the berries. Add the sugar gradually so\\r\\nthat the juice of the berries will dissolve it. Boil about 20 minutes, or\\r\\nuntil it will harden when dropped on a cold plate. Pour into sterilized\\r\\nglasses.\\r\\n\\r\\nGrape Jam.--\\r\\n\\r\\n      8 Cups of Grapes.       4 Cups of Sugar.\\r\\n\\r\\nWash the grapes, remove the stems and squeeze the pulp from the skins into\\r\\na preserving kettle. Put the skins on a granite plate and save them. Boil\\r\\nthe pulp until the seeds separate easily, stirring constantly. Strain\\r\\nthrough a sieve, add the skins to the strained mixture, measure, return to\\r\\nthe kettle, and add an equal amount of sugar. Boil gently for 15 minutes\\r\\nor until the jam is very thick. Pour into sterilized glasses and seal when\\r\\ncold. The mixture needs careful watching and stirring, as it will burn\\r\\neasily, especially after the sugar is added.\\r\\n\\r\\n[DOMESTIC SCIENCE 825]\\r\\n\\r\\nRhubarb Conserve.--\\r\\n\\r\\n      2 lbs. rhubarb.       2 oranges.\\r\\n      3 lbs. sugar.         1 lb. shelled nuts.\\r\\n      Juice of 3 Lemons.\\r\\n\\r\\nRemove the leaves and pieces of root from the rhubarb and wash the stalks\\r\\nin cold water. Cut into one-inch pieces. Do not remove the skin unless it\\r\\nis fibrous. If the skin is removed do this before cutting in pieces. Wash\\r\\nthe oranges and either grate the rind or cut the yellow into strips thin\\r\\nenough to be seen through. Wash the lemons and use only the juice. A\\r\\nlittle rind may be used, if desired, but it will take away from the orange\\r\\nflavor. The nuts need not be blanched, but should be broken into pieces of\\r\\nmedium size. Any nut may be used, but walnuts are especially good. Mix all\\r\\nthe materials, except the nuts, with the sugar. Cook slowly, stirring\\r\\nconstantly, until the mixture is thick,--about three-quarters of an hour.\\r\\nAfter the first half hour\\'s cooking, add the nuts. Pour into sterilized\\r\\njelly glasses and seal when cold.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMARMALADES AND BUTTERS.--Marmalades and butters are really strained\\r\\njams and the same rules hold true as for jams.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nApple Marmalade.--Pare and core the apples. Cook until tender with just\\r\\nenough water to keep from burning. Force through a fine sieve, return to\\r\\nthe fire with a scant pound of sugar and the juice and rind of one lemon\\r\\nfor each pound of pulp. Cook, stirring with a wooden spoon until the\\r\\nmarmalade is thick when dropped on a cold saucer. Pour into sterilized\\r\\nglasses.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPeach Marmalade.--Follow the recipe for apple marmalade, adding spices,\\r\\nsuch as cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCrab Apple Marmalade.--When making crab apple jelly, core the apples and\\r\\nafter straining, use the pulp that is left to make marmalade. Various\\r\\nseasonings can he added. Among the best are cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg,\\r\\ngrated rind and juice of oranges and lemons. When seasoned according to\\r\\ntaste, add sugar to the pulp, and cook until of the desired consistency.\\r\\nSeal in sterilized jars.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRhubarb Marmalade.--\\r\\n\\r\\n    2 lbs. rhubarb.     3 lbs. sugar.     Rind and pulp of 6 oranges.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoil the ingredients together until thick. The rind of the orange may be\\r\\ngrated and cooked by itself until tender before adding to the rest of the\\r\\nmaterials. Pour into sterilized glasses and seal.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPineapple.--Pare and remove the eyes from pineapple, then grate. Weigh the\\r\\npulp and heat two-thirds of its weight in sugar. Cook the pineapple in an\\r\\nuncovered dish for some time. Then add the juice of one lemon for each\\r\\npound of fruit. Then add the sugar and boil until thick,--about five\\r\\nminutes. Pour into sterilized jelly glasses.\\r\\n\\r\\n[826 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nPICKLES.--Under this heading are classified pickles and relishes, such as\\r\\nchili sauce, chow chows and catsups. Pickling is preserving in salt or\\r\\nacid liquor. Pickles do not contain much nutritive value, but add much to\\r\\na meal in making it attractive. Cucumber pickles should never look as\\r\\ngreen when pickled as the fruit on the vine; if they do it is almost\\r\\ncertain that some preservative has been used.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSweet Pickled Pears or Peaches.--\\r\\n\\r\\n      1 peck peaches.        4 lbs. brown sugar.\\r\\n      1 quart vinegar.       2 ozs. stick cinnamon.\\r\\n      Cloves.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoil sugar, vinegar and cinnamon for 20 minutes. Dip peaches quickly in\\r\\nhot water and rub off fur with a towel. Stick each peach with three or\\r\\nfour cloves, put into syrup and cook until soft. Cook only enough fruit at\\r\\na time to fill one jar. Seal in sterilized jars. Pears may be prepared in\\r\\nthe same way.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChili Sauce.--\\r\\n\\r\\n      25 ripe tomatoes (medium sized).     1/2 cup brown sugar.\\r\\n      4 large white onions.                6 peppers. (chopped fine)\\r\\n      4 teaspoons of ginger.               4 teaspoons of allspice\\r\\n      1 teaspoons of cloves.                2 tablespoons of salt.\\r\\n      1 qt. vinegar.\\r\\n\\r\\nMix these materials and cook for one hour, stirring occasionally. The\\r\\nconsistency should be quite thick and more than an hour\\'s cooking may be\\r\\nnecessary. Strain or not as desired, but if strained put back in the\\r\\nkettle and bring to the boiling point before scaling. Use tall wide necked\\r\\nbottles and fill to overflowing, using the same precautions as you would\\r\\nin canning fruit. The chili sauce is quite \"hot,\" but this can be remedied\\r\\nby altering the number of peppers and onions. In preparing, the tomatoes\\r\\nshould be washed; scalded and peeled. The peppers should be washed in cold\\r\\nwater, the stems removed and the peppers chopped finely. Chop the onions\\r\\nfinely in the same bowl as the peppers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOlive Oil Pickles.--\\r\\n\\r\\n      8 qts. sliced cucumbers.       1 teaspoon cloves.\\r\\n      1 cup olive oil.               1 teaspoon allspice.\\r\\n      1 cup sugar.                   1 teaspoon celery seed.\\r\\n      1 teaspoon mustard seed.       4 teaspoons cinnamon.\\r\\n      One dozen onions.\\r\\n\\r\\nSlice the cucumbers thin and let stand over night in a weak brine. In the\\r\\nmorning drain, add the onions sliced thin. Mix the ingredients given. Put\\r\\nthe cucumbers and onions in a crock, pour over the mixture and add enough\\r\\nvinegar to cover. Mix well.\\r\\n\\r\\n[DOMESTIC SCIENCE 827]\\r\\n\\r\\nSweet Cucumber Pickles.--Select small cucumbers. Wash well but do not\\r\\npeel. Put into a crock one cup of salt and 4 quarts of cucumbers. Cover\\r\\nwith boiling water and let stand over night. In the morning remove from\\r\\nthe brine, put in a granite kettle, cover with vinegar to which has been\\r\\nadded mustard seeds, whole cloves, stick cinnamon, two cups of sugar and\\r\\nother desired seasonings. Let it come to the boiling point, but not boil.\\r\\nSeal while hot.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGreen Tomato Pickles.--Remove a thin slice from each end of the green\\r\\ntomatoes. Slice and sprinkle one peck of tomatoes with one cup of salt and\\r\\nlet stand over night. Drain, boil 15 minutes in two quarts of boiling\\r\\nwater and one quart of vinegar. Drain again. Cook for 10 minutes the\\r\\nfollowing: one gallon of vinegar, 2 pounds or less of sugar, 1 red pepper,\\r\\n10 teaspoon mustard seed, 3/4 cup cinnamon bark, and any other seasonings\\r\\ndesired. Add the tomatoes and simmer for about one hour, stirring\\r\\noccasionally. The spices should be removed; this is easily accomplished if\\r\\nthey are tied in a muslin bag. Pack in sterilized jars.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSOME HINTS ON CHAFING DISH COOKERY.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Use of the Chafing Dish and Some Favorite Recipes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWithin recent years the chafing dish has become very familiar to us. It\\r\\nis, however, not a recent invention, for in the time of Louis XIV it was\\r\\nvery commonly used. To the housekeeper who wishes to save herself and to\\r\\nserve her guests with food at its best, the chafing dish comes as an\\r\\nacceptable friend for use at the breakfast table in the preparation of\\r\\neggs and dishes which should be served immediately. Toast can be served\\r\\nfresh and hot by using a toaster over the burner of a chafing dish. At\\r\\nluncheon a hot dish can easily take the place of the cold meat course if\\r\\nthe chafing dish is at hand. However, the chief use of the chafing dish is\\r\\nin the preparation of late suppers, and is largely in use by those who\\r\\nhave limited facilities for housekeeping, such as college girls. By those\\r\\nwho entertain the chafing dish is looked upon as a true friend of\\r\\nhospitality.\\r\\n\\r\\nChafing dishes vary in price from the common ones made of tin which can be\\r\\nbought for about a dollar, to the more expensive ones made of silver.\\r\\nVarious wares are utilized for the chafing dish. Among those most\\r\\nsatisfactory are graniteware, earthenware, nickel, copper and aluminum.\\r\\n\\r\\n[828 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nTo get satisfactory results with the chafing dish you must have certain\\r\\nparts. There should be a pan to use for hot water, and it should be\\r\\nfurnished with a handle. The cooking pan or blazer, as it is called,\\r\\nshould have a handle also. Until one becomes an expert the hot water pan\\r\\nshould be in constant use but later one need only use the hot water pan\\r\\nfor keeping food warm. The burner should be carefully looked after and be\\r\\nin readiness. Alcohol, electricity and gas are all used as fuel, but\\r\\ndenatured or wood alcohol is probably the most common of all. If care is\\r\\ntaken in the use of alcohol there need be no danger. Fill the lamp with\\r\\nsufficient alcohol to cook the dish desired, and if necessary to refill\\r\\nduring cooking shut off the flame and let the burner cool somewhat before\\r\\nreplenishing with the alcohol. A large tray upon which to set the chafing\\r\\ndish prevents danger of fire and protects the table. Large forks and\\r\\nspoons, made especially for the chafing dish, can be obtained at a small\\r\\nprice, but any table spoon and fork can be used. It is well to have a\\r\\nnapkin and extra spoon and fork at hand if it is necessary to taste the\\r\\npreparation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat a chafing dish supper may be a success, care should be taken on the\\r\\npart of the hostess to have everything in readiness. The table should be\\r\\nset with the required dishes, silver, etc., and all ingredients should be\\r\\nat hand for the preparation that is to be made on the chafing dish. Most\\r\\nchafing dishes will not supply portions for more than eight, so that a\\r\\nlarger number should not be included at a chafing dish supper. Unless\\r\\nskilled in the use of a chafing dish, it is best not to prepare new dishes\\r\\nfor guests. If one will observe some care and have everything in\\r\\nreadiness, a chafing dish supper can be a very enjoyable source of\\r\\nentertainment for informal affairs.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo use the following recipes with success level measurements of all\\r\\ningredients must be made--level teaspoon, level cup, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSOME FAVORITE CHAFING DISH CONCOCTIONS.\\r\\n\\r\\nCream Sauce.--\\r\\n\\r\\n    2 tablespoons flour.        1/2 teaspoon salt.\\r\\n    2 tablespoons butter.       1/4 teaspoon pepper.\\r\\n    1 cup milk.\\r\\n\\r\\nMelt the butter and stir in the flour and seasonings until smooth; add the\\r\\nscalded milk slowly, stirring constantly. Cook until of the right\\r\\nconsistency. This makes a medium thick sauce, the thickness of which can\\r\\nbe varied by increasing or diminishing the amount of flour. This is the\\r\\nfoundation for a great number of chafing dish recipes, such as creamed\\r\\ndishes.

Apples and Quinces.--Pare and cut the apples and quinces, the same\\r\\namount of each. Cook the quinces in enough water to cover them until\\r\\ntender. Remove these from the water and cook the apples in the same\\r\\nliquid. When these are done put in a jar or kettle a layer of quinces,\\r\\nthen of apples until all are used. Pour over them a syrup made of a half\\r\\npound of sugar to pound of quinces, dissolved in a little water and let it\\r\\nstand over night. The next day heat them thoroughly and seal in cans.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Apple Sauce.--Take as many apples as desired, pare them and cut in\\r\\nquarters. Put in a stew pan filled about two-thirds with water and cook\\r\\nuntil tender. Remove from the fire and beat up thoroughly, adding a\\r\\nteaspoonful of butter to a quart of apple sauce, half cup sugar and grate\\r\\nin a quarter of nutmeg. Serve with or without cream.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Apples to Can.--Cook the same as for apple sauce, leaving out all\\r\\nseasoning and sugar. Put in glass jars and seal. When these are opened in\\r\\nthe winter, just add such seasoning as may be desired.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Apple Butter.--Five pounds of brown sugar, three gallons of cooked\\r\\napples, one quart of cider vinegar. Boil this down to about two gallons\\r\\nand season with cinnamon.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n5. Canned Pears.--Prepare a syrup of one pint of water and one cup sugar\\r\\nto one quart of fruit. Before doing this, have your pears all pared and\\r\\nready for the syrup when done. As you pare each piece of fruit drop it\\r\\ninto a dish of cold water. This will prevent the fruit from turning dark.\\r\\nWhen the syrup has come to a fast boil, put in the pears carefully and\\r\\nboil until they look clear and can be easily pierced with a fork, which\\r\\nwill probably be about twenty minute. Then done place in glass jars.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n6. Canned Pineapple.--Pare the pineapple and cut in slices about one-half\\r\\ninch thick. Be sure that all the eyes are cut out, as the fruit will spoil\\r\\nquickly if these remain in. Make a syrup of one pound of sugar to quart of\\r\\nwater. When this syrup becomes thick enough, add the fruit and let boil\\r\\nabout fifteen minutes. When done place in glass jars and seal while hot.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n7. Canned Peaches.--Pare the peaches and cut in halves and lay in a dish\\r\\nof cold water until ready to put in the syrup. Make a syrup of one quart\\r\\nof hot water to a pound of sugar. Let this cook to a syrup, then add the\\r\\nfruit. Cook about eight minutes. Put in glass jars and seal while hot.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n8. Brandy Peaches.--Drop the fruit into hot water. Let it remain there\\r\\nuntil the skin can be taken off easily. Make a very thin syrup and cover\\r\\nthe peaches, after skin has been removed. Boil in this thin syrup until\\r\\nthe fruit can be pierced with a straw. While these are cooking make\\r\\nanother syrup, very rich, into which put the fruit after it is done.\\r\\nRemove this from the fire and add an equal quantity of brandy while the\\r\\nsyrup is still hot.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n9. Canned Plums.--Wash the fruit well in cold water, then add one pound of\\r\\nsugar to a pound of fruit and let boil ten minutes. When done put in glass\\r\\njars and seal while hot.\\r\\n\\r\\n[CANNING, PICKLING AND PRESERVING 833]\\r\\n\\r\\n10. Canned Strawberries.--Wash the berries thoroughly before removing the\\r\\nstems. Then weigh them, and to each pound of berries allow a half pound of\\r\\nsugar. Let these boil about ten minutes, and they are ready for the cans.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n11. Canned Rhubarb.--Take rhubarb when it is young and tender, or even the\\r\\nlater plant will do, cut into pieces about an inch long. Wash well and put\\r\\nin glass jars, into which has been poured a cupful of cold water. Fill the\\r\\njar full of the rhubarb and then cover completely with water. Seal and put\\r\\nin a cool place. When opened in the winter time a few minutes\\' boiling\\r\\nwith sugar added will make a delightful sauce.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n12. Canning Corn.--The following is one of the safest and surest ways of\\r\\ncanning sweet corn, without the use of acids or the necessity of putting\\r\\nup the corn with tomatoes, etc. Cut the corn from the cob and put in glass\\r\\njars, pack down tightly and screw covers on loosely to allow the air to\\r\\nescape. Set the jars in a boiler and fill the boiler with cold water until\\r\\nit reaches the rim of the jars and let boil for four hours. Remove the\\r\\ncans and when sufficiently cool tighten the lids and set them away. A good\\r\\nplan is to place a board or some corn husks in the bottom of the boiler on\\r\\nwhich to set the jars to prevent them from cracking. Corn will keep as\\r\\nlong as you want it if canned in this way.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n13. Canned Grapes.--Take the grapes and wash them thoroughly. Have two\\r\\ndishes on the table. Put the seeds in one dish and the skins in the other.\\r\\nBoil the pulp until all the seeds come out easily, then put through a\\r\\nsieve. Add the skins, allowing one-half pound sugar to one pound of fruit.\\r\\nWhen done put either in glass jars or crocks, taking precaution to see\\r\\nthat they are sealed tightly in either case.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTABLE FOR CANNING FRUIT.\\r\\n                                                Time\\r\\n                       Quantity of sugar        for boiling\\r\\n                       per quart.               fruit.\\r\\n    Apricots              2       teacupfuls    10 minutes\\r\\n    Sour Apples           1-1/2      \"          10   \"\\r\\n    Crab Apples           2          \"          25   \"\\r\\n    Black Berries         1-1/2      \"           6   \"\\r\\n    Gooseberries          2          \"           8   \"\\r\\n    Raspberries           1          \"           6   \"\\r\\n    Huckleberries         1          \"           5   \"\\r\\n    Strawberries          2          \"           8   \"\\r\\n    Cherries              1-1/2      \"           5   \"\\r\\n    Currants              2          \"           6   \"\\r\\n    Wild Grapes           2          \"          10   \"\\r\\n    Sour Pears (whole)    2          \"          30   \"\\r\\n    Bartlett Pears        1-1/2      \"          20   \"\\r\\n    Peaches (in halves)   2          \"           8   \"\\r\\n    Plums                 2          \"          10   \"\\r\\n    Peaches (whole)       1          \"          15   \"\\r\\n    Pineapple (sliced)    1-1/2      \"          15   \"\\r\\n    Quinces               3          \"          30   \"\\r\\n    Rhubarb               3          \"          10   \"\\r\\n    Tomatoes              0          \"          20   \"\\r\\n\\r\\n[834 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nPICKLING.\\r\\n\\r\\n1.

Pickled Onions.--Select small white onions, peel and boil them in\\r\\nequal portions of sweet milk and water for ten minutes, or until tender,\\r\\ndrain and pour scalding spiced vinegar on them immediately. Never use\\r\\nallspice, as it darkens the onions.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n11. Pickled Red Cabbage.--Choose purple red cabbage, slice into a\\r\\ncolander, sprinkle each layer with salt, let it drain two days, then put\\r\\ninto a jar, pour boiling vinegar enough to cover, put in a few slices of\\r\\nred beet-root.

Add a little lemon juice or sliced lemon; keep skimming\\r\\nthis as it boils, and put in only a few apples at a time into the syrup,\\r\\nand boil until they are transparent; skim out and put in a jar. When the\\r\\napples are done, boil the syrup down thick, then pour boiling hot over the\\r\\napples and cover closely. Well flavored fruit, not easily broken, should\\r\\nbe selected.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n8. Apricot Preserves.--Pare the fruit very thin and stone it. Place the\\r\\nfruit in a porcelain or granite kettle, first a layer of fruit, then a\\r\\nlayer of sugar, using pound for pound of sugar. Let this stand in the\\r\\nkettle for a day. The next day boil very gently until they are clear. Then\\r\\nplace the fruit in a large pan or bowl and pour the liquor over them. The\\r\\nfollowing day pour the liquor into a quart of codlin liquor, this being\\r\\nmade by boiling and straining a pound of fine sugar with just enough water\\r\\nto make a syrup. Let the whole boil quickly until it will jelly. Put the\\r\\nfruit into it and bring to a boil, being careful to remove all the scum.\\r\\nThen put up in small jars.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n9. Citron Preserves.--Select sound fruit, pare it and divide into\\r\\nquarters, (carefully take out the seeds) and cut in very small pieces, any\\r\\nshape you desire, and weigh it. To every pound of fruit allow a half pound\\r\\nof loaf sugar; put the citron on to cook until it is quite clear, then\\r\\nremove it from the kettle where it can drain, and pour out the water it\\r\\nwas cooked in. Then put on the sugar you have weighed, with water enough\\r\\nto wet it through; let it boil until very clear, and before putting in the\\r\\ncitron again add to the syrup two large lemons sliced, and a small piece\\r\\nof ginger root, to give it a fine flavor; then add the citron and let all\\r\\ncook together about fifteen minutes; fill the jars with citron and pour\\r\\nover the hot syrup, then seal up.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n10.

These are delicious.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n11. Preserved Pears.--Have a pan of cold water ready to drop pears into\\r\\nafter they are pared, halved and the cores removed. This will prevent them\\r\\nfrom turning black. Select smooth, sweet pears of a kind which will not\\r\\nbreak when cooked. Put a little over one quart of granulated sugar into\\r\\nyour preserving kettle; add just water enough to moisten the sugar; when\\r\\nwarm put into this two quarts of pears; let them cook very slowly several\\r\\nhours; when the syrup is thick put your fruit in jars.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n12.

The next\\r\\nmorning take the apples out of the syrup, cook the syrup until it\\r\\nthickens, replace the apples and boil fifteen minutes; remove the\\r\\npineapple from the syrup and let them cool, then put in jars and pour the\\r\\nsyrup over them. A few pieces of ginger root boiled in the syrup will\\r\\nimprove it.\\r\\n\\r\\n[CANNING, PICKLING AND PRESERVING 843]\\r\\n\\r\\n13. Tomato Preserves.--Select small, pear-shaped tomatoes, not too ripe.\\r\\nPrick with a needle to prevent bursting, and put their weight in sugar\\r\\nover them. Let this stand over night, then pour off the juice into a\\r\\npreserving kettle and boil until it is a thick syrup, clarifying it with\\r\\nthe white of an egg; add the tomatoes and boil until they look\\r\\ntransparent. One lemon to a pound of fruit, sliced thin and cooked with\\r\\nthe fruit, together with a piece of ginger root, will improve it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n14. Preserved Strawberries. No. 1.--Take a couple of quarts of berries at\\r\\na time, remove the stems, and place in a colander. Pour water over them to\\r\\ncleanse them. Make a syrup of two pounds of white sugar and a half cup of\\r\\nwater. Drop the berries into this and allow them to boil rapidly for\\r\\ntwenty minutes, removing all scum that rises, but do not stir the fruit.\\r\\nPour into tumblers, and when you are done cook your syrup and juice to a\\r\\njelly and fill up your jelly glasses. Keep in a dry place.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n15. Preserved Strawberries. No. 2.--To one pound of berries use\\r\\nthree-fourths of a pound of sugar,--in layers (no water). Place in a\\r\\nkettle on the back of the stove until the sugar is dissolved into syrup;\\r\\nthen let it come to a boil, stirring from the bottom. Spread on platters,\\r\\nnot too thickly and set out in the hot sun till the syrup thickens--it may\\r\\ntake two or three days. Keep in tumblers or bowls like jelly. Strawberries\\r\\ndone in this way retain their color and flavor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n16. Spiced Currants.--Three pounds white sugar, five pounds ripe currants,\\r\\none tablespoonful each of cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves and allspice. Boil\\r\\ncurrants one hour, then add sugar, spices and a half pint vinegar, boil a\\r\\nhalf hour longer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n17. Spiced Gooseberries.--Six quarts gooseberries, nine pounds sugar, cook\\r\\none and a half hours, then add one pint vinegar, one tablespoonful each\\r\\ncloves, cinnamon and allspice. Boil a few minutes. When cold they should\\r\\nbe like jam. Boil longer if not thick enough.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n18. Tomato Preserves.--Peel the tomatoes and to each pound add a pound of\\r\\nsugar and let stand over night. Take the tomatoes out of the sugar and\\r\\nboil the syrup, removing the scum. Put the tomatoes in and boil gently\\r\\ntwenty minutes; remove fruit again and boil until the syrup thickens. On\\r\\ncooling put the fruit into jars and pour the syrup over. The round yellow\\r\\nvariety of tomato should be used and as soon as ripe.\\r\\n\\r\\n[844 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\n19. Preserved Pears.--Peel the fruit which should not be overripe, cut\\r\\ninto halves, extract cores and throw at once into a dish of cold water.\\r\\nFrom the water put into jars, arranging the pieces as compactly as\\r\\npossible, cover with cold water and then drain off. Make a syrup of sugar\\r\\nand water, allowing a teacupful of sugar to a jar and fill the jars to the\\r\\nbrim; put on the covers, without rubbers and place in a kettle of cold\\r\\nwater over the fire. The water in the kettle should come to the neck of\\r\\nthe jars. Note carefully when the water comes to a boil, and let it boil\\r\\ntwenty minutes or more, according to ripeness of the fruit. Take the jars\\r\\nfrom the water, adjust the rubbers and screw on the tops tighter and\\r\\ntighter as the jars cool. A plated knife should be used in peeling the\\r\\nfruit as a steel one discolors the fruit.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n20. Preserved Peaches.--Plunge the fruit into boiling water to make the\\r\\nskins come off easily, then throw into cold water. For three pounds of\\r\\nfruit use one pound of sugar and half a teacup of water. When the syrup\\r\\nboils put in the peaches, a few at a time, and cook until tender. Fill\\r\\njars as for pears. The stones will add to the flavor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n21. Brandied Peaches.--Put the peaches in boiling water for a few minutes,\\r\\nwhen the skin will peel off easily. Make a syrup of half a pound of sugar\\r\\nand half a teacupful of water for each pound of peaches. Skim as the scum\\r\\nrises in boiling, then put in the peaches and boil them gently until\\r\\ntender, no longer. Take them out carefully and fill your cans or jars.\\r\\nRemove the syrup from the fire, and add to it half a pint of best brandy\\r\\nto every pound of peaches.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n22. Preserved Quinces.--Pare and quarter, taking out cores and all hard\\r\\nparts. Boil in clear water until tender; spread out to dry. Allow a half\\r\\npound of sugar and one-third cup water to a pound of fruit. When the syrup\\r\\nboils, put in the fruit, set back on stove and cook very slowly for an\\r\\nhour or more if not too tender, as the longer it cooks the brighter will\\r\\nbe the color. Put in jars, the same as other fruit.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n23. Preserved Grapes.--A delicious preserve can be made of California\\r\\ngrapes. Cut each grape with a knife and extract the seeds; add sugar to\\r\\nthe fruit, pound for pound; cook slowly for half an hour or longer until\\r\\nthe syrup and pulp of the grape are perfectly clear and transparent.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n24. Purple Plums Preserved.--A very fine preserve can be made from these\\r\\nplums, if you take equal weight of fruit and sugar. Take a clear stone jar\\r\\nand fill it with the fruit and sugar. First a layer of fine granulated\\r\\nsugar, then the plums and so on until the jar is filled. Cover them and\\r\\nset the jar in a kettle of water over the fire. Let them stand in the\\r\\nboiling water all day, filling up the kettle as the water boils away. If\\r\\nat any time they seem likely to ferment, repeat this process. Any\\r\\nhousewife trying this recipe will be greatly pleased with the results.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n25. Spiced Grapes.--Select five pounds of nice grapes, pulp them, and boil\\r\\nuntil tender. After the pulps are thoroughly cooked, strain through a\\r\\nsieve, then add to it three pounds of sugar, two teaspoonfuls of cinnamon\\r\\nand allspice, and half teaspoonful of cloves. Add enough vinegar and\\r\\nspices to suit the taste. Boil thoroughly and cool. This is very nice.\\r\\n\\r\\n[CANNING, PICKLING AND PRESERVING 845]\\r\\n\\r\\n26. Spiced Peaches.--Take five pounds of peaches, wipe them thoroughly and\\r\\nboil until tender in one quart of vinegar and two pounds of brown sugar.\\r\\nWhen done remove them from the liquid, and add one ounce each of cinnamon,\\r\\ncloves and mace.

Pear Chips.--Ten pounds of pears sliced thin, seven pounds of sugar,\\r\\nfour lemons boiled soft; press out the juice and pulp; chop the peel very\\r\\nfine. Boil the fruit and sugar together until soft, then add the lemon, a\\r\\nhalf pound green ginger root scraped and cut into small pieces. Let the\\r\\nabove mixture boil until quite thick. This can be placed in jelly glasses,\\r\\nand will keep nicely. This is an excellent recipe.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nJAMS AND JELLIES.\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Crab Apple Jelly.--Select nice ripe apples, wash and cut out any\\r\\nimperfections; place on the stove and cover with water, cook slowly until\\r\\nsoft enough to strain, then take them off and drain through a jelly bag.\\r\\nTo every four pints of juice use three pints of sugar; heat the sugar very\\r\\nwarm in the oven. Boil the juice fourteen minutes, stir in warm sugar, and\\r\\nboil altogether three to five minutes, then turn into moulds or jelly\\r\\nglasses.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Apple Jelly.--After you have selected nice tart, juicy apples of good\\r\\nflavor, pare them, core and quarter, then put them with the skins and\\r\\ncores, in a jar in a slow oven. When they are quite soft, strain all\\r\\nthrough a coarse muslin bag, pressing hard to extract all the flavor of\\r\\nthe fruit. Put a pound of loaf sugar to every pint of juice and the juice\\r\\nof one lemon, and put the liquor over the fire in a preserving kettle.\\r\\nBoil steadily for twenty minutes or so, skimming occasionally. Boil the\\r\\njelly glasses in hot water and fill them with the jelly while hot. This\\r\\njelly will keep for an unlimited time if kept in a cool, dry place.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Currant Jelly.--The currants should be washed very thoroughly, but do\\r\\nnot stem; put in a kettle, scald them but do not cook. Cool and strain;\\r\\nboil the juice alone for twenty minutes. Weigh the sugar, and to a pint of\\r\\njuice use a pound of sugar. Have the sugar in the oven browning lightly\\r\\nand heating thoroughly.

Grape Jelly.--Select grapes that are partially ripe, as they make the\\r\\nprettiest jelly, and to every eight pounds of fruit take a large cupful of\\r\\nwater; put them into a porcelain-lined kettle and boil until quite soft;\\r\\nstrain through a cloth. Measure the juice, then measure and put away the\\r\\nsame quantity of sugar. Let the juice boil half an hour, then add the\\r\\nsugar and let it boil five or ten minutes longer. All jellies to be good,\\r\\nshould have nearly all the boiling done before the sugar is added.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n7. Rhubarb and Apple Jelly.--Cut up your rhubarb and wash it; put on the\\r\\nfire without any water at all. Take good sour apples, pare and quarter and\\r\\ncook in a very little water. Strain the juice from both and put them on\\r\\nthe stove to cook for fifteen minutes. Then add the heated sugar, using\\r\\nthree-fourths as much sugar as juice. Boil hard for twenty minutes, turn\\r\\ninto glasses and set in the sun, if possible, for half a day. Seal the\\r\\nnext day.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n8. Spiced Grape Jelly.--Take grapes half ripe, crush all the juice out\\r\\nwell and strain. Take equal quantities of juice and sugar; to each quart\\r\\nof juice add one-half teaspoonful of cloves and one tablespoonful\\r\\ncinnamon. Cook very hard for twenty minutes, then remove from the stove\\r\\nand pour into glasses.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n9. Rhubarb Jelly.--After the rhubarb has been thoroughly washed and cut up\\r\\nin small pieces, stew until tender in a preserving kettle. Strain through\\r\\na jelly rag and flavor with extract of lemon. Put in enough to suit the\\r\\ntaste. To each pint of juice add a pound of sugar; boil until it jellies\\r\\non the skimmer, then remove and place in glasses. Keep in a cool place.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n10. Orange Marmalade.--Cut the oranges in half; remove the pulp with a\\r\\nspoon, take one lemon to five oranges, preparing the same way. Then cut\\r\\nthe shells of the oranges in two, scrape out the white lining and put the\\r\\nskins on to boil; weigh the pulp, take half as much sugar, and simmer\\r\\ntogether fifteen minutes. When the skins are transparent and tender, take\\r\\nup, putting several pieces together, cut it quickly into the narrowest\\r\\npossible strips. Mix these with pulp and sugar; cook until very thick. Put\\r\\nin glasses and then when cold, seal.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n11. Blackberry Jam.--Take two quarts of blackberries, one quart fine\\r\\ncooked apples, two quarts of sugar, boil these all together for twenty\\r\\nminutes. This is very easily made and is very good.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n12. Plum and Apple Jam.--After canning plums, there is often some left,\\r\\nnot enough to fill a can; a very nice jam can be made of this by putting\\r\\nit through a sieve; and adding the same quantity of good apples, cooked.\\r\\nSweeten to taste and put in a very little cinnamon and cloves. Cook an\\r\\nhour, then tie up in jars when cold.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n13. Tomato Marmalade.--Pare and slice without wetting four pounds of\\r\\nunripe tomatoes, Give them a slow boil for several hours until a large\\r\\nportion of the water has evaporated; add for each pound of tomatoes\\r\\nthree-quarters of a pound of sugar and two sliced lemons. Boil for one\\r\\nhour longer.\\r\\n\\r\\n[CANNING, PICKLING AND PRESERVING 847]\\r\\n\\r\\n14. Raspberry Jams.--To three or four pounds of ripe red raspberries add\\r\\nan equal quantity of white sugar. Crush the whole well in a preserving\\r\\nkettle; add one pint of currant juice and boil gently until it jellies\\r\\nupon a cold plate; put into a small jar and cover with brandied paper. Tie\\r\\nover them a thick paper and keep in a dark, cool, dry place.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n15. Strawberry Jam, with Red Currants.--Take four pounds of strawberries,\\r\\none pint of red currant juice, and two pounds of sugar. Place in a\\r\\nporcelain kettle and boil the berries and currant juice first, then add\\r\\nthe sugar and boil up again, skimming well. Put in jars, cover with\\r\\nparaffin and keep in a cool place.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n16. Peach Jelly.--Cook peaches and add a few kernels; when done strain. To\\r\\none pint of peach liquor add one lemon and one pound of sugar. Dry and\\r\\nheat the sugar in a separate pan and let the peach liquor boil twenty\\r\\nminutes. Then add the sugar and boil a few minutes longer. This is very\\r\\nnice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n17. Gooseberry Jam.--To one pound of pulped fruit, add three-fourths pound\\r\\nof sugar. Stew the berries in a little water, press through a coarse sieve\\r\\nor colander. Then place on the stove again and add sugar. Boil\\r\\nthree-quarters of an hour, stirring constantly.

Hundreds of tons of candy are annually consumed, and\\r\\nfortunes have been made in the business. The range of price is from ten\\r\\ncents to a dollar a pound, with some specially wrapped and boxed bon-bons\\r\\nexceeding the latter price, not because of intrinsic excellence, but\\r\\nbecause of the ornamental form in which they are presented. Cheap candies\\r\\nare adulterated and hence more or less detrimental to health. Good candies\\r\\nare not harmful, unless eaten to excess. Delicious candy may be made at\\r\\nhome at much less cost, and some famous candies, like the \"Mary Elizabeth\"\\r\\nand others, had their beginnings in a home kitchen and grew into popular\\r\\nfavor because of their known purity and uniform excellence. The cost of\\r\\nten one-pound boxes of candies is estimated at $1.50 when materials are\\r\\nbought in small quantities; such candies, placed on sale at church fairs,\\r\\nbazars, etc., are sold at forty and fifty cents per box. Even at\\r\\ntwenty-five cents a box there is a profit of ten cents on each box. Any\\r\\ngirl can prepare bon-bons for a luncheon or a party at home, if she is\\r\\nwilling to take the trouble,--which is, after all, a pleasure to many. She\\r\\nmay save her own candy boxes and by getting a supply of paraffin paper,\\r\\nfill them again with candies quite as good as those they originally\\r\\ncontained; or buy new boxes of the paper box manufacturers at two or three\\r\\ncents apiece. A box of home-made candy makes a nice Christmas or birthday\\r\\ngift.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBoiling the Sugar.--Confectioners recognize seven degrees in boiling sugar\\r\\nfor candy, only four of which, however, are practically important. The\\r\\nfirst of these is the \"thread\" at about 215 degrees, by the sugar\\r\\nthermometer, when a short thin thread forms when thumb and forefinger are\\r\\nseparated with a drop of syrup between them. This passes very quickly into\\r\\na second stage, known as the large or long thread, when it can be drawn\\r\\nout to a considerably greater length without breaking. In a moment more it\\r\\ncan be extended as far as the thumb and forefinger can be separated. The\\r\\nnext stage is the \"pearl,\" shown when the surface of the syrup is covered\\r\\nwith bubbles, and is the stage at which much candy is made. The \"blow\" and\\r\\n\"feather\" come next; then the \"ball\" or fondant stage at 235 to 245\\r\\ndegrees; this is the third important stage. To discover when the boiling\\r\\nhas progressed to this stage, drop a little of the syrup on to ice water,\\r\\nor dip the tips of the thumb and forefinger into ice water and then into\\r\\nthe syrup and instantly into the ice water again with the syrup between.\\r\\nOne can use a small stick in the same way. If the syrup can be rolled into\\r\\na soft, but not sticky ball, it is in the soft ball stage; half a minute\\r\\nmore of boiling will convert it into the \"hard ball,\" if tested in the\\r\\nsame manner. For fondant, the \"soft ball\" is chosen. The next is the\\r\\n\"crack\" or brittle stage, at about 300 degrees; when testing as above the\\r\\nsyrup remains dry and hard on the fingers. This is the stage for candy\\r\\nthat is to be pulled. At the caramel stage the syrup begins to brown, and\\r\\nmust be quickly taken from the fire or it becomes \"burnt sugar;\" dropped\\r\\nin water it crackles and snaps.\\r\\n\\r\\n[CANDY MAKING       849]\\r\\n\\r\\nMaking the Fondant.--Fondant (\"foundation\") is the basis of all French\\r\\nbon-bons, so-called. An endless number of varieties may be made from it in\\r\\ncombination with other material. There are two ways of preparing it. The\\r\\neasiest and simplest way is to add to the white of an egg an equal bulk of\\r\\ncold water and a teaspoonful of vanilla; beat until it froths, then add,\\r\\ngradually, one pound or more, of confectioners\\' XXX sugar; if the egg is\\r\\nlarge, one and one-half pounds may be required. Ordinary sugar will not\\r\\ndo. Add sugar until the mixture forms a stiff paste; work this with a\\r\\nspoon until it is very smooth, then put away in a cool place for at least\\r\\ntwenty-four hours, letting it stand in an earthen dish, and cover with a\\r\\ndoubled napkin wrung out of cold water.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFrench, or Boiled Fondant.--Put into a porcelain lined kettle a pint of\\r\\nthe best granulated cane sugar, half a pint of cold water and a salt spoon\\r\\nof cream of tartar dissolved in warm water. Stir it till the sugar is\\r\\ndissolved and boil rapidly without stirring or moving the kettle. Without\\r\\na sugar thermometer it is impossible to tell exactly how many minutes it\\r\\nshould boil, but usually in about ten minutes a little of the syrup\\r\\ndropped into cold water will form a soft waxy ball between the moistened\\r\\nfingers. It should then be removed from the fire and put in a cool place\\r\\nuntil the hand can rest with comfort on the bottom of the kettle. If too\\r\\nhot, it will turn back to sugar; if too cold, it will not thicken\\r\\nproperly. In either case it is not spoiled, try again; add boiling water,\\r\\nstir until dissolved, and repeat the boiling. A little experience makes\\r\\none to seize \"the psychological moment\" when the syrup is in the right\\r\\ncondition. When the syrup has cooled to the degree indicated above, begin\\r\\nto stir it, using a long-handled wooden spoon. It will turn milky at\\r\\nfirst, then thick and white, finally dry on the edge of the dish and get\\r\\nso stiff it is difficult to stir. Then take the mass out on a marble slab\\r\\nand knead as you would bread dough; if you have no marble slab you may\\r\\nwork it in the hands.\\r\\n\\r\\n[350 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nFlavor and Color.--At this point add the flavoring. Make little holes in\\r\\nthe fondant with the fingers and put in each a little of the flavoring,\\r\\nworking it through the mass. The essential oils are better than extracts.\\r\\nThree or four drops of any of the oils will flavor a pound of fondant.\\r\\nThree cents worth would be sufficient for a number of pounds. The flavor\\r\\nshould not be strong. About a teaspoonful of any extract will be\\r\\nsufficient. If it is desirable to have two or more flavors, divide the\\r\\nfondant into the required number of portions, and have an assistant take\\r\\nup the kneading of each. Work the fondant until it is creamy. The pure\\r\\nfood laws discourage the use of colorings, and it is difficult for the\\r\\namateur to procure them in economical quantities. Cochineal can always be\\r\\nhad and provides any number of shades of pink. Spinach heated over steam,\\r\\nand the juice expressed, gives a pretty green which is perfectly harmless.\\r\\nWork into the fondant as you used the flavoring oil or extract. The above\\r\\ningredients will make one pound of fondant, all the beginners should\\r\\nundertake at one time. It may be kept for some time by packing it in glass\\r\\ncans and sealing tightly. The fondant should \"mellow\" for at least\\r\\ntwenty-four hours before being used, especially as centers for chocolate\\r\\ncreams, etc.; and these in turn should stand as long before being dipped.\\r\\nIt is also advisable to let the bon-bons stand a day at least before being\\r\\nwrapped and packed. Choose a dry, clear, quiet day to make fondant, and do\\r\\nnot attempt to work with it in wet weather; it is very sensitive to\\r\\natmospheric conditions.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMaking the Bon-bons.--After the fondant has stood the required interval it\\r\\nis ready to make up. Here comes in play the ingenuity of the candy maker\\r\\nin the employment of various accessories. Candied cherries, candied\\r\\nviolets and rose petals, angelica, dates, figs, hard jellies, raisins,\\r\\nwhite grapes, crystallized ginger, cocoanuts, marshmallows, nuts, all are\\r\\nemployed, while chocolate is used in so many forms that it gives rise to\\r\\nan entire class of candies. When ready to make up the bon-bons, roll the\\r\\nfondant out evenly and cut in squares of equal size; shape these with the\\r\\nfingers. The hands must be frequently dipped into ice water and wiped dry,\\r\\nbut never greased. Roll the fondant into a ball; while still in the hand,\\r\\npress into the top an English walnut meat, or whatever decoration is\\r\\ndesired, and lay on paraffin paper to harden. Another class is made by\\r\\nusing a nut meat, say a blanched almond or pecan meat, a raisin, etc., as\\r\\ncenter, and rolling the fondant round it. The ball may be rolled in beaten\\r\\nwhite of egg and then in coarse white sugar. By using various centers, and\\r\\nornamenting the tops differently a great variety of bon-bons may be made;\\r\\nin fact, hundreds or even thousands can be worked out by changing the\\r\\nflavor, nuts, coloring, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChocolate Candies.--If the American girl had to be restricted to one class\\r\\nof candies, there would be little doubt she would profess a preference for\\r\\nthose prepared with chocolate.\\r\\n\\r\\n[CANDY MAKING 851]\\r\\n\\r\\nChocolate Creams.--To make chocolate creams, roll the fondant into balls\\r\\nof uniform size; let them stand on paraffin paper twenty-four hours or\\r\\nmore. Also coat nut meats, raisins, candied cherries, etc., with fondant.\\r\\nIn making a small quantity of chocolate dipped candies, get a small bowl\\r\\nthat will fit into the top of the teakettle; into this cut half a pound of\\r\\nunsweetened chocolate and a lump of paraffin as large as a black walnut,\\r\\nand let them melt; when smooth and well mixed let cool a little, and then\\r\\nset on a hot soapstone. Have ready a colander and a long darning needle.\\r\\nCover the bottom of the colander with paraffin paper, stick the point of\\r\\nthe needle into the piece to be dipped, immerse in the melted chocolate,\\r\\nlet it drip a moment, then push the eye of the needle through one of the\\r\\nholes in the colander, reach the other hand under and pull out the needle.\\r\\nThere then remains no disfiguring hole in the bottom of the cream. When\\r\\nthe colander is filled, lift the paper very, very carefully, and put in a\\r\\ncool place to harden. Unless the colander must be used again it is best to\\r\\nlet the creams stand in it to harden. Nut meats, white grapes, candied\\r\\ncherries and the like, may be dipped in the melted chocolates and coated\\r\\nlike the creams. If the chocolate gets too thick, thin it with a little\\r\\nolive oil or unsalted butter; not with water which will make it grain.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChocolate Creams. No. 2.--Put two cups of granulated sugar into half a cup\\r\\nof sweet cream. Boil five minutes from the time it begins to boil hard.\\r\\nSet the pan into cold water and stir in the flavoring, a teaspoonful of\\r\\nvanilla, usually. Stir until the candy is so stiff that stirring is\\r\\ndifficult; drop from a spoon on waxed paper; as it hardens, mould into\\r\\nballs, and dip in chocolate as above.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChocolate Candy, Plain.--Melt a square of unsweetened chocolate and stir\\r\\ninto plain fondant, flavoring generously with vanilla.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChocolate Caramels.--Put together over the fire one cup of molasses and\\r\\ntwo teacupfuls of sugar. Add a quarter of a pound of grated chocolate and\\r\\na piece of butter the size of an egg. Boil, without stirring, fifteen to\\r\\ntwenty minutes; pour into flat buttered dishes to a depth of one-third of\\r\\nan inch, and when nearly cold cut into squares. Wrap each in a square of\\r\\nparaffin paper.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChocolate Nut Caramels.--Boil together a cup of molasses, a cup of sugar\\r\\nand half a cup of sweet milk until a little hardens in cold water.

Use when quite fresh.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCocoanut Snow Balls.--Knead dessicated cocoanut into fondant; make into\\r\\nballs, and roll in grated cocoanut. Dessicated cocoanut may be used but is\\r\\nnot as good as grated cocoanut.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMAPLE CANDIES. Maple Creams.--Beat thoroughly one cup of the best maple\\r\\nsyrup and the while of one egg. With XXX confectioners\\' sugar, make it\\r\\ninto a stiff fondant or paste. Use as the centers for bon-bons, or make\\r\\ninto balls to be dipped into chocolate.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMaple Creams No. 2.--To two pounds of maple sugar add a cup of water and a\\r\\nquarter teaspoonful cream of tartar. Shave the sugar, and stir till\\r\\ndissolved. Boil without stirring to the soft ball stage; let stand in the\\r\\nkettle until cool, not cold; beat until creamy and pour into a shallow\\r\\nbuttered pan.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMaple Balls.--Boil without stirring, two cups of shaved maple sugar and a\\r\\ncup of water. At the hard ball stage add a heaping tablespoonful of good\\r\\nbutter. Beat till creamy. As soon as it can be handled form into balls and\\r\\npress the half of an English walnut or pecan on one side.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWAFERS.--To make wafers, boil without stirring two cups of granulated\\r\\nsugar, a half cup of water. When it will \"spin a thread\" set the kettle in\\r\\ncold water and beat till creamy. Flavor with peppermint, wintergreen,\\r\\ncinnamon, or any flavor you choose.

When brown, turn out of the mould, cut in cubes and wrap in oiled\\r\\npaper.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNut Bars.--Chop any kind of nutmeats you prefer, or a mixture of nuts,\\r\\nmoderately fine. Butter a shallow pan and spread the nuts evenly over the\\r\\nbottom. Boil one pound of granulated sugar with half a cup of water and a\\r\\npinch of cream of tartar till thick, but not too brittle. Pour over the\\r\\nnuts and set aside to cool. When it begins to harden mark into bars with a\\r\\nsharp knife. Let stand several days, when it becomes soft and delicious.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNut Loaf.--Chop nutmeats into small pieces and work into fondant. Make\\r\\ninto a roll, and after standing a day or two, cut into slices. Chopped\\r\\ndates, figs and raisins may be used in the same way.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPeanut Candy.--Carefully remove the shells and brown skins from roasted\\r\\npeanuts. Put them an inch thick in a buttered pan. Boil a pound of crushed\\r\\nloaf sugar with three gills of water and a salt spoon of cream of tartar\\r\\n(to prevent graining) dissolved in water, to the caramel stage. The\\r\\ninstant the sugar reaches that point, shown by its beginning to brown, it\\r\\nmust be removed from the fire and the pan set in cold water to check the\\r\\nboiling; then pour over the nuts.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPop Corn Candy.--Boil two cups of sugar, two tablespoonfuls of butter and\\r\\na cup of water until it threads. Stir in four quarts of nice popped corn,\\r\\nrejecting all hard kernels, take from the fire and stir till cool. Make\\r\\ninto balls.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPopcorn Baskets.--Prepare the corn as above, instead of making into balls,\\r\\nbutter the bottoms of tumblers and press the candy around them to form\\r\\nlittle baskets, in which ice cream may be served or which may be filled\\r\\nwith candies.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSour Drops.--Strain the juice of three or four large lemons into a bowl,\\r\\nand stir in powdered loaf sugar till it is quite thick. Put into a pan and\\r\\nlet boil five minutes, stirring constantly. Drop from the end of a spoon\\r\\nupon writing paper, and when dry keep in tin cannisters. Tartaric acid is\\r\\ngenerally used by commercial candy makers, but is much more injurious to\\r\\nhealth.\\r\\n\\r\\n[854 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\nCrystallized Fruits.--Other Candies.--Boil two cups of granulated sugar\\r\\nwith two-thirds of a cup of water until it hardens in cold water, do not\\r\\nstir. When it is brittle without being sticky, it is ready to use. Dip the\\r\\nfruit to be candied, sections of oranges, white grapes, cherries, squares\\r\\nof pineapple, etc., into this, and lay on paraffin paper. Dip a second\\r\\ntime after the first has hardened, to ensure a good coat. Use the same\\r\\nrule for the syrup to glace nuts.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCream Dates.--Remove the stones from nice dates. Replace them with the\\r\\nroll of flavored fondant. Or roll a blanched almond in fondant and stuff\\r\\nthe date with it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHoarhound Candy.--Boil the hoarhound in a little water till the strength\\r\\nis extracted. Make a sugar syrup, adding the hoarhound to it; let it boil\\r\\nup and stir against the sides of the pan until it thickens. Pour out on\\r\\nparaffin paper dusted with fine sugar, and cut into squares.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMarshmallows.--Dissolve over a slow fire eight ounces of best gum arabic\\r\\nin three gills of water. Boil one ounce of marshmallow roots in a little\\r\\nwater for half an hour. Strain, and boil down. Put this and the gum arabic\\r\\nsolution with half a pound of loaf sugar, let it cook slowly till it makes\\r\\na paste that can be rolled between the fingers to the \"soft ball\" stage.\\r\\nThen add the beaten whites of two eggs; when well mixed pour in a pan\\r\\nwhich should be lined with white paper, with enough projecting over the\\r\\nsides so that as the mixture cools it can be lifted out and cut in cups\\r\\nwith a sharp knife, then rolled in powdered sugar.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMarrons Glaces.--Remove the shells from a quart of large Italian or French\\r\\nchestnuts. Let stand fifteen minutes in boiling water. Drain; rub off the\\r\\nskin; cover again with boiling water and simmer gently half an hour or\\r\\ntill tender, but not soft. Drain in a sieve. Boil together one cup of\\r\\ngranulated sugar and one cup of water; add the nuts and simmer until they\\r\\nbegin to look clear. Make another syrup of one pound of granulated sugar\\r\\nand one cup of water; boil till it will spin a thread, add a teaspoonful\\r\\nof lemon juice and set aside till it cools a little; then beat till it\\r\\nbegins to turn white. Set in a basin of hot water, flavor with vanilla,\\r\\nand when melted to a syrup, dip each nut. When coated, lay on paraffin\\r\\npaper to dry. These sugared chestnuts are highly esteemed as a sweetmeat\\r\\nand are expensive to buy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nStick Candy.--Three pounds of granulated sugar, two cups of water, one\\r\\nteaspoonful of cream of tartar dissolved in a little warm water. Stir over\\r\\nthe fire till the sugar is dissolved; cover the kettle while the syrup is\\r\\nboiling and skim carefully a few drops.

Then add one teaspoonful of vanilla, half a cup of chopped\\r\\nnutmeats, and five cents worth of dates, cut up with the scissors. Pour\\r\\nupon oiled paper in a flat pan and cut in squares. Those who eat this\\r\\ncandy will ask to have it made again.\\r\\n\\r\\nA Few Hints.--Many candy makers consider coffee A sugar, better than the\\r\\ngranulated, as being purer. Choose a sugar that is dry, uniform in quality\\r\\nand with hard, sparkling crystals. Cane sugar is greatly to be preferred\\r\\nover beet sugar. When you can, let the sugar and water stand together for\\r\\nsome time. The syrup may be stirred until it reaches the boiling point,\\r\\nbut not afterward. Unless otherwise specified, cook over a hot fire. The\\r\\nsyrup passes quickly from one degree to another and must be tested often\\r\\nand carefully. Cream of tartar must be dissolved in a little warm water\\r\\nbefore being put into the syrup. So also must soda. If you use nuts, be\\r\\ncareful to remove every particle of shell and skin before putting them\\r\\ninto the syrup. Almonds are blanched by letting them stand in boiling\\r\\nwater for a few minutes and then nipping off the skins between the\\r\\nfingers. They should be warmed in the oven before being put into the\\r\\nsyrup. Dessicated cocoanut should be steamed a few minutes before being\\r\\nused; put in a dish in a colander over boiling water. Use the fresh\\r\\ncocoanut if you can get it. Bonbons made of fondant are probably the\\r\\neasiest form of candy making for the amateur to attempt, and the most\\r\\ninteresting on account of the variety possible through the use of other\\r\\nmaterials in combination.\\r\\n\\r\\n[858 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES ]\\r\\n\\r\\nOVER THREE HUNDRED\\r\\nMISCELLANEOUS RECIPES\\r\\n\\r\\nA GOLD MINE OF INFORMATION FOR\\r\\nPROGRESSIVE HOUSEWIVES\\r\\n\\r\\nHOUSEKEEPERS\\' ALPHABET.\\r\\n\\r\\nApples.--Keep in a dry place, as cool as possible, without freezing.\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooms.--Hang in the cellarway to keep soft and pliant.\\r\\n\\r\\nCranberries.--Keep under water in cellar; change water monthly.\\r\\n\\r\\nDish of hot water set in oven prevents cake from scorching.\\r\\n\\r\\nEconomize health, time, and means and you will never beg.\\r\\n\\r\\nFlour.--Keep cool, dry and securely covered.\\r\\n\\r\\nGlass.--Clean with a quart of water mixed with a tablespoonful of ammonia.\\r\\n\\r\\nHerbs.--Gather when beginning to blossom; keep in paper sacks.\\r\\n\\r\\nInk Stains.--Wet with spirits of turpentine; after three hours, rub well.\\r\\n\\r\\nJars.--To prevent, coax husband to your will rather than order him.\\r\\n\\r\\nKeep an account of all supplies with cost and date when purchased.\\r\\n\\r\\nLove lightens labor.\\r\\n\\r\\nMoney.--Count carefully when you receive change.\\r\\n\\r\\nNutmegs.--Prick with a pin and if good oil will run out.\\r\\n\\r\\nOrange and Lemon Peel.--Dry, pound and keep in corked bottles.\\r\\n\\r\\nParsnips.--Keep in ground until spring.\\r\\n\\r\\nQuicksilver and white of an egg destroys bedbugs.\\r\\n\\r\\nRice.--Select the large, with a clear fresh look; old rice may have\\r\\ninsects.\\r\\n\\r\\nSugar.--For family use, the granulated is the best.\\r\\n\\r\\nTea.--Equal parts Japan and green are as good as English breakfast.\\r\\n\\r\\nUse a cement made of ashes, salt and water for cracks in stove.\\r\\n\\r\\nVariety is the best culinary spice.\\r\\n\\r\\nWatch your back yard for dirt and bones.\\r\\n\\r\\nXantippe was a scold.

Charcoal to Prevent Rust.--Charcoal absorbs all dampness, for which\\r\\nreason it should be kept in boxes with silverware to prevent rust.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. A Needle Holder.--A guest of ours kept all her needles in a bottle in\\r\\nwhich was a pinch or two of emery. She said that it keeps them always\\r\\nbright and free from rust, and she finds it much easier to pick out the\\r\\nneedle she wants from the bottle than from a tray.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Care of a Scrubbing Brush.--Scrubbing brushes should never be put away\\r\\nwith their bristles upward, for thus the water would soak into the wooden\\r\\npart and the bristles would soon become loose.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. In Case of Sickness.--In our home, when hot cloths are needed wet ones\\r\\nare put in a steamer, and water kept boiling underneath. In this way the\\r\\ncloths are more easily handled and can be applied as hot as needed.\\r\\n\\r\\n5. To Tighten Cane-Seated Chair Bottoms.--Cane-seated chair bottoms that\\r\\nhave sagged may be made as tight as ever by washing them with hot water\\r\\nand leaving them to dry in the open air.\\r\\n\\r\\n6. For Chilblains.--To relieve the chilblains bathe the feet in warm water\\r\\nat night, then rub them with castor oil. This method will cure very bad\\r\\ncases.\\r\\n\\r\\n7. Paint, Smoked by Kerosene Lamps.--Paint that has been smoked by\\r\\nkerosene lamps may be cleaned with kerosene, which can afterward be rubbed\\r\\noff with a clean brush.\\r\\n\\r\\n8. A Use for Sacks.--Save all salt and sugar sacks; wash and boil them and\\r\\nthey can be put to various uses. Salt sacks are nice to strain jellies\\r\\nthrough; are also nice to bake veal or beef loaf in. Sugar sacks make nice\\r\\ndish-towels.\\r\\n\\r\\n9. Soap With Stove Blacking.--Use a half bar of laundry soap, and one cake\\r\\nof blacking. Put in an old kettle with three quarts of water. Boil down\\r\\nuntil thick. This will last a year.\\r\\n\\r\\n10. To Remove White Spots from Tables.--Wring cloths out of very hot\\r\\nwater, lay them over spot and remove quickly. Repeat if necessary. When\\r\\ndry, rub the furniture with some of the good polish.\\r\\n\\r\\n11. To Clean Mirrors.--To clean a French mirror which has grown dull, rub\\r\\nwith a cloth soaked in alcohol; follow this by rubbing with a dry cloth.\\r\\nThe dullness will vanish, and the mirror will look like new. This method\\r\\nis used for cut glass with excellent result.\\r\\n\\r\\n12. To Whiten Linen.--If you want your table linen to last do not use\\r\\nbleaching preparations. Use only clean soap and soft water. If the water\\r\\nis not soft, add a little ammonia.\\r\\n\\r\\n13. Velveteen for Polishing Cloths.--Old pieces of velveteen that have\\r\\nserved their original purpose should be saved for polishing cloths. They\\r\\nwill answer perfectly the purpose of chamois and save buying anything\\r\\nfresh. When soiled the cloths may be washed in soapy water and dried in\\r\\nthe open air.\\r\\n\\r\\n[858 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\n14. For Clearing Vinegar.--Should your home-made vinegar refuse to settle,\\r\\ntry this: To each gallon stir in a half pint of fresh milk and let stand\\r\\nundisturbed for twenty-four hours. The milk will form a curd at the\\r\\nbottom and all the dregs will settle with it, leaving the vinegar clear.\\r\\nPour off very carefully.\\r\\n\\r\\n15. Uses for Old Velvet.--A bit of velvet is a fine polisher for brass. It\\r\\nquickly removes the dust from woodwork, or shoes soiled from walking which\\r\\ndo not need reblacking. For dusting a felt hat there is nothing better\\r\\nthan a piece of chiffon velvet. It is also good to keep the bottom of a\\r\\nsilk skirt free from the dirt. One housekeeper even uses a big piece of\\r\\nold velvet to rub her stove to a high polish after it has been blackened.\\r\\n\\r\\n16. Removing Warts.--Warts can be removed permanently and safely by an\\r\\napplication of a salve made by mixing common table salt into a yolk of an\\r\\negg. Change the application daily, and within the week they will all drop\\r\\nout.\\r\\n\\r\\n17. To Save Time by Sewing.--When sewing on plain garments, cut out\\r\\nseveral garments at a time, and save time by stitching all the straight\\r\\nseams, then doing all the basting, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\n18. To Remove Stains from Blankets.--Stains on blankets and other woolen\\r\\nmaterials may be removed by using a mixture of equal parts of glycerin and\\r\\na yolk of an egg. Spread it on the stain, let it stay for half an hour or\\r\\nmore, then wash out.\\r\\n\\r\\n19. Burn from Acid or Lye.--In case of a burn with carbolic acid or lye,\\r\\nthe speedy application of sweet oil or olive oil will give almost instant\\r\\nrelief.\\r\\n\\r\\n20. To Wash Laces.--To wash delicate or tender laces put the lace in a\\r\\nfruit jar with shavings of some good soap, cover with warm water, let soak\\r\\nfor awhile then shake, using if necessary several waters, then rinse in\\r\\nsame manner, spread between pieces of muslin and roll up on a bottle or\\r\\njar, and leave to dry. They will not be torn in this way and will look\\r\\nlike new.\\r\\n\\r\\n21. For Cut or Bruise.--Bind sugar and turpentine on the wound or bruise\\r\\nat once. The healing properties of this simple remedy cannot be surpassed.\\r\\n\\r\\n22. Lemons; How to Obtain More Juice.--Lemons placed in a moderately hot\\r\\noven, for a few minutes will yield a greater quantity of juice than if\\r\\nused in the ordinary way.\\r\\n\\r\\n23. Whipping Cream.--If cream does not whip well, add to it the white of\\r\\nan egg, and the result will be very satisfactory.\\r\\n\\r\\n24. To Clean Lamp Burners.--To remove the black gummy coating which\\r\\nsometimes comes on the brass parts of lamp burners, moisten the cloth with\\r\\ncommon household ammonia, rub it on sapolio, and apply it to the coated\\r\\nsurface with the aid of a little elbow grease. A bright brassy surface\\r\\nwill soon appear.\\r\\n\\r\\n[MISCELLANEOUS RECIPES 859]\\r\\n\\r\\n25. To Preserve Hot Water Bottle.--Fill with air, cork tightly, and hang\\r\\nin a cool dry place. This keeps the walls of the bottle from coming in\\r\\ncontact with each other and prevents deterioration and decay.\\r\\n\\r\\n26. Sweep Stairs with Paint Brush.--My mother uses a paint brush with long\\r\\nbristles for sweeping her stairs. With its use the work is more quickly\\r\\nand thoroughly done than by the old way, because the bristles reach every\\r\\ncorner and crack as a cloth cannot do.\\r\\n\\r\\n27. Washing Hair Brushes.--To wash hair brushes take a piece of washing\\r\\nsoda, dissolve it in warm water, and stand the brush in it, taking care\\r\\nthat the water covers only the bristles. It will almost instantly become\\r\\nclean and white. Place it in the air to dry, bristles downward, and it\\r\\nwill be as firm as a new brush.\\r\\n\\r\\n28. Loops on Towels.--Always have a loop on each end of the kitchen towel,\\r\\nwhere a roller is not used. Otherwise all the soil and the wear come on\\r\\nthe lower end.\\r\\n\\r\\n29. Changing Pillow Slips.--To change pillow slips without scattering the\\r\\nfeathers all over the house, sew up the clean tick, all except a space of\\r\\nabout twelve inches. Take the full pillow unopened and baste one side of\\r\\nthe empty one to the full one. Then with a knife slit open the seam of the\\r\\npillow, the twelve-inch space. Quickly baste the other sides together so\\r\\nthey will not come apart easily. Then slowly push the feathers into the\\r\\nclean and empty tick, and when finished undo the basting and sew tightly.\\r\\nSoak the soiled ticks in cold water immediately to remove remaining\\r\\nfeathers.\\r\\n\\r\\n30. Use of Old Linen Collars.--Cut them up into narrow strips and use them\\r\\nfor gas-lighting instead of using wax tapers. They make a steady flame\\r\\nand do not drip grease.\\r\\n\\r\\n31. Discarded Toys.--My baby came in the other day hugging to his breast a\\r\\ntoy tin goat. It was evidently one of the discarded playthings of a\\r\\nneighbor\\'s child. On inquiry I found that the toy had been given to my\\r\\nboy, and he has taken so much pleasure in this castoff plaything that I\\r\\nhave been saving his old toys and passing them on to other children of the\\r\\nneighborhood. I have discovered that in their baby hearts these are as\\r\\ngood as new, because they have never played with them. It is nothing to\\r\\nthem that they are not just out of the store.\\r\\n\\r\\n32. To Clean Silver.--Try curdled milk for cleaning your silverware. Let\\r\\nthe silver stand for several hours in the milk, and you will be surprised\\r\\nat the result.\\r\\n\\r\\n33. Removing Stains.--Damp salt will remove egg stains from silver and tea\\r\\nstains from cups.\\r\\n\\r\\n34. To Keep Free from Mould.--Jelly and jam can be kept entirely free from\\r\\nmould by pouring a thin layer of melted paraffin on top. This paraffin can\\r\\nbe saved when the jelly is taken from the glass and used the next season\\r\\nso the cost is very small.\\r\\n\\r\\n[860 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\n35. Hanging Out Clothes.--The other day I came across a peculiar clothes\\r\\nbar. It was the same as any other, except that the crossbars had been\\r\\nremoved, and for them ropes had been substituted. The owner told me she\\r\\nhad had her husband fix it for her the previous winter when she was\\r\\nbothered with salt rheum. \"I hang up all the baby\\'s little things,\\r\\nfastening them with clothespins, right here in the house where it is\\r\\nwarm,\" she explained. \"Then it is but the work of a moment to take the\\r\\nwhole thing out of doors, and there is no fishing around for the tiny\\r\\nthings when my hands are so cold they feel as though they would drop off.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n36. A Fine Cutting Board.--I measured the top of my kitchen cabinet, and\\r\\nhad a piece of zinc cut to fit it, allowing an inch for turning over the\\r\\nedges. My husband tacked it on, and I can cut meat and bread or anything\\r\\non it, without harming it in the least, besides using it as a moulding\\r\\nboard.\\r\\n\\r\\n37. Convenient Place for Stiletto.--It will be found a great convenience\\r\\nto have the stiletto tied to the embroidery hoop by a ribbon about a foot\\r\\nlong, when that little instrument is necessary for the work in hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n38. Cleaning Paint and Varnish.--Many housekeepers have been annoyed by\\r\\nfinding their paint and varnish brushes dry and hard. To soften them, heat\\r\\nto the boiling water point some good cider vinegar, immerse your brushes\\r\\nand allow them to simmer in it for a few minutes, then wash out in strong\\r\\nsoapsuds and your brushes will be soft and pliable.\\r\\n\\r\\n39. How to Keep Cookies from Burning.--To keep cookies from burning on the\\r\\nbottom, turn the baking pan upside down and bake on the bottom of the pan.\\r\\n\\r\\n40. Non-Sticking Cake Tins.--Cake layers will not stick in cooking if a\\r\\nlittle meal is scorched on the cake tins and rubbed off with paper.\\r\\n\\r\\n41. To Clean Sieve.--Hold a sieve which has been used for straining\\r\\noatmeal, tomatoes, fruit, etc., at once under the faucet, or shake it in\\r\\nenough water to cover it, then slap it, and it is easily cleaned; if it\\r\\ndries first it is almost impossible to get it clean even by more time and\\r\\neffort.\\r\\n\\r\\n42. Washing Clothes.--After the clothes have been soaked a while to loosen\\r\\nthe dirt, spread on washboard, soap, and then rub with a common scrub\\r\\nbrush. The dirt comes out easier and with much less wear on the clothes.\\r\\nEven when the washing machine is used, this is a help for the wrist bands\\r\\nthat are not quite clean.\\r\\n\\r\\n43. Discoveries.--When old clothes, like worn-out aprons or waists or\\r\\nlinings come to hand, and are absolutely good for nothing else, cut them\\r\\ninto small pieces, say eight or twelve inches square, some larger, and put\\r\\nthem into a bag or box easily accessible. Then when something is spilled\\r\\nover on stove or floor, or mess of any kind is made, use these bits for\\r\\ncleaning up and drop them into the fire.\\r\\n\\r\\n[MISCELLANEOUS RECIPES 861]\\r\\n\\r\\n44. To Stretch Curtains.--Take curtains while wet and put on a curtain\\r\\nrod; also put a heavy rod as a weight on the lower hem. Hang one on\\r\\ncurtain at a time at an open window and stretch the desired width.\\r\\n\\r\\n45. Cleaning Windows in the Winter.--It is a hard task in the winter time\\r\\nto wash windows in the old way, but if it is very cold, windows can be\\r\\ncleaned by using \"Bon Ami,\" The same is useful for cleaning bright pieces\\r\\non stoves.\\r\\n\\r\\n46. How to Kill Black Ants.--A request for information as to how to rid\\r\\nplants and trees of black ants, which was received at the Pennsylvania\\r\\ndepartment of agriculture\\'s division of zoology, elicited the following\\r\\nfrom Prof. H. A. Surface, State Zoologist. You can do this by finding the\\r\\nnesting places of the pests and making holes into the interior of them\\r\\nwith a sharpened stick like a broom handle and pouring into each hole a\\r\\nhalf tea cup of carbon bisulphide. Fill the hole with earth and cover with\\r\\na wet cloth or blanket to keep down the fumes and the ants will be\\r\\ndestroyed at once. This is the best possible method for destroying ants of\\r\\nany kind.\\r\\n\\r\\n47. Washing Windows.--It is better to wash windows on a cloudy day or when\\r\\nthe sun is not shining directly on them. Before washing, dust them\\r\\nthoroughly inside and out, then wash the woodwork without touching the\\r\\nglass. For the glass use warm water, to which add a tablespoonful of\\r\\nkerosene to each pailful of water used. Dry with a cloth or chamois skin,\\r\\nwrung very dry; then polish with a soft cloth or soft old newspapers.\\r\\n\\r\\n48. Home-made Soap Shaker.--A baking powder can with holes punctured in\\r\\nboth cover and bottom, makes a fine soap shaker. Put all the small scraps\\r\\nof soap in this, and when you wash dishes, just put box and all in your\\r\\ndishpan and shake about. You will have a nice suds and no soap rubbing off\\r\\non the dishes.\\r\\n\\r\\n49. Cleaning Rugs.--When cleaning rugs first lay them out straight and\\r\\nbrush with a stiff dry scrubbing brush. You will be surprised at the\\r\\namount of dirt that is loosened and comes out in this way.\\r\\n\\r\\n50. Clean Leather Furniture.--A good way to clean leather furniture is to\\r\\nadd a little vinegar to some warm water and wash the leather, using a\\r\\nclean soft cloth. Wipe with a dry cloth. To restore the polish, mix two\\r\\nteaspoonfuls of turpentine with the whites of two eggs; beat a little and\\r\\napply with a soft flannel cloth. Dry with another cloth and rub well.\\r\\n\\r\\n51. Ironing Board, Conveniences for.--Try tacking a pocket on the under\\r\\nside of your ironing board to keep your holder, stand and sheet of sand\\r\\npaper in.\\r\\n\\r\\n52. Clean Gilt Furniture.--Gilt furniture can be cleaned with sifted\\r\\nwhiting made into a cream with alcohol. Cover a small space at a time and\\r\\nrub off before it hardens. To clean brass fixtures rub them with cut lemon\\r\\nand then wash off in hot water.\\r\\n\\r\\n[862 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\n53. For Tufted Furniture.--For tufted furniture use a bicycle pump to\\r\\nremove dust. Garments to be stored for the summer months should first be\\r\\naired well on a bright breezy day. Brush thoroughly and shake free of\\r\\ndust. Do not leave clothing out in the air after three o\\'clock in the\\r\\nafternoon, as from that time until dark all sorts of insects are seeking\\r\\ntheir beds. A trunk or box that has been thoroughly cleaned and sunned and\\r\\nthen lined with fresh newspapers will prove an ideal place in which to\\r\\nstore winter clothing. Sprinkle each layer with cloves and tuck newspapers\\r\\nwell around them, moths detest printer\\'s ink.\\r\\n\\r\\n54. Clean Linoleum.--To clean linoleum add one cupful of beeswax, shaved\\r\\nfine, to two cupfuls of turpentine and set on the back of the stove to\\r\\nmelt. When cool it will be thick and ready for use. First thoroughly clean\\r\\nthe linoleum and then apply the paste with a soft cloth. Rub in well, then\\r\\npolish with a dry cloth, preferably flannel. Linoleum treated in this\\r\\nmanner will look like new.\\r\\n\\r\\n55. For Broken Needles.--A receptacle for broken needles in her work\\r\\nbasket would be a boon to any woman, and this one which I am about to\\r\\ndescribe is very easily made, takes up little space and is really very\\r\\nconvenient, when one is busy sewing and dislikes to get up to take care of\\r\\nthe dangerous bits of steel. Take a little two dram bottle (homeopathic\\r\\nstyle), crochet for it a snug covering made of embroidery silk or\\r\\nsilkaline, crocheting it tightly and covering the bottle completely, using\\r\\nsome bright color if desired. When you break a needle just slip the pieces\\r\\nright through the meshes of silk into the bottle; they will go in easily,\\r\\nbut the holes will close up after them, retaining them in safety till the\\r\\nreceptacle is full.\\r\\n\\r\\n56. How to Carry House Key.--The pocketless woman often finds it\\r\\ntroublesome to carry a key, especially the house key, when she goes out.\\r\\nIf an old-fashioned split metal ring can be found, use it to connect the\\r\\nkey to be carried to the circular end of a strong, sure acting safety pin,\\r\\nnot necessarily of the largest size. If such a ring cannot be found,\\r\\nfasten pin and key together with a bit of fine wire, string or thread will\\r\\nbe sure to break just at the wrong time. Then the pin may be fastened to\\r\\nthe inside of the jacket or slipped inside of the shirtwaist band pinned\\r\\nto the undergarment, or attached to the skirtband and allowed to hang down\\r\\noutside.\\r\\n\\r\\n57. A Sewing Room Hint.--Thread will not become knotted so often if the\\r\\nnewly-cut end is put into the needle instead of the other end, which is\\r\\nalready broken.\\r\\n\\r\\n58. Convenient Addition to Kitchen.--One of the most highly-prized helps\\r\\nin our kitchen is a bird cage hook, one which can be hung on a nail, and\\r\\nthus easily changed from place to place. On this when placed over the\\r\\nsink, I hang macaroni, greens, etc., to drain; and when placed over the\\r\\nkitchen table, it is an ideal arrangement for holding the jelly bag.\\r\\n\\r\\n[MISCELLANEOUS RECIPES 863]\\r\\n\\r\\n59. To Remove Candle Grease.--A simple way to remove candle grease is to\\r\\nscrape off all that will come off in that way, lay over the spot a piece\\r\\nof heavy brown wrapping paper (butcher\\'s paper) and press with a very hot\\r\\niron.\\r\\n\\r\\n60. Using Silk on the Machine.--When sewing on the machine with silk, it\\r\\noften unwinds and twists around the spool spindle in a very trying manner.\\r\\nTo avoid this make a hole in a small piece of felt and slip it on the\\r\\nspindle before the silk is put on.\\r\\n\\r\\n61. A Shoe Cover.--When packing my trunk for a journey, I have found it to\\r\\nbe a good scheme to use my stockings for shoe covers, this saves the added\\r\\nbulk of paper, and the shoes will be found less liable to muss up other\\r\\nthings if protected by this clean and handy stocking covering. A stocking\\r\\noccupies practically no room when drawn over a shoe, and the two together\\r\\nwill be found quite handy to tuck into chinks into which they alone can\\r\\nfall.\\r\\n\\r\\n62. To Press Skirts.--An easy way to press skirts is to use a sheet of\\r\\npaper in place of a cloth; lay the folds, or plaits and in place of\\r\\nironing over a wet cloth take a sheet of common magazine paper lay it on\\r\\nthe goods and iron. This presses the skirt very well and keeps the shine\\r\\noff and will, I think, give more satisfaction than if pressed with a damp\\r\\ncloth or ironed on the wrong side.\\r\\n\\r\\n63. How to Attach Holders to Kitchen Apron.--Pin two holders with long\\r\\ntape at each side of the apron when cooking. They are convenient for\\r\\nhandling hot kettles or dishes.\\r\\n\\r\\n64. To Pack Music.--An excellent place in which to pack away sheets of\\r\\nmusic that are not in constant use is a large box fitted with a hinged\\r\\ncover and upholstered in cretonne, after the manner of shirtwaist boxes so\\r\\nmuch in vogue. Such a box is kept in the hallway of a small flat, where\\r\\nroom is at a premium. The music cabinet was full to overflowing and there\\r\\nwas no closet shelf that could be utilized, as so often happens in an\\r\\nordinary house. An unused shirtwaist box was suggested and has been found\\r\\nto answer every purpose, besides providing an extra seat when such a seat\\r\\nwas desirable. The box seems to fit in as an article of furnishing and the\\r\\nreason for its being there would never be asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n65. Pie Crust, How to Bake.--Bake empty pie crusts on the outside of the\\r\\ntin, instead of the inside, and they won\\'t shrink.\\r\\n\\r\\n66. Let the Poison Bottle Tinkle.--A wise house mother with half a dozen\\r\\nlittle folk needing all sorts of medicines and medical applications, has\\r\\npurchased in a toy shop a handful of little bells, and when a bottle\\r\\ncontaining poison is added to the medicine closet it is adorned with a\\r\\nbell tied around its neck with a narrow ribbon. No danger with the bottle\\r\\nthus equipped of taking by mistake, in the dark, the dangerous medicine.\\r\\nThe moment the poison bottle is touched the little bell tinkles its\\r\\nwarning.\\r\\n\\r\\n[864 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\n67. A New Night Lamp.--Mothers who have timid little ones will appreciate\\r\\nthe new night lamp, the apparatus of which may be carried to the country\\r\\nin a trunk or handbag. This apparatus consists of a small wooden float\\r\\nthrough which passes a tiny wick. An ordinary china teacup is half filled\\r\\nwith cottonseed oil, the little floating wick placed in this, and a match\\r\\ntouched to the upright wick. While the sides of the cup prevent thc direct\\r\\nlight of the flame being visible to the person in bed, a pleasant dim\\r\\nlight is cast over the room.\\r\\n\\r\\n68. Time Saved in Sewing.--In a family of small children there are a great\\r\\nmany buttonholes to be made. A quick way to make them in the everyday\\r\\nunderwear, is on the sewing machine. Sew back and forth, leaving a small\\r\\nspace in the center, three or four times where the buttonhole is wanted,\\r\\nand cut in the space left, being careful not to cut the stitching. In\\r\\nmaking little dresses, or slips after the skirts are sewed up, attach the\\r\\ngatherer to the machine and gather the top and bottom of sleeves and\\r\\nskirt. In this way work is quickly done.\\r\\n\\r\\n69. Stews and Hash, How to Make.--Stews and hash made of fresh meat or\\r\\nround steak instead of scraps, are delicious. When the steak is to be used\\r\\nwithout being ground, select only tender, young, pinkish pieces; otherwise\\r\\nit will be tough in spite of prolonged cooking.\\r\\n\\r\\n70. Dusters.--Another good idea about dusters. Do not use anything that\\r\\ncomes handy, but get squares of five-cent cheese cloth or silkoline, fold\\r\\na neat hem, and whip it nicely around, then turn and go back the other\\r\\nway. These materials are the best one can use, as they do not leave lint\\r\\nbehind. Always wash the dusters after the sweeping day. No one can do\\r\\nclean work with soiled tools; besides dusters ruin the hands.\\r\\n\\r\\n71. Broom Bags.--Good material for a broom bag or cover is old gauze\\r\\nunderwear. The goods takes up dust very readily, and is easily rinsed out;\\r\\nor a piece can be thrown away without waste.\\r\\n\\r\\n72. To Settle Coffee.--An economical and satisfactory way to settle coffee\\r\\nis as follows: Beat one egg well with an egg beater and pour over one\\r\\npound of freshly-ground coffee, mix very thoroughly and no trace of\\r\\ndampness then remains. The coffee may then be put away as usual, and when\\r\\nused it will be found as clear as amber.\\r\\n\\r\\n73. Stocking Tops for Convenient Holders.--For soft, convenient holders\\r\\nuse old stocking tops. Take two thicknesses, cut in squares, bind all\\r\\naround with some bias pieces left from calico dresses and sew a brass ring\\r\\non one corner.\\r\\n\\r\\n74. Hat Hangers.--It is often convenient to hang up hats, even\\r\\n\"Sunday-go-to-meeting ones.\" To make sure that everyone will stay hung\\r\\nup, and not fall to the floor to be soiled or crushed under foot, sew a\\r\\nloop of narrow ribbon or elastic braid or even shoestring, to the middle\\r\\nof the lining, making the loop long enough so that it will reach to the\\r\\nedge of the hat crown when the loop is pulled out. This can be done and\\r\\npassed over hook or nail or peg, and the hat hung over it, and even if the\\r\\nhat gets a hard knock, it\\'s a case of \"sure on\" every time.\\r\\n\\r\\n[MISCELLANEOUS RECIPES 865]\\r\\n\\r\\n75. To Freshen Bread.--To freshen bread pour cold water all over the loaf,\\r\\ndrain quickly, and place in the oven. When the outside is dry and hot\\r\\nremove the loaf and it can scarcely be detected from a new one.\\r\\n\\r\\n76. Renewing Wringer Rollers.--A neighbor rejuvenated a worn-out wringer\\r\\nthe other day by covering the rolls with white felt. She cut the felt so\\r\\nthat it would just come together, not overlap anywhere, and caught the\\r\\nedges together with close stitches. It bids fair to last her as long\\r\\nagain, and it is certain that just now the wringer does as good work as\\r\\nany new one.\\r\\n\\r\\n77. To Prevent Cake Tins Sticking.--Flour the baking tins after greasing\\r\\nthem. If the flour is shaken all over the grease, and the tins rapped, you\\r\\nwill have no difficulty with sticky cakes which break when you try to get\\r\\nthem out. Lard is just as good as butter, for it will not taste through\\r\\nthe flour.\\r\\n\\r\\n78. Substitute for Chopping Bowl.--When chopping mincemeat, tomatoes, or\\r\\nlarge quantities of other fruit, you will probably find that your chopping\\r\\nbowl is a good deal too small.

Save the Gas.--Cut strips of asbestos paper an inch and a half wide\\r\\nand long enough to go around the burners of the gas range.

Have a tiny cupboard\\r\\nwith tight closing door, or a well-fitted curtain, and there is gain in\\r\\nlooks and convenience.\\r\\n\\r\\n82. To Prevent Tablecloths from Blowing Off.--We had some pieces of brass\\r\\nchain, and found them splendid to run through the hems of the tablecovers\\r\\nwhen in use on the porch in summer. Such \"loaded\" covers do not blow off\\r\\neasily, consequently they save quite a bit of annoyance and laundering.\\r\\n\\r\\n83. To Mark Poison Bottle.--When you purchase a bottle of poison run a\\r\\nbrass-headed tack into the top of the cork. It serves as a marker, and\\r\\nchildren will be more cautious of the marked bottle.

To Prevent Starch from Boiling Over.--Add a small piece of butter the\\r\\nsize of a walnut when the starch comes to a good boil. This not only gives\\r\\na nice, smooth finish and makes the ironing easier, but it prevents the\\r\\nstarch from boiling over.\\r\\n\\r\\n89. To Hold Sheets in Place.--I worked out a little scheme which has saved\\r\\nme a lot of trouble and inconvenience, so I thought I would pass it on.\\r\\nThe sheets and bed clothes are constantly pulling out at the foot, so one\\r\\nday I sewed three buttons on to my mattress with strong thread, and worked\\r\\nbuttonholes in the hems of the sheets to correspond, and since then have\\r\\nnot had trouble with their pulling up in the middle of the night.\\r\\n\\r\\n90. Hints for Bathing the Baby.--It is a great advantage when bathing the\\r\\nbaby to have all the towels heated before using, as they absorb the\\r\\nmoisture much more readily and are very pleasant and soothing to the\\r\\ndelicate skin. This is also excellent for bathing an invalid as it greatly\\r\\nhastens the work and lessens the danger of catching cold. It acts like a\\r\\ncharm for the child who dreads a bath, this is usually a nervous child who\\r\\ndoes not like the feeling of the towel, on the wet surface of its skin;\\r\\ncomplains of feeling damp; and refuses to don its clothing when a less\\r\\nsensitive child would be perfectly comfortable.\\r\\n\\r\\n91. A Satisfactory Shoe Polisher.--Not long since I ripped up a velvet\\r\\ncovered hat, only to find the velvet impossible for further use in the\\r\\nmillinery line. A threw it into the big waste basket that stands near my\\r\\nhusband\\'s shoe cleaning apparatus. He caught up the velvet in a hurry one\\r\\nday to take a spot off a shoe, and now has it laid away as a treasure in\\r\\nhis shoe kit. He says it is the best polisher he ever had, and uses it on\\r\\nmy fine shoes to his own entire satisfaction.\\r\\n\\r\\n92.

A page or two is devoted to each month\\'s\\r\\nuse. The month and year are entered at the top of page. When groceries are\\r\\npurchased, the date, article and price are noted, and summed up at the end\\r\\nof each month. It makes a handy, permanent record, showing how long\\r\\nsupplies last, the expense of one month compared with another, and the\\r\\nmonthly average of each year.\\r\\n\\r\\n96. A Brick Pincushion.--A brick pincushion was a dressmaker\\'s ingenious\\r\\nway of making easy work of basting and sewing long seams. She took a\\r\\ncommon red brick, topped it with a flat oblong cushion size and shape of\\r\\nthe brick, covering the whole neatly with a bright chintz cover. This\\r\\nstanding on the edge of her cutting table was in constant use, and proved\\r\\na great convenience.\\r\\n\\r\\n97.

Eyelet Embroidery, Suggestions for.--For some time after I began doing\\r\\n\"eyelet work\" I wondered if there was not some way to fasten the thread\\r\\nafter completing an eyelet. A friend of mine showed me a solution of my\\r\\nproblem. It was to leave the last three loops loose enough so that I could\\r\\npass the thread back through them after completing the eyelet. Then I\\r\\ncarefully pulled each of these loops down and cut off the thread. This\\r\\nobviates the necessity of any knots that are so unsightly, and at the same\\r\\ntime, the thread is firmly secured. 99. To Prevent Stockings from Wearing\\r\\nOut.--Paste pieces of velvet soft side up, into the heels of your shoes,\\r\\nbottom and back, and you will find your stockings darning reduced by a big\\r\\nper cent.\\r\\n\\r\\n100. Needle Sharpener.--I know a woman who always keeps a small piece of\\r\\nwhetstone in her machine drawer for sharpening needles when they become\\r\\nblunted. It is a great scheme, and saves a lot of needles, as I have\\r\\nproved to my own satisfaction.\\r\\n\\r\\n101. Burned Kettles.--If you have had the misfortune to burn your kettle\\r\\nit may be made smooth and clean by filling it with ashes and water,\\r\\nleaving it for an hour or so, then washing with clear water.\\r\\n\\r\\n102. Children\\'s Petticoats.--When making washable petticoats for her small\\r\\ndaughters, a mother whom I know attaches two skirts to one belt, which in\\r\\nturn is sewed to a little lace trimmed waist. The lower skirt is made of\\r\\nwhite cambric, and the top skirt is of swiss embroidery. This arrangement\\r\\nsaves time in dressing the little ones and their upper and lower\\r\\npetticoats are always of the same length and set evenly.\\r\\n\\r\\n[868 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\n103. Systematic Housekeeping.--A friend of mine who has a six-room\\r\\napartment delights in taking care of it in sections, one room a day. On\\r\\neach of the six days in the week one room is thoroughly cleaned and put in\\r\\norder. She plans, if possible, to add some little touch of adornment, a\\r\\nnew rocker, or vase, or table cover, or pincushion. In this way there is\\r\\nalways something new to notice and admire, and yet no new and startling\\r\\nchanges and never any accumulation of hard work.\\r\\n\\r\\n104.

How to Freshen Nuts.--We had a lot of nuts that became too dry to be\\r\\ngood, and were about to throw them away, when a friend told us of a very\\r\\neasy and practical way to freshen them. It was this: to let them stand\\r\\nover night in a solution of equal parts of milk and water, then dry them\\r\\nslowly in a moderate oven. They tasted so fresh and proved to be such an\\r\\neconomy, that we thought the idea well worth passing along.\\r\\n\\r\\n106. Measure the Eggs.--Try measuring the whites of eggs for angel food\\r\\ninstead of counting them, for best results.\\r\\n\\r\\n107.

It is a very simple\\r\\nmethod of securing a splendid light.\\r\\n\\r\\n108. Baking Help.--When creaming butter and sugar for cake or cookies, add\\r\\ntwo tablespoonfuls of boiling water, then deduct this amount from the\\r\\nother liquid used. Beat hard with a spoon, and the mixture will become a\\r\\nlight creamy mass in one-third of the time it otherwise would take.\\r\\n\\r\\n109. To Destroy Disagreeable Odors.--The cooking of onions, cabbage, or\\r\\nfrying articles always leaves a disagreeable odor in our house. To get rid\\r\\nof this I place an old tin over a lighted burner and sprinkle some ground\\r\\ncinnamon on it. When the tin is very hot I carry it through the house on\\r\\nthe dustpan, leaving behind me the pleasant pungent odor of the spice.\\r\\n\\r\\n110. The Last Step.--A great many times last winter I had to go into the\\r\\ncellar to tend to the furnace when it was too light to light a lamp, and\\r\\ntoo dark to enable one to see easily. Almost every time I had to feel\\r\\naround to be sure that I was on the bottom step. One day my husband was\\r\\ndoing some painting in the cellar and happened to think that a little\\r\\nwhite paint on that step would help. Now we wonder why we did not think of\\r\\nit before.\\r\\n\\r\\n[MISCELLANEOUS RECIPES 869]\\r\\n\\r\\n111. Truth spoken with malicious intent is greater error than keeping of\\r\\nsilence where wrong is meant.\\r\\n\\r\\n112.

Sour Milk Pancakes.--We are very fond of sour milk pancakes, and have\\r\\noften had to go without any in the winter when the weather was cold, just\\r\\nbecause the milk would not sour. I have learned to put a teaspoonful of\\r\\nvinegar in a pan of milk, that I wanted to use for the cakes the next\\r\\nmorning, and find that it never fails me in making the milk sour. Placing\\r\\nthe pan over the register for the night helps matters along.\\r\\n\\r\\n119.

This\\r\\nwill make it last for a longer period.\\r\\n\\r\\n120. Rust Spots on Clothes.--Many rust spots on clothes are caused by bits\\r\\nof soap adhering to the latter when they come in contact with the bluing\\r\\nwater. The discovery has been of great help to me because I can now easily\\r\\navoid having these unsightly marks. I merely cut the soap into small\\r\\npieces, and tie them in a salt bag I keep for the purpose. With this\\r\\ntreatment the soap dissolves just as quickly but does not come into direct\\r\\ncontact with the clothes.\\r\\n\\r\\n[870 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\n121.

They should be kept\\r\\nscrupulously clean, and in order that they may be so they should be washed\\r\\nout carefully with soap, and well rinsed each time they have been used.\\r\\nAfter this has been done they may be hung in the air to dry.

Apples Cored for Baking.--Apples cored for baking are delicious\\r\\nfilled with orange marmalade and a little butter and sugar.\\r\\n\\r\\n175. Beating Eggs.--When heating eggs observe that there is no grease on\\r\\nthe beater, as it will prevent the eggs from frothing.\\r\\n\\r\\n176. If you judge as evil the actions of another, through the judging\\r\\ncomes evil to you.\\r\\n\\r\\n177. A Toy Saw.--A toy saw may be utilized many times in the kitchen for\\r\\nsawing meat bones which are too large.\\r\\n\\r\\n178. If a White Dress Has Turned Yellow.--If last summer\\'s white dress has\\r\\nturned yellow, put it in a stone jar, cover with buttermilk and let it\\r\\nstand a day and night. Then wash well and starch with blued starch. This\\r\\nis better to whiten goods than freezing, sunshine, or the use of borax.\\r\\n\\r\\n[MISCELLANEOUS RECIPES 875]\\r\\n\\r\\n179. Scorched Food.--A practical cook says: When food has been scorched\\r\\nremove the pan from the fire and set into a pan of cold water. Lay a dish\\r\\ntowel over the pan. The towel will absorb all the scorch taste sent up by\\r\\nthe steam and the family need never know it was burned.\\r\\n\\r\\n180. Mutton Chops to Make Tender.--Mutton chops can be made tender quite\\r\\nas much as lamb, if before they are boiled or fried they are allowed to\\r\\nsimmer in just a little water on the back of the stove. This also makes\\r\\nthe flavor more delicate.\\r\\n\\r\\n181. Hollowing Out a Tomato.--For hollowing out a tomato, previous to\\r\\nstuffing, a pair of scissors enables a person to remove all the pulp\\r\\nwithout breaking the skin. They are equally useful for fruit salads as the\\r\\nfine skin which separates the sections of the grape fruit and oranges is\\r\\neasily clipped off.\\r\\n\\r\\n182. The Easiest Way to Blacken a Stove.--The easiest way to blacken a\\r\\nstove is to use a flat paint brush about one and a half inches wide, and a\\r\\ntin or jar, large enough to receive the brush, to mix the blacking in.\\r\\nApply the blacking to the stove as you would paint, and use a newspaper to\\r\\npolish with, which can be burned. In this way the hands do not come in\\r\\ncontact with the blacking during the whole operation, and unsightly cloths\\r\\nand brushes, which soil the hands, are done away with.\\r\\n\\r\\n183. Making Gravies.--For making gravies, thickening of roast gravies, it\\r\\nwill be found useful to have browned flour on hand at all times, which can\\r\\nreadily be kept in a mason jar or any covered vessel.\\r\\n\\r\\n184. Kitchen Mittens.--Kitchen mittens can be bought in several\\r\\nthicknesses and sizes for various branches of housework. There are thick\\r\\nones, with straps across the wrist to wear when polishing the ranges, then\\r\\nthere are others to put on when scrubbing the sink or floors, and still\\r\\nthinner ones with chamois cloth inside to use for polishing silverware.\\r\\nThese mittens are a great protection to the hands and finger-nails, and\\r\\nthey really simplify the work to a great extent.\\r\\n\\r\\n185. To Improve Baked Potatoes.--To improve baked potatoes let them stand\\r\\nin a pan of cold water for about an hour, then put them in the oven while\\r\\nwet. This seems to steam them and cook them much quicker.\\r\\n\\r\\n186. Meat Shortcake.--Give your household a meat shortcake sometimes. Make\\r\\nthe shortcake as you would for a fruit filling, a rather short biscuit\\r\\ndough, and put between the layers creamed chicken or creamed veal, and\\r\\nhave it served with plenty of gravy.\\r\\n\\r\\n187. Put a handful of coarse oatmeal in the water bottle and half fill\\r\\nwith water. Let stand half an hour, then shake well and rinse. The bottle\\r\\nwill look like new.\\r\\n\\r\\n188. Making a Kitchen Apron.--In making a kitchen apron, provide it with\\r\\nan immense pocket in which can be carried a large dustcloth. Often one\\r\\nnotices dusty places, on the furniture, windows or banisters while doing\\r\\nthe morning work, and the dust-cloth is at hand. Again one has to pick up\\r\\nnumerous little articles to throw into the waste basket and the pocket\\r\\nholds such articles until the waste basket is reached. It is equally handy\\r\\nfor holding a few clothes pins, while hanging out the clothes; in fact the\\r\\nlarge pocket is recognized as something decidedly useful in the kitchen\\r\\napron.\\r\\n\\r\\n[876 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\n189. To Make a Neat Buttonhole.--To make a neat buttonhole in thin white\\r\\nmaterial that is likely to ravel when cut, take a piece of white soap and\\r\\napply it to the back of the goods using enough to make a generous coat.\\r\\nCut the buttonhole and work; you will find that the work is easily done\\r\\nand the buttonhole will not ravel.\\r\\n\\r\\n190. To Mark Scallops.--To mark scallops place your thimble or spool just\\r\\noutside the circle line and mark around it with a pencil. In this way, any\\r\\nsized scallop can be made.\\r\\n\\r\\n191. Delicate Fabrics to Clean.--Delicate fabrics can be cleaned perfectly\\r\\nby using gasoline with a teacupful of corn meal. The meal scours out all\\r\\nthe spots. Place the meal in a dish, pour gasoline over it, then press and\\r\\nrub through the hands. Apply to soiled spots, rubbing carefully. Brush out\\r\\nwith stiff brush.\\r\\n\\r\\n192. When Using a Lap-Board.--While sewing a garment with the material\\r\\nlying on the lap-board, use glass top push pins to hold the goods on the\\r\\nboard. One pin will oftentimes be sufficient. The pin is very sharp, and\\r\\nis easily thrust through the material into the board, and leaves a hole\\r\\nabout the size of that made with a needle.\\r\\n\\r\\n193. To Shape Cookies.--Cookies can be shaped with the bottom of a \"star\"\\r\\ntumbler. Flour the bottom of the glass and press it into the unbaked\\r\\ncookie until the indentions are imprinted upon the cake.\\r\\n\\r\\n194. Have You Been Hoarding an Old Foulard Dress--One of that kind of\\r\\ndresses which you liked and hated to part with, but it went out of style.\\r\\nGet it out, clean it, rip it, and if there is not enough in it to make a\\r\\nscant shirt-waisted one-piece empire dress, make it into a pretty\\r\\nshirt-waist, with knife plaiting down the front.\\r\\n\\r\\n195. To Wash Tarnished Brass.--Save the water in which the potatoes have\\r\\nbeen boiled, and use it to wash tarnished brass. It will come out as\\r\\nbright as new.\\r\\n\\r\\n196. Sewing Lace.--When sewing two raw edges of fine lace together, like\\r\\nthe tiny lace ruffles on lingerie blouses or dresses, do not fell it in\\r\\nthe old-fashioned way, but place the two right sides together and bind the\\r\\nedge with the finest thread, making a buttonhole stitch along the edges.\\r\\nPut a stitch in each mesh, and you will have a neat lace seam which, when\\r\\npressed, can scarcely be observed, and it will not fray.\\r\\n\\r\\n197. Roasted Chestnuts.--Roasted chestnuts are said to be very delicious\\r\\nwhen salted the same as peanuts.\\r\\n\\r\\n198. Mud Stains, to Remove.--Mud stains will disappear from cloth by the\\r\\nfollowing method of cleansing: After brushing the dry mud away sponge the\\r\\nremaining stain with a weak solution of ammonia and water. This is\\r\\nabsolutely safe to apply to black cloth. Colored goods, however, should be\\r\\nsponged with a solution of bicarbonate of soda as the latter does not\\r\\naffect coloring matter.\\r\\n\\r\\n[MISCELLANEOUS RECIPES 877]\\r\\n\\r\\n199. Drop Table for Kitchen.--A woman can have a kitchen made in a very\\r\\ncramped quarter if she provides it with a small work table, and a drop\\r\\nleaf table attached to the wall. If the stationary table is covered on all\\r\\nsides with a curtain and furnished with an undershelf, it will hold as\\r\\nmuch as a cupboard. Two large shelves will be found very convenient, even\\r\\nthough it will be necessary to mount a chair or stool to reach the kitchen\\r\\narticles. Usually extremely small kitchens are more convenient than large\\r\\nones, in which many steps must be taken.\\r\\n\\r\\n200. A Convenience for Ironing Day.--The laundress who knows how to take\\r\\ncare of herself has a high stool with rungs for her feet, on which she may\\r\\nsit when she is ironing the light pieces. It will help reserve her\\r\\nstrength for the next day\\'s work.\\r\\n\\r\\n201. Quickest Way to Core Apples.--One of the simplest and quickest ways\\r\\nto core apples for baking is to use an ordinary clothes pin.\\r\\n\\r\\n202. To Remove Iron Rust.--Tartaric acid will remove almost any iron rust\\r\\nblemish from material and is excellent for removing yellow marks.\\r\\n\\r\\n203. The Kitchen Apron.--The kitchen apron should cover the skirt and the\\r\\nfront of the waist, though not necessarily the sleeves, as most house\\r\\ndresses are made with short sleeves.\\r\\n\\r\\n204. Cookies, to Keep.--Cookies put in an earthen jar lined with clean\\r\\ncloth, while they are still hot, and kept covered closely, will be much\\r\\nmore melting and crumbling than if they were allowed to cool in the air.\\r\\n\\r\\n205. Discolored China Baking Dishes.--Discolored china baking dishes can\\r\\nbe made as clean as when new by rubbing them with whiting.\\r\\n\\r\\n206. Care of Drippings.--The care of drippings in the kitchen, with the\\r\\nprice of food so high, should receive more attention. In cooking all\\r\\nmeats, poultry, and in making soup the grease should be carefully skimmed\\r\\noff and saved. Render it out once a week and after a good boiling, strain\\r\\nthrough cheesecloth. When cool skim the fat off and use in place of\\r\\nlard,--except for pie and biscuit.\\r\\n\\r\\n207. To Mend Rubber.--To mend rubber, use soft kid from an old glove and\\r\\npaste to the patch the gum of automobile paste. The leather adheres better\\r\\nto the gum than a gum patch.\\r\\n\\r\\n208. Cleaning Black Woolen Clothing.--The following is a good recipe for\\r\\ncleaning black woolen clothing: Dissolve borax in water and saturate a\\r\\nsponge or cloth in the solution. Wash the greasy spots by rubbing\\r\\nvigorously, then rinse in clear water the same way and dry in the sun.\\r\\nThis is especially good for cleaning men\\'s coat collars.\\r\\n\\r\\n[878 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\n209. To Prevent Tinware Rusting.--To prevent tinware from rusting rub over\\r\\nwith fresh lard and put in a hot oven for a few minutes before using it.\\r\\nIf treated in this way it will never rust.\\r\\n\\r\\n210. To Remove Machine Grease.--Cold water and a teaspoonful of ammonia\\r\\nand soap will remove machine grease when other means would not answer on\\r\\naccount of the colors running.\\r\\n\\r\\n211. To Keep Cheese From Drying.--Wring a cloth from vinegar and wrap\\r\\nseveral thicknesses around the cheese to keep it from moulding and drying.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n212. Small Hand Churn.--A small hand churn makes home-made butter and\\r\\ncheese possible. It is no trouble whatever to make a pot of yellow butter,\\r\\nfresh and sweet, by the aid of one of these convenient little churns.\\r\\nAfter it is made it may be rolled into a delicate little pat and kept in\\r\\nan earthen jar made purposely for butter.\\r\\n\\r\\n213. Larding a Piece of Meat.--Larding a piece of meat is a simple\\r\\noperation, and it is one which will greatly add to the juiciness of the\\r\\ndish. Cut a piece of salt pork into strips quarter of an inch thick and\\r\\ntwo or three inches long. Slip these into a larding needle and draw the\\r\\nneedle through the meat, so either end of the pork will protrude beyond\\r\\nthe meat.\\r\\n\\r\\n214. To Make Vegetables Tender.--Cutting onions, turnips, and carrots\\r\\nacross the fiber makes them more tender when cooked.\\r\\n\\r\\n215. Clear black coffee diluted with water containing a little ammonia,\\r\\nwill clean and restore black clothes.\\r\\n\\r\\n216. To Make Linen Easier to Write on.--To make linen easier to write on\\r\\nwhen marking, dip the pieces you wish to mark into cold starch, rub over\\r\\nwith hot iron and you will be able to write without the pen scratching.\\r\\n\\r\\n217. To Air Pillows.--To air pillows, rip the corner of the ticking an\\r\\ninch or more. Insert a piece of rubber hose pipe a few inches long, first\\r\\ncovering the exposed end of the tube with strong netting. Sew the ticking\\r\\nfirmly to it and then hang all day on the line, in the air punching and\\r\\nshaking many times during the day. They will be light and fluffy besides\\r\\nbeing thoroughly aired and sweet and clean.\\r\\n\\r\\n218. Uses for Pea-Pods.--Never throw away pea-pods; they give a delicious\\r\\nflavor to the puree for the next day.\\r\\n\\r\\n219. To Remove the Skins of Tomatoes Quickly.--To remove the skins of\\r\\ntomatoes quickly, put them into a wire basket and sink it quickly into a\\r\\nkettle of hot  water. Do not let the tomatoes stand in the water long\\r\\nenough to heat through, and plunge into cold water immediately from the\\r\\nhot. Another way is to rub the skins backward with the blunt edge of a\\r\\nknife. In this way the tomato does not need scalding, and according to\\r\\nepicures is more tasty.\\r\\n\\r\\n220. Dyeing at Home.--In dyeing at home amateurs often make the mistake of\\r\\nputting the dyed article through the wringer, possibly to avoid staining\\r\\nthe hands for one reason, or perhaps hoping to dry the garment more\\r\\nquickly. This however, should never be done, for the creases so formed are\\r\\nmost obstinate and in fact, often only disappear with wear, despite all\\r\\npressing. Dyed articles should be squeezed and hung out of doors to dry.\\r\\n\\r\\n[MISCELLANEOUS RECIPES 879]\\r\\n\\r\\n221.--To Save Children\\'s Shoes.--To save children\\'s shoes wash them\\r\\noccasionally to remove the dirt and old polish, and soften them with oil.\\r\\nWhen any part of the sole becomes badly worn, it should be mended at once,\\r\\nfor usually a shoe will wear out at one point more quickly than elsewhere,\\r\\nand by paying ten or fifteen cents to have that part mended it saves\\r\\ndollars in time. Gunmetal shoes are preferable for everyday wear, for such\\r\\nshoes are lusterless and can be cleaned with oils instead of polish, which\\r\\nis destructive to the best leather, even when sparingly used.\\r\\n\\r\\n222. A Systematic Housewife.--It is a handy plan for the business woman or\\r\\nthe housewife who has much domestic accounting to do to keep two\\r\\ncalendars, one to tear off day by day, the other to refer back to past\\r\\ndates when necessary. The reference calendar which can be very small and\\r\\ninconspicuous should have its special hook on the desk or table.\\r\\n\\r\\n223. To Keep Candles in Warm Weather.--Keep your candles in the ice box\\r\\nthis warm weather. They will remain beautifully upright through a whole\\r\\nevening\\'s use, if they are hardened first in this way.\\r\\n\\r\\n224. Tea Towels.--Keep the tea towels in sight, then have them fresh,\\r\\nclean, and whole, and hang them on a long metal curtain pole, in a\\r\\nconvenient place, say back of the sink. This is better than placing the\\r\\ntowels on a nail against the wall as is usually done, and it permits them\\r\\nto dry out quickly.\\r\\n\\r\\n225. A Spotless House.--A house that is spotless at the price of the\\r\\nfamily\\'s peace or of the housekeeper\\'s best self, is the worst sort of an\\r\\ninvestment. You, the woman, are of vastly more importance than your\\r\\nsurroundings. If you feel yourself becoming a mere drudge, if your family\\r\\nis growing away from you mentally, if your nerves are weakening under a\\r\\nfetish of cleanliness, get time to read.\\r\\n\\r\\n226. To Keep Flooring in Place.--Strips of moulding may be tacked around\\r\\nthe edges of a room at the baseboard, so as to cover the edge of oilcloth\\r\\nor linoleum. This holds the floor covering in place and prevents dust from\\r\\ngetting beneath it.\\r\\n\\r\\n227. Light Colored Wall Paper.--Light colored wall paper may be cleaned by\\r\\na careful rubbing with a very clean rubber of the kind which artists use.\\r\\nIf the spot cleaned seems lighter than the surrounding color it may be\\r\\ntoned down by a gentle rubbing with a clean chamois skin.\\r\\n\\r\\n228. To Keep Canary Seed Away from Mice.--If there are any mice in the\\r\\nhouse, the best way to keep the canary from being robbed of its food is to\\r\\nempty the contents of a cardboard box of bird seed into a quart preserve\\r\\njar and cover with a screw top.\\r\\n\\r\\n[880 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\n229. Convenient Scrub Bucket.--The most convenient scrub bucket is light,\\r\\nand is made of galvanized iron with a wide flaring top. The bucket is to\\r\\nbe fitted with a wire soap tray on the outside, for often the soap is\\r\\nwasted while floating in the water if there is no convenient place to put\\r\\nit, while scrubbing. Holes can be punctured in the bucket and the wire\\r\\ntray fastened on with a heavy cord or a pliable wire,\\r\\n\\r\\n230. Fruit Stains on Table Linen.--Fruit stains on table linen should be\\r\\ntaken out before the cloth is put in the wash tub. Soap and water will set\\r\\nthe stains.\\r\\n\\r\\n231. Wicker Furniture.--Do not scrub your unpainted wicker furniture with\\r\\nsoap and water, as it will turn it yellow and ruin its looks. Instead, try\\r\\nscrubbing it with a strong solution of salt water. If you have pieces that\\r\\nare so shabby that they must either be painted or thrown away, try the\\r\\nsalt water treatment first. Scrub well and put in the sun and air and dry\\r\\nquickly.\\r\\n\\r\\n232. Removing Dirt from Carpet.--Of all the ways to remove dirt from a\\r\\ncarpet, the worst is by the use of the ordinary short brush which involves\\r\\nthe housemaid\\'s kneeling down in the dust.\\r\\n\\r\\n233. How to Preserve the Household Broom.--The ordinary household broom\\r\\nwill last twice as long, if care is taken of it, as it will if it is just\\r\\nused anyhow. When it is new, before using it, put it in a pail of hot\\r\\nwater and let it remain there until the water is quite cold. Then\\r\\nthoroughly dry--in the sun if possible. Always clean it after sweeping, by\\r\\ndipping in water and shaking well before putting it away and occasionally\\r\\ngive it a thorough washing in hot soda water.\\r\\n\\r\\n234. A Good Furniture Polish.--A good furniture polish may be made of\\r\\nparaffin oil and turpentine. Kerosene too is very good, while crude oil\\r\\nmay be used to darken wood that has not been varnished.\\r\\n\\r\\n235. Delicious Salad.--Seeded raisins cut in pieces, broken nut meats, and\\r\\na small part of celery in thin bits make up a delicious salad.\\r\\n\\r\\n236. To Clean Light Rugs.--Rugs with white or very light ground may be\\r\\ncleaned by sprinkling with cornstarch, mixed with one-sixth its bulk of\\r\\nprepared chalk. Let the starch remain several hours and brush it out with\\r\\na fine whiskbroom, then hang in the sun and heat well before putting down.\\r\\nThis method is recommended for fine, silky rugs, as it injures neither\\r\\ntint nor texture and makes a beautifully clean surface.\\r\\n\\r\\n237. To Light a Closet of Any Kind.--To light a closet of any kind, but\\r\\nespecially a linen closet, the safest thing--next to electricity is a\\r\\nlight clear glass lantern with wire guards outside the glass. Swing it by\\r\\na light chain pulley, some little way in front of the shelves. Thus a\\r\\ntouch sends it up or down, throwing the light wherever it may be needed.\\r\\n\\r\\n[MISCELLANEOUS RECIPES 881]\\r\\n\\r\\n238. To Remove White Marks on Furniture.--A mixture composed of equal\\r\\nparts of turpentine and linseed oil will remove the white marks on\\r\\nfurniture caused by water. Rub it on with a soft rag and wipe off with a\\r\\nperfectly clean duster.\\r\\n\\r\\n239. If Your Paint Has Been Marred.--If your paint has been marred by\\r\\ncareless scratching of matches, try rubbing it with the finest sand paper.\\r\\nUse a half lemon for removing match marks from paint.\\r\\n\\r\\n240. To Remove Inkstains from Cotton.--To remove ink-stains from cotton\\r\\nmaterial, place the stain over the steam and apply salt and lemon juice\\r\\nwhich will soon remove the ink.\\r\\n\\r\\n241. To Clean Plaster-of-Paris.--To clean plaster-of-paris figures, cover\\r\\nwith a thick coating of starch and water, let it dry on the surface and\\r\\nthe dirt will brush off with the dry powder.\\r\\n\\r\\n242. To Clean Piano Keys.--A cloth moistened with alcohol will clean piano\\r\\nkeys.\\r\\n\\r\\n243. Washing Veils.--When veils are washed at home they usually come out\\r\\nquite limber and flimsy. To give them the stiffness add a pinch of sugar\\r\\nto the rinse water.\\r\\n\\r\\n244. To Take Candle Grease Out of Linen.--To take candle grease out of\\r\\nlinen, place the linen between two sheets of thick white blotting paper,\\r\\nand set a hot iron on it, leaving it there long enough for the iron to\\r\\nbecome perceptibly cooler. If necessary repeat this until the grease is\\r\\nremoved.\\r\\n\\r\\n245. Cleaning the Sweeping Brush.--Try cleaning the sweeping brush with an\\r\\nold comb. It is a good plan, for it preserves the brush and keeps it\\r\\nclean, and at the same time saves your hands.\\r\\n\\r\\n246. Bright Wood Berries May be Preserved.--Almost any kind of bright wood\\r\\nberries may be preserved for decorative use in the winter, by dipping in\\r\\nmelted paraffin and putting away in a cool place until needed. Treated in\\r\\nthis way berries will remain firm and bright for a long time, and may be\\r\\nused in many ways.\\r\\n\\r\\n247. Old Wood Work to Keep Clean.--Old woodwork, that is so hard to keep\\r\\nclean, can be made to look like new grained wood, by first painting it\\r\\nwith cream colored paint to give a body alike, and when dry go over it\\r\\nwith a dark oak varnish stain; with a little practice it can be made to\\r\\nlook like grained wood. The varnish dries quickly and leaves it darker in\\r\\nsome places. Any old furniture can be treated in the same way.\\r\\n\\r\\n248. To Prevent Chairs Marring the Floor.--One should have all rockers\\r\\ncovered with half rounds of rubber to prevent the scratching of the porch\\r\\nfloor. These rocker tires are procurable at any furniture establishment\\r\\nand are easily adjusted.\\r\\n\\r\\n249. Summer Homes.--Some of the wealthiest women are furnishing their\\r\\nsummer homes with rag rugs, instead of the handsome oriental floor\\r\\ncoverings, that are a mark of luxury; and what seems odd to those who\\r\\ncannot afford to please each whim, the rooms are being repapered with\\r\\nsimple sprigged effects and all evidences of up-to-dateness are being\\r\\neliminated, to be in keeping with these copies of the colonial rag\\r\\ncarpets.\\r\\n\\r\\n[882  MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\n250. To Destroy Flies.--Flies will get into the house during the summer in\\r\\nspite of the greatest care. One method of catching and killing them,\\r\\nwithout having disagreeable looking fly paper lying around is to prepare a\\r\\nmixture of cream, sugar and pepper. Put this on a plate and they will eat\\r\\ngreedily of it and die. They will instantly seek the open air and it is\\r\\neasy to brush them from the screen doors. This is an old method and a good\\r\\none.\\r\\n\\r\\n251. Successful Fern Growing.--A woman who has had her refrigerator placed\\r\\non the porch has a long drain pipe to carry off the melted ice, and this\\r\\nis made to flow right into a large bed of ferns. The cold water in no way\\r\\ndestroys the plants, in fact, they can endure the coldest water, and last\\r\\nyear her ferns grew to an enormous size all due to the daily supply of\\r\\nwater from the refrigerator.\\r\\n\\r\\n252. Faded Crepe.--Faded crepe can be dipped into a solution of water and\\r\\nindigo, the water made very dark with blueing for the purpose. Dissolve in\\r\\none quart of water, a teaspoonful of sugar. Lift the crepe out, and shake\\r\\nit and pin it to the bed to dry. As it can not be ironed pin it carefully\\r\\nover soft muslin with needles.\\r\\n\\r\\n253. Sweeping as a Beautifier.--The average woman who does her own\\r\\nhousework gets exercise enough, only it is not under the best conditions,\\r\\nfor the air, as a rule, is not sufficiently fresh. If she wants to be\\r\\nbenefited physically, while putting her house in order, let her make it\\r\\nlike outdoors, with the windows wide open so the fresh air can sweep\\r\\nthrough the rooms. If necessary she can wear a jacket while making beds\\r\\nand sweeping, and by the time her work is done she is bound to be in a\\r\\nhealthy glow. If she does not do housework she must go outdoors, and walk,\\r\\nand indeed, a little walking is desirable even for the housekeeper.\\r\\n\\r\\n254. Putting Screens Away.--If screens were carefully put away last fall\\r\\nthere should be little difficulty in getting them in place on the first\\r\\nhot fly-breeding day. The wise housekeeper writes on the top of her\\r\\nscreen, where it is hidden from view by the upper sash, the room and\\r\\nwindow where it belongs. She also covers the wires with a coating of\\r\\nvaselin and stores them in a dry place with a cover thrown over them.\\r\\nShould the wire have become shabby and rusty looking it can be freshened\\r\\nup with a coat of paint. If the wires have gone into holes and are badly\\r\\nbulged, replace with copper wire netting. It costs more than the ordinary\\r\\nkind, but does not wear out nearly so soon.\\r\\n\\r\\n255. Attractive Living Room.--The living room is sure to have a cheery\\r\\natmosphere if provided with a wooden seat at either side. The wooden shelf\\r\\nis a good place for the clock, candlesticks, and a few simple flower\\r\\nvases.\\r\\n\\r\\n[MISCELLANEOUS RECIPES 883]\\r\\n\\r\\n256. Finger Bowl.--A finger bowel should always have a few flowers or a\\r\\nleaf floating around on the surface.\\r\\n\\r\\n257. Raw Oysters.--Raw oysters are further improved by sections of lemon\\r\\nor sprigs of mint among the cracked ice.\\r\\n\\r\\n258. Cheerfulness at Meals.--Meals should be something more than the\\r\\nconsumption of food. All work stops at those times and people meet\\r\\ntogether. Nothing that can be done should be omitted to make it an\\r\\noccasion of agreeable interchange of thought and conversation, and when\\r\\nthis is done, not only the body, but the mind and nerves are refreshed.\\r\\n\\r\\n259. To Keep a Rug from Curling.--The edge of the heavy rug will not curl\\r\\nif treated to a coat of shellac on the under side.\\r\\n\\r\\n260. Grease Stains on Silk.--For grease stains on silk, rub the silk with\\r\\nFrench chalk or magnesia, and then hold it to the fire. Thus the grease\\r\\nwill be absorbed by the powder, which may then be brushed off.\\r\\n\\r\\n261. Ironing Centerpieces.--When ironing centerpieces of tablecloths, see\\r\\nthat the iron moves with the straight grain of the cloth. If this method\\r\\nis followed the circular edge will take its true line.\\r\\n\\r\\n262. Tucking Children\\'s Dresses.--When hand tucks are to be used on\\r\\nchildren\\'s dresses, they should be very carefully made, and the first one\\r\\nkept perfectly straight to use as a guide for the others. A good way to do\\r\\nthis is to loosen one thread, not to pull out but sufficiently draw it to\\r\\nshow the straight line, and crease the tuck in this line. After the width\\r\\nof the tuck and space between each is decided use a notched card as a\\r\\nmeasure for all the other tucks.\\r\\n\\r\\n263. A Neat Way to Mend Table Linen.--A neat way to mend table linen is to\\r\\ndarn it with linen threads off an older tablecloth. It will look much\\r\\nneater than a patch sewed on. It is advisable to keep a piece of a\\r\\ndiscarded tablecloth in the mending basket for that purpose.\\r\\n\\r\\n264. A Good Substitute for a Toaster.--If the toaster is suddenly lost,\\r\\nyou can find a very good substitute in the popcorn popper. It can be held\\r\\nover the gas or before the coal fire, and the bread will toast in a few\\r\\nminutes.\\r\\n\\r\\n265. To Prepare Cauliflower.--To prepare cauliflower remove all the large\\r\\ngreen leaves and greater part of stalk. Soak in cold water, to which has\\r\\nbeen added one teaspoonful of vinegar and a half teaspoonful of salt to\\r\\neach quart.\\r\\n\\r\\n266. Preserving Dress Patterns.--Some women, after they have used a\\r\\npattern, just roll it up and tuck it away wherever it happens, and when\\r\\nthey want to use it the next time, it curls up and acts so that there is\\r\\nno doing anything with it. If they would just lay the patterns out flat\\r\\nand put them where they might stay that way, all this trouble would be\\r\\navoided.\\r\\n\\r\\n[884 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\n267. Lace on Centerpieces.--Lace that is used on centerpieces is not\\r\\nfulled, but is just held in enough to lie flat. The best way to get this\\r\\nflatness is to draw the thread of the lace and fasten one end to the\\r\\nlinen, leaving enough to make a neat seam, and then to adjust fullness so\\r\\nthat it lies evenly. When right side is up one cannot see that any\\r\\nfullness exists.\\r\\n\\r\\n268. Uses of Mop Handles.--Most women have found the mop handle with the\\r\\nhandy clasp, a general utility tool. There is a great deal of unnecessary\\r\\nbending of the knees to the household gods. It is a painful attitude, and\\r\\nwork that can be done just as well in a standing position, should never be\\r\\ndone in a kneeling one.\\r\\n\\r\\n269. Iron Holders Made from Asbestos.--Iron holders made from a piece of\\r\\nasbestos the desired size, and covered with drilling or heavy unbleached\\r\\nmuslin are light and keep out the heat. There should be a ring or loop\\r\\nsewed to one corner to hang up the holder.\\r\\n\\r\\n270. Washing Quilts.--To wash quilts a housekeeper gives the following\\r\\ndirections: Dissolve a bar of white soap in a cupful of water. Run into\\r\\nyour bath-tub sufficient water to cover one quilt; make a good suds, and\\r\\nput in the quilt, and let it soak for a few minutes. Do not rub, but use\\r\\nthe washboard, top end down, to press or pound out the water and dirt.\\r\\nNever wring but with the wash-board press out the water. Rinse several\\r\\ntimes. When you have pressed out as dry as you can pin the quilt closely\\r\\non the line to drain. When thoroughly dry, whip with a carpet beater until\\r\\nfluffy, before removing from the line. This method is especially fine for\\r\\ntied quilts. The bath tub is preferred, because of shape and water\\r\\nconveniences.\\r\\n\\r\\n271. Shrinking Dress Goods.--Before making the white linen dress skirt, or\\r\\nany material that is liable to shrink, fold the goods carefully and place\\r\\nit in a tub and cover with water. Let it get thoroughly wet, stretch the\\r\\nclothes line as tightly as possible, hang the goods through the center,\\r\\nand pin perfectly straight on the line. When dry, let two persons stretch\\r\\nthe goods as curtains are stretched, fold it with the wrong side of the\\r\\nmaterial out and iron double with the seam running through the center of\\r\\nthe goods on the length of the material. In shrinking colored prints add\\r\\nturpentine to the water, and it will set the color. A teaspoonful is used\\r\\nto a gallon of water.\\r\\n\\r\\n272. Fixing Worn Corsets.--For stitching over worn corset stays, a wide\\r\\nwhite tape is unequaled.\\r\\n\\r\\n273. Cooking Breakfast Food.--Don\\'t leave the tin lid on the saucepan if\\r\\nyou start the cereal in the evening for breakfast. It will rust and the\\r\\nmoisture drip into the food.\\r\\n\\r\\n274. Tough Meat to Make Tender.--Tough meat can be made tender by adding a\\r\\nteacupful of lemon juice to the water in which it is boiled.\\r\\n\\r\\n275. To Preserve Pineapple.--To preserve pineapple allow only\\r\\nthree-quarters of a pound of sugar to each pound of pineapple.\\r\\n\\r\\n[MISCELLANEOUS RECIPES 885]\\r\\n\\r\\n276. Hemstitching Underclothing.--Hemstitching forms a dainty finish for\\r\\nthe household linen and underclothing, but the busy woman often will not\\r\\nundertake it because of the difficulty of drawing the threads. If a piece\\r\\nof white soap be rubbed on the underside of the cloth, where the\\r\\nhemstitching is to be done, the threads may be drawn with ease, in half\\r\\nthe time that is usually required.\\r\\n\\r\\n277. To Boil Eggs Without Cracking Them.--To boil eggs without the risk of\\r\\ncracking, hold them in a spoonful of boiling water before immersing them.\\r\\n\\r\\n278. Save the Basting Thread.--Basting threads, when saved, should be\\r\\nwound on a spool, otherwise they get hopelessly tangled and are not used\\r\\nagain.\\r\\n\\r\\n279. Threading Needles.--Thread will knot less easily, if the end that is\\r\\nbroken from the spool is run through the eye of the needle.\\r\\n\\r\\n280. Measuring Dress Goods.--Do not measure dress goods and laces with a\\r\\ntape line, as it stretches the material. Use a yardstick.\\r\\n\\r\\n281. Do Not Use Coarse Thread.--An expert needlewoman says that the reason\\r\\nwhy so much embroidery does not look attractive is that too coarse a\\r\\nthread is used for the work. It is not a bad rule to use a cotton a number\\r\\nor two finer than is recommended, unless the advice comes from one who\\r\\nunderstands embroidery perfectly.\\r\\n\\r\\n282. Putting in a Temporary Hem.--The hem of a dress that must be\\r\\nlengthened after it is laundered should be turned perfectly straight and\\r\\nstitched with number one hundred thread. It can be easily ripped and the\\r\\nfine threads will not leave the usual stitched lines that one often sees\\r\\nwhen a hem is lowered.\\r\\n\\r\\n283. Serviceable Child\\'s Dress.--A quaint little frock that will be\\r\\nserviceable, can be made from a remnant of demi flouncing hemstitched on\\r\\nthe embroidered edge. This placed at the hem, of course, and the top is\\r\\ngathered in Mother Hubbard style into a neck band edged with a little\\r\\nfrill. The sleeves are in bishop style confined with bands trimmed to\\r\\nmatch the neck.\\r\\n\\r\\n284. Convenience for the Sewing Room.--A good sized waste basket should be\\r\\ncontinually close to every sewing machine. Then it is easy to form the\\r\\nhabit of dropping all scraps into it just as the scissors make them,\\r\\ninstead of leaving them to litter about the floor.\\r\\n\\r\\n285. Buttons for Future Use.--When buttons are removed from a dress for\\r\\nfuture use they should be loosely strung on a thread before being put in\\r\\nthe button box. This is a time-saver as well as keeps the buttons from\\r\\ngetting lost or several of a set from being used.\\r\\n\\r\\n286. Basting Long Seams.--When basting long seams, if the edge of the\\r\\nmaterial is slipped under the machine needle and the needle is lowered it\\r\\nfirmly holds the two pieces, and one can more quickly do the work.\\r\\n\\r\\n287.--Mending Table Linen.--A woman who is expert in mending table linen\\r\\ndoes it in this manner: A piece of linen is coated with white soap, to\\r\\nmake it stiff and the patch is evenly trimmed. This is placed under the\\r\\nhole in the damask after the edges around the hole in the tablecloth are\\r\\nsoaped and trimmed to remove the rough edge.\\r\\n\\r\\n[886 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\n288. Washing Cooking Utensils.--All the cooking utensils should be washed\\r\\nwith soda immediately after they have been used, which will remove every\\r\\ntrace of grease.\\r\\n\\r\\n289. To Make Soft Soap.--Soft soap made from half a pound of shaved hard\\r\\nsoap and two quarts of water will save the soap bill at cleaning time.\\r\\n\\r\\n290. Separate Night and Day Pillows.--If separate night and day pillows\\r\\nare not used, as is now generally done, the bed will look neater if\\r\\nspecial pillow slips are kept to put on over the wrinkled pillow cases by\\r\\nday.\\r\\n\\r\\n291. To Keep An Iron Sink in Good Condition.--To keep an iron sink in good\\r\\ncondition, scrub once or twice a week with hand soap and kerosene. Every\\r\\nnight put a little chloride of lime in the strainer and pour through it a\\r\\nkettleful of boiling water.\\r\\n\\r\\n292. Steaming or Boiling Pudding.--In steaming or boiling puddings, as the\\r\\nwater boils away add more boiling water. If cold water is added, for a\\r\\nshort time at least, the foodstuff will not be boiling, and this state of\\r\\naffairs may prove disastrous to the pudding.\\r\\n\\r\\n293. Cooking Peas.--When cooking peas do not shell them. Wash the pods and\\r\\nput them on to boil. When they are done the pods will break and rise to\\r\\nthe top of the kettle leaving the peas at the bottom. They have a better\\r\\nflavor cooked this way.\\r\\n\\r\\n294. Troubled With Ants.--When troubled with ants in your pantry and\\r\\nkitchen pour kerosene around on the edge of your shelves and on your\\r\\ndoorstep. They will soon disappear.\\r\\n\\r\\n295. To Exterminate Roaches.--A housewife says that a few drops of\\r\\nturpentine sprinkled around where roaches gather will exterminate them at\\r\\nonce.\\r\\n\\r\\n296. How to Economize on Gas.--More gas is wasted in the oven than\\r\\nelsewhere. Often one burner will suffice after the oven has been well\\r\\nheated. It is better to run one burner than to burn two low, as they\\r\\nfrequently go out.\\r\\n\\r\\n297. Less Noise in Washing Dishes.--If your cook insists in washing the\\r\\ndishes in the pantry while the family is still at dessert, insist upon her\\r\\nplacing the dishes to drain upon a heavy turkish towel. It will lessen\\r\\nmuch of the clatter.\\r\\n\\r\\n298. A Useful Article in the Kitchen.--A useful article in the kitchen is\\r\\na small microscope. Show the cook how to use one. She will be so horrified\\r\\nif shown dates, prunes, or figs that are germ infested that she will take\\r\\nspecial pains in washing them. The microscope is also useful to examine\\r\\ncereals, cornmeal, buckwheat and other things which unless kept tight may\\r\\nbe unpleasantly infected.\\r\\n\\r\\n[MISCELLANEOUS RECIPES 887]\\r\\n\\r\\n299. To Restore Freshness to Vegetables.--For the housewife who must\\r\\npractise strict economy, as well as for her who lives at a distance from\\r\\nthe market, it is well to know that cabbage, celery or lettuce and their\\r\\nlike which have lost the first freshness, may be restored by putting first\\r\\ninto warm water, just comfortably warm to the hand, and after fifteen or\\r\\ntwenty minutes, you will be surprised to note that it will have the\\r\\noriginal snappy crispness so much desired. Often the grocer will sell the\\r\\nsecond day celery and lettuce at half price. The above method will freshen\\r\\nsame, and may make quite a saving of bills.\\r\\n\\r\\n300. Worn Brooms or Whisks.--Worn brooms or whisks may be dipped into hot\\r\\nwater and uneven edges trimmed off with shears. This will make the straw\\r\\nharder, and the trimming makes the broom almost as good as new.\\r\\n\\r\\n301. Making Over a Heatherbloom Petticoat.--When you make over a\\r\\nheatherbloom petticoat, do not cut it off at the top and place the drawing\\r\\nstring in again, and do not plait it to fit the band. Instead, place a\\r\\nband around the waist of the person being fitted, pin the petticoat to the\\r\\nband, then make large darts at each seam and cut off that superfluous\\r\\nmaterial that otherwise would need to be put into gathers. It does not\\r\\ndestroy the shape and permits the petticoat to lie smoothly over the hips.\\r\\n\\r\\n302. The Gingham Apron for the Housewife.--The gingham apron for the\\r\\nhousewife at her daily tasks, especially if the maid is out and she has\\r\\nany kitchen work to do, is imperative, and she will find the long apron\\r\\nthat buttons over the shoulders the most acceptable.\\r\\n\\r\\n303. After Cleaning the Sewing Machine.--After cleaning the sewing\\r\\nmachine, several yards of stitching must be accomplished before the\\r\\nmachine runs smoothly and without leaving marks. If you have any long\\r\\nseams on dark material to sew up, sew them now before attempting any light\\r\\nwork.\\r\\n\\r\\n304. To Remove Tangled Threads.--No doubt you often have stopped sewing\\r\\nand patiently picked the threads out of the bobbin under the machine\\r\\nplate, or around the wheels, for this often occurs, says the Woman\\'s\\r\\nNational Daily. Save time in the future by lighting a match and burning\\r\\nout the threads, then brush the ashes off and oil the parts.\\r\\n\\r\\n305. Clothes Rack for Children.--In one home, in the rear hall, is a low\\r\\nrack on which children can hang their coats, hats and mittens when they\\r\\ncome in from school. The hanger was made with two stout steel brackets and\\r\\na curtain pole fitted up with hooks on which the articles were held. On\\r\\none end of the pole was hung a whiskbroom, and each tot was taught its\\r\\nuse.\\r\\n\\r\\n306. To Remove Dust from Any White Fabric.--To remove dust from any white\\r\\nfabric lay the spot over a tea-kettle of boiling water. Place a cut lemon\\r\\nover the spot, pressing firmly. Remove occasionally, in order to allow the\\r\\njuice to evaporate, and the stain will disappear before one\\'s eyes, no\\r\\nmatter how stubborn or how deep set.\\r\\n\\r\\n888       MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES\\r\\n\\r\\n307. Amateur Dressmakers.--Amateur dressmakers will probably find it\\r\\ndifficult to decide just how to finish the necks of the collarless frocks\\r\\nand waists that will be worn this summer. If the material is net, there is\\r\\nno prettier decoration than a band of the net piped with silk or satin and\\r\\nbraided in a simple design. Necks of tub dresses while there is to be no\\r\\ncontrasting yoke, may be trimmed with a threaded beading.\\r\\n\\r\\n308. To Prevent Marks on the Dining Table.--If you have a highly polished\\r\\ndining table which you are afraid of spoiling, lay a piece of oilcloth on\\r\\nthe table under the pad and you will have no trouble.\\r\\n\\r\\n309. For Cupboard Shelves.--Put a white oilcloth on kitchen shelves\\r\\ninstead of paper. The cloth will not turn yellow as the paper does, and\\r\\ncan be kept clean while washing dishes.\\r\\n\\r\\n310. Cleaning Gilt Frames.--When gilt frames or mouldings of the rooms\\r\\nhave specks of dirt on them they can be cleaned with white of an egg,\\r\\nrubbed on with a camel\\'s hair brush.\\r\\n\\r\\n311. To Clean Kid Gloves.--Take a fine soft cloth, dip it into a little\\r\\nsweet milk, then rub it on a cake of soap, and rub the gloves with it.\\r\\nThey will look like new.\\r\\n\\r\\n312. Washing Fine Woolens.--To keep baby\\'s sacques and socks and your own\\r\\nshawls and scarfs as fluffy as when new, dry and put in oven of range,\\r\\nshaking often between the palms while drying.\\r\\n\\r\\n313. To Wash Grained Woodwork.--To wash grained woodwork take a half pail\\r\\nof hot water, add half a pound of soap chips, and boil until dissolved.\\r\\nTake from fire, add one pint kerosene, then boil for five minutes longer.\\r\\nAdd one quarter of this to a half pailful of warm water. Wash woodwork\\r\\nthoroughly, wipe and dry, and lastly use a flannel to polish with.\\r\\n\\r\\n314. Sewing on Buttons.--How often the mother hears the complaint: \"I do\\r\\nwish you wouldn\\'t sew these buttons on so tightly that I can\\'t button\\r\\nthem.\" When you start to sew on a button, before you take a stitch, lay a\\r\\npin across the face of the button, and sew over the pin. Fasten your\\r\\nthread before you remove the pin, else you will draw the last stitch and\\r\\nspoil it. You will find there is a good shank to the button and yet it is\\r\\nperfectly secure.\\r\\n\\r\\n315. Airing House After Meals.--After each meal, there should be another\\r\\nthorough airing of the lower floor in the home. No matter how perfectly\\r\\nthe system of ventilation, it is impossible to prevent cooking odors. This\\r\\nairing is doubly necessary should there be smokers in the family.\\r\\n\\r\\n316. House Cleaning Hints.--For the last few days before house cleaning,\\r\\nornaments and pictures can be washed at one\\'s convenience. They need only\\r\\nbe removed or covered when a room is cleaned. With these preparations, the\\r\\nactual cleaning can be done quickly and with much less disturbance of the\\r\\nfamily routine.\\r\\n\\r\\n[MISCELLANEOUS RECIPES 889]\\r\\n\\r\\n317. Uses for Men\\'s Old Silk Handkerchiefs.--Men\\'s old silk handkerchiefs\\r\\nshould never be thrown away when worn thin. They are just the thing for\\r\\ndusting the polished surface of the piano, ornaments and fine china and\\r\\nglass and bric-a-brac.\\r\\n\\r\\n318.--Cleaning Fine Fabrics.--In cleaning fabrics great care should be\\r\\ntaken not to rub them roughly between the hands. The gentle rubbing on of\\r\\nthe solvent with a fresh cloth is sufficient.\\r\\n\\r\\n319. To Wash White Woolen Blankets.--To wash white woolen blankets,\\r\\ndissolve four tablespoonfuls of good washing powder in a dipperful of\\r\\nboiling water and pour into a tub of warm water. Open the blanket out wide\\r\\nand put it in the tub and let it soak all over for a half an hour. Then\\r\\nrub it all over between the hands, and if there are any stains left, rub\\r\\nthem with soap. Rinse in clear water of the same temperature as the wash\\r\\nwater. If you do this your blankets will be soft and will not shrink. Do\\r\\nnot rub blankets on a washboard, as it makes them hard, and blueing added\\r\\nmakes them a dull gray color.\\r\\n\\r\\n320. To Take Out Wagon Grease.--To take out wagon grease, which is of two\\r\\nkinds, that made from coal tar may be removed from cloth by an application\\r\\nof petroleum; the other, made from animal fat, responds to a sponging of\\r\\nether.\\r\\n\\r\\n321. Old Perspiration Stains.--Old perspiration stains may be removed by\\r\\napplying oxalic acid and water in solution, one part of the former to\\r\\ntwenty parts of the latter.\\r\\n\\r\\n322. Eyelet Embroidery.--Eyelet embroidery is one of the daintiest as well\\r\\nas the simplest of embroideries, and, best of all, with a little practice\\r\\nthe work can be accomplished quite rapidly. Eyelet embroidery is equally\\r\\neffective done on sheer or heavy material; and neat sewing is all that is\\r\\nrequired to gain good results.\\r\\n\\r\\n323. A Convenience for the Household.--A convenience for the household,\\r\\nthat will be appreciated by men as well as women, is a wire rack to hang\\r\\nin the closet. It has a series of projecting arms upon which coat hangers\\r\\nmay be placed without interfering with each other. This greatly augments\\r\\nthe closet room. This rack may be slipped over an ordinary closet hook,\\r\\nand will accommodate five coat hangers.\\r\\n\\r\\n324. To Turn the Hems of the Table Linen Easily and Accurately.--To turn\\r\\nthe hems of the table linen easily and accurately, remove the needle from\\r\\nyour sewing machine, adjust the hemmer to the desired width and pass the\\r\\ngoods through. They are then ready for hemming by hand. You will find this\\r\\nsaves a great deal of time, and gives you a straight, even hem.\\r\\n\\r\\n325. Soft Wood Floors to Paint.--If a soft wood floor is glue sized,\\r\\nbefore painting, it will take less paint.\\r\\n\\r\\n[890 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\n326. Hanging Out Quilts.--When hanging out quilts and pillows, pound and\\r\\nbrush them the first thing, and let the fresh air get into them all day.\\r\\nMost people do this just before taking them in. Consequently the beds did\\r\\nnot get the proper airings.\\r\\n\\r\\n327. Paint that Sticks to Glass.--Paint that sticks to glass can be\\r\\nremoved with hot vinegar.\\r\\n\\r\\n328. Books with Delicate Bindings.--Books with delicate bindings which\\r\\nhave become soiled through much handling, can be satisfactorily cleaned by\\r\\nrubbing with chamois skin dipped in powdered pumice stone.\\r\\n\\r\\n329. Cleaning Silverware.--Old tooth brushes and nail brushes, and old\\r\\nknitted underwear should always be reserved for cleaning silver. Nothing\\r\\nis better than a tooth brush for brushing the dried whiting out of the\\r\\nheavily chased silver or repousse work. The chamois skin is best for the\\r\\nfinal polishing. If table silver be steeped in hot soap suds immediately\\r\\nafter being used, and dried with a soft clean cloth, a regular cleaning\\r\\nwill not be needed so often.\\r\\n\\r\\n330. Cleaning Crockery and Enamel.--By immersing, for a day or two in sour\\r\\nmilk, glass, crockery or enamel ware articles may be perfectly cleaned of\\r\\nstains or limey accumulations from hard water. This is much better than a\\r\\nscouring, as the surface is not injured in any way, and every part can be\\r\\nreached.\\r\\n\\r\\n331. Going to Market.--The housekeeper who goes to market rather than\\r\\norder by telephone will find she gets better things for less money.\\r\\n\\r\\n332. Moths in Carpets.--If moths have attacked the carpet try putting\\r\\ngasoline on the edges, soaking the nap of the carpet. Also work powdered\\r\\nborax into the carpet wherever there is a sign of moths or under heavy\\r\\npieces of furniture, which cannot easily be moved in the weekly sweeping.\\r\\n\\r\\n333. A Serviceable Furniture Brush.--A serviceable furniture brush is made\\r\\nof turkey tail feathers. Take a stout twine and needle, sew the quills\\r\\ntightly together and cover the handle with a piece of oilcloth, smoothly\\r\\nstitched into place, or wrap the handle with cloth and stitch. A brush of\\r\\nthis kind is very soft and may be used to dust any highly polished piece\\r\\nof furniture.\\r\\n\\r\\n334. Uses of a Wooden Spoon.--Never use any but a wooden or silver spoon\\r\\nto stir anything with in cooking. Many a dish is spoiled by the cook\\r\\nstirring it with an iron or metal spoon. Wood is the best when any acid,\\r\\nsuch as vinegar, is used in the ingredients to be stirred.\\r\\n\\r\\n335. Boiling Vegetables.--Boil parsnips and such vegetables with thin\\r\\nskins; then peel when cold. The flavor is preserved and your hands are not\\r\\nstained.\\r\\n\\r\\n336. To Wash Furniture.--Furniture washed with castile soap and tepid\\r\\nwater and rubbed with a piece of old silk will look like new.\\r\\n\\r\\n[MISCELLANEOUS RECIPES 891]\\r\\n\\r\\n337. Old Suitcases and Purses.--When suitcases and purses begin to show\\r\\nwear, coat all the spots with tan water color paint, and when perfectly\\r\\ndry rub over with a little sweet oil. Let stand for an hour, then rub with\\r\\nwoolen cloth. Tan and brown shoes which have become scuffed may be treated\\r\\nin the same way.\\r\\n\\r\\n338. Putting up Lunches.--Those who find the putting up of lunches a part\\r\\nof the daily routine may take comfort in the suggestion of one resourceful\\r\\nwoman. When using eggs she sees to it that only a small piece of the shell\\r\\nis broken off from the end of one egg. The egg shell from which the piece\\r\\nhas been cut is then washed and kept as a receptacle for jelly or jam for\\r\\nthe noon lunch basket. The open end being protected by a piece of paper\\r\\ndipped in paraffin.\\r\\n\\r\\n339. Paint Wicker Furniture.--If you must paint wicker furniture see that\\r\\nyou buy paint that is well mixed and thinned to the proper consistency. If\\r\\ntoo thick it gets lumpy and the paint is apt to rub off on the clothes.\\r\\nPorch chairs which are exposed to weather should be finished with a coat\\r\\nof enamel to make them last longer. The coat of enamel is also more easily\\r\\ndusted.\\r\\n\\r\\n340. Bureau Drawers that Stick.--Wax is better to use on the bureau\\r\\ndrawers that stick than soap. It works better and will not catch dirt so\\r\\nmuch.\\r\\n\\r\\n341.--Uses for Old Envelopes.--Cut out the corners from all heavy\\r\\nenvelopes, for they are excellent for holding coins sent by mail. They\\r\\nalways make good corner protection.\\r\\n\\r\\n342. To Prevent Fruit from Moulding.--A layer of absorbent cotton laid\\r\\nover the fruit in the mouth of the fruit cans is an excellent preventive\\r\\nagainst the mould. If mould should form, it will cling to the cotton and\\r\\nleave the fruit clean.\\r\\n\\r\\n343. Linoleum or Oilcloth That is Cracked.--Linoleum that is badly cracked\\r\\nmay be improved by a filler made of ochre and boiled flour paste. After\\r\\nthe filling is dry the linoleum may be painted.\\r\\n\\r\\n344. Borax as a Purifier for Ice Box.--Borax is an invaluable aid to the\\r\\nwoman who wishes to keep her ice box immaculate. It is especially\\r\\ndesirable for use in small refrigerators where little food is kept, and\\r\\nwhere ice is kept more for the purpose of preserving butter and milk and\\r\\nkeeping bottled water cool. Cold water with plenty of pure borax, is\\r\\npreferable to hot water to use in wiping off the walls of the\\r\\nrefrigerator. It does not heat the box and, being a germ killer, it\\r\\npurifies everything it touches. It may also he put in the corners of the\\r\\nrefrigerator. Its best use of all is perhaps in keeping the receptacle for\\r\\nthe ice itself and the outside tube in pure and sanitary condition. It may\\r\\nbe sprinkled freely over the bottom of the ice box proper and on the rack\\r\\nholding the ice.\\r\\n\\r\\n345. To Clean Gilded Surfaces.--To clean gilded surfaces, dip a soft brush\\r\\nin alcohol to which a few drops of ammonia water have been added, and with\\r\\nit go over the surface. Do not rub roughly or harshly. In about five\\r\\nminutes the dirt will have become soft and easy of removal. Then go over\\r\\nthe surface again gently with the same or similar brush dipped in rain\\r\\nwater. Now lay the damp article in the sunlight to dry. If there is no\\r\\nsunlight place it near a warm (but not hot) stove, and let dry completely\\r\\nin order to avoid streaks, taking care that the position of the article,\\r\\nduring the drying is not exactly vertical.\\r\\n\\r\\n[892 MOTHERS\\' REMEDIES]\\r\\n\\r\\n346. Hints for the Housewife.--Every housewife should have plenty of waxed\\r\\npaper or paraffin paper about the house. It is of the greatest value in\\r\\npreserving eatables from the air and keeping them properly moist. In the\\r\\nsandwich basket it is indispensable. Cake wrapped in it will keep moist\\r\\nand fresh for a much longer time than if put directly into the box. When\\r\\nthe paper has become sticky run cold water on it, and it may be used\\r\\nagain. Cheese wrapped up in it and put in the refrigerator will keep fresh\\r\\nfor a week.\\r\\n\\r\\n347. Excessive Gas Light Weakens the Eyes.--When the excessive light of\\r\\nthe gas light or the electric bulb tires weak eyes, resort to the tallow\\r\\ncandle. For the sick room wax candles are preferred, as they never produce\\r\\nsmoke or smell. They seem to soothe the nerves of the invalid and in this\\r\\nway help to produce a restful night.\\r\\n\\r\\n348. Handy Disinfectant for the Household.--Chlorate of lime moistened\\r\\nwith vinegar and water, equal parts, is a handy disinfectant for the\\r\\nhousehold. It can be kept in the cellar, and in case of sickness a few\\r\\ndrops scattered around the house will purify the air.\\r\\n\\r\\n349. For Closing Windows.--A piece of bamboo, an old blind roller, or any\\r\\nstrong smoothly rounded stick about three feet long, with a small flat\\r\\npiece of wood about the same thickness, twelve inches long and covered\\r\\nwith flannel, nailed across the ends, makes an admirable and useful\\r\\narticle for closing top windows without either going outside or standing\\r\\non a stool or a chair to reach, or straining one\\'s self with the weight to\\r\\nbe raised upward.\\r\\n\\r\\n[ MEDICAL DICTIONARY 893]\\r\\n\\r\\nMEDICAL DICTIONARY\\r\\nSIMPLE and PLAIN DEFINITIONS of MEDICAL TERMS\\r\\nFor Reference in your Newspaper and\\r\\nGeneral Reading and Throughout this Work.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbdomen (ab-do\\'men).

It\\r\\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\\r\\nfrom people in all walks of life.\\r\\n\\r\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\r\\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\\xe2\\x84\\xa2\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\\xe2\\x84\\xa2 collection will\\r\\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\\r\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\r\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg\\xe2\\x84\\xa2 and future\\r\\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\\r\\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\\r\\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\\r\\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\\r\\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s EIN or federal tax identification\\r\\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\\r\\nU.S. federal laws and your state\\xe2\\x80\\x99s laws.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\\r\\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\\r\\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s website\\r\\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\r\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg\\xe2\\x84\\xa2 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\\r\\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\\r\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\r\\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\\r\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\\r\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\r\\nstatus with the IRS.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\r\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\r\\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\r\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\r\\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\\r\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\\r\\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\\r\\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\r\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\r\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\r\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\r\\n\\r\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\r\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\r\\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\\r\\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\\r\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\\r\\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\\xe2\\x84\\xa2 electronic works\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\\r\\nGutenberg\\xe2\\x84\\xa2 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\\r\\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\\r\\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\\xe2\\x84\\xa2 eBooks with only a loose network of\\r\\nvolunteer support.\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg\\xe2\\x84\\xa2 eBooks are often created from several printed\\r\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\\r\\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\\r\\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\\r\\nedition.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\\r\\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\\xe2\\x84\\xa2,\\r\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\r\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\r\\n\\r\\n'}"
